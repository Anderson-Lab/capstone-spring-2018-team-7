        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "This game is amazing. I've only ever played on mobile since it's hard to find time to play video games. I fell in love within the first game. This mobile version is so good especially being an early release. It only takes up 205mb of storage and runs amazing even on my Honor 7x which is a great phone but is known to be not the best with higher end gaming. I'm very impressed with this game and I'll keep playing it!",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really."

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!"

        "It is a fun offline game that dose not have beautiful graphics but they appeal to the eyes the only complaint i have with the game is when it gives you the opportunity to continue your game by watching an ad you cant click the back button to automatically bring you back to the main menu. I hope you make the main menu button apear immediately or allow you to click your back button to go to the menu of the game but other than that AMAZING game!",
        "I bought the app to get rid of the annoying ads. However, they are still there and nothing has changed. Emailed the developer and never got a reply. It's a fun game but customer support seems to be lacking. Will be requesting a refund.",
        "I love the game, but you need to create more game modes. Yeah sure the bosses are nice and all but they get really boring after playing them over and over and over again. You need to liven up your game with different game modes/types to keep people coming back for more knife madness!",
        "I was at stage 23 on monster, and stage 15 on pirate, the game started lagging, so I stopped playing for ONLY a day, and ALL my game data got deleted! I was back at stage 1 on all my challenges, and I had none of my knifes. I am very disappointed, I really liked this game until this happened. I hope ketchapp and estoty fixes this issue.",
        "Game lags in the most critical moments, I've lost so many times just because of lag that happens unexpected. Throws the knife into the next knife even if there is plenty of space. Fix that and I will give for sure 5 star rating."

Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "Fun off the bat... But then it slows down to a brutal snails pace. It's a great concept, it just needs a lot more updates!  *Slow claps* great work on the \"updates\". I shouldn't have updates in parenthesis.. The characters are cool, leveling is also a cool touch, and a whopping 7 new bats? Killing it!..? But come on, way to go extreme overboard on the speed! All the other bad reviews cover it better. I just wanted to also sarcastically congratulate your update.",
        "pretty good game, glad they're updating it and adding in more bats. I play it when I'm waiting at the airport. the new update sped things up, made it really buggy. resets your hits at 44000 M and isn't really playable at this point, hopefully it's fixed soon",
        "I was enjoying the game until i got to higher lvl when it all went wrong. Every time you hit the ball perfect or not it goes out of play making it impossible to play or lvl up. It would be good to fix this issue so the game has more longevity. I only got to play for a couple hours before this issue started",
        "Latest update totally destroyed the game. Even using the basic bat hitting it perfectly straight it takes the ball 2 seconds to fly 100,000 meters and then the game resets back to swing again. Without even getting to actually make any currency for upgrades"

No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall.",
        "I've been playing this game for a long time and love it. The only annoying Thing is that in some challenges. Even if I come first or second. It deduct point and I didn't even loose. Which is starting to become very annoying"

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update.",
        "The fast rechargeable tackles should be removed.  The game is no fun now. Earlier I had to time my tackle perfectly so that I don't give away second balls. And same with the attack. I tried to get tackled in an area where I can win second ball. But now this fast tackle recharge has just ruined the game."

        "Hello NetEase, thank you for this wonderful game. I have been playing RoS for a few months now. Lovely game but after the last update, my game freezes at the server screen. After several attempts if at all the server menu loads, the game kicks me out when I try to login my account. I tried repairing the game many times, reinstalled it too many times, but the same problem persists. Hope your team will look into the matter soon. Thank you!",
        "I love the Game. Great Gameplay and Controls.. but maybe the Worst in technical issues. Reinstalled dozen times and Repaired using there repair icon on start menu (because of always server busy). Game always updates especially on patches .. Spent more time on fixing the game to make it work than playing it. And ..l.. for your latest update. Btw. My phone is s8+. And got decent internet connection.",

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help.

        "Latest update: The agressive pop up ads are gone and have been replaced by video ads. Even when connected to mobile data services. I wouldn't say this is an improvement. Draining my data volume for advertisement is not nice. It's just greedy. This app is producing so much money anyways, why video ads? Wouldn't normal images be enough?  Past Updates from this point: The agressive advertisement is back and it's worse than ever. There are huge amounts of unauthorised browser popups partly midgame and even when the app is simply running in the background. This needs to be addressed!  Earlier: I like this app a lot. The concept behind it is great and it's great fun to play. The questions are mostly balanced aside from the annoyingly football heavy sports category. Lately though the app kept opening up dubious websitest, usually at the beginning of a round. This is absolutely untolerable (!). It should not have the permission to do this. I've been hoping for the latest fee updates to fix this - they didn't.",
        "There are sometimes pop ups WHILE playing, so the screen is just white and I have no chance to answer the question. After that it says \"time over\" even tho I could never tryna answer it",

        "Too little game between the advertisements.",

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",

        "The game is nice, the graphics is cool and all but I could rarely play it, why? Because when I click the restart button then click the screen I would always end up behind the starting point even though I didn't move yet I die immediately why is that? pls fix it, everyone who played this game of yours would appreciate that.☺️😉 (btw I kept on dying on the first part of the game because of that so....I deleted the game!😀).",
        "Just extremely broken, can't even play the game without the ball not touching the first platform and falling off the map or the game's score just going up while nothing is happening. The game is too hectic and the gravity is too much compared to the last update. It's a really good idea but I hope this isn't just a quick grab for cash.",
        "Having to restart the app every time you want to play instead of being able to hit RESTART sucks.  The app won't let you restart a game without a glitched ball each time.  Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",
        "The game is extremely broken. I can't start a game without falling off the map, and there are times when I don't even play it's a blank screen and my points meter goes up. It's a very broken game I'm thoroughly disappointed.",
        "it is extremely broken. after the first death, it starts you out right in front of the start platform and you cant play it again unless you completely close the app. its a shame that they dont even test the game before they launch it and that google play cant prevent it from launching in the first place. great game, but extremely broken.",
        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",

        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "Love the game but in the last couple days, I'll get into a warp and it'll freeze completely on me. And It truly disappoints me because I could've had so many coins by now. I cannot play the game at all with it not freezing and making me start over.. I don't know if it's a virus or what but I wish it would get fixed."

        "I love the game and then when i saw that there was 3D projects i was so excited but they did not meet my expectations the controls were a little hard and the graphics were a little shady. Also there is a lot of adds i don't mind some adds but there's just so much so it would be nice if you cut down on the adds. Over all i really like the game i love that i don't need Wi-Fi to play this.",
        "Ghoulishness hzhdhdhdh VC Bob hzhdhdhdh hzhdhdhdh VC USD per the attached resume and cover and I will send a private youweirdo if you are doing well and that was the we can do it again but this is a nice day you can get the same thing happened to me and see if you have a nice weekend and I will have a good idea for a little while to get a good time to do this is an automatically by Microsoft outlook for iOS and room and the best way to do with the room and the fact I have to be busy and I am going be able but screen software to view the full image to open in full size and weight of the time to get it done by then and I have a great day room for the late response I got the email address to send me the link below to verify that the same as the one that was the best regards.. room was not able and the fact I am.",
        "Simply love it, if i may make a suggestion... how about providing an option to hide the finished works from the first tab? That way one would not have a lot of scrolling to do find a new piece to start. :) keep up the good work! 👍",
        "This game is AWESOME!!! and Everytime the game updates their app it adds more exciting options to playing the game such as creating your own pictures from your picture gallery folders or other of your downloaded photos from your picture galleries or saved photos. It's so much fun. I also find it to be a Great stress reliever for me. ThaNkS, pixel art app. I love this game, I find time each day to play... Very Relaxing 🤗🤗😀😀😉😉.",
        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too.",
        "Great way to relax or calm down. Lots of choices without having to earn game coin to buy more that only disappoint. Mix of both easy and challenging. One thing would improve over all play and that would be an easy way to locate any missed cells at the end of a puzzle. Having to scroll through some of those detailed ones to find one or two blanks can be a real headache! Other than than i think this is the best color game I have tried! Keep up the great work!!"

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",

I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

I wish you'd left in the settings so if we wanted the moving graphics we could have them. And, if not, the they'd be totally still and not distracting.  Make everyone happy that way. :,( Will be uninstalling this now.",

If u give good comments n ur planning to play this game for the rest of ur life...... Well, in 2 days u will need a new phone n u will end up buying a new one. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME I REPEAT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME.",

Hardly noticed any ads, which was also really nice. One of the BEST free games to take your mind off things!",

Make an option to use those gems for shots instead of real cash would be nice but still earned 5 stars. Samsung galaxy note 8",

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "Game sucks donkey *****. You play maybe 10 beginner holes and get chests that open in 12 seconds. THEN you play a normal hole and get a chest that doesn't open for 4hrs. You only get four chest slots so that means you can only win four holes then you have to wait 4hrs (or 8 or 12hrs depending on the chest you choose to open) before you can get anything for winning a hole. In two days, I haven't even played 18 holes. Guess you gotta have money if you wanna play. Thought I trusted the \"Editors Choice\" games, guess not.",
        "Love the game, but its not perfect. You could make the textures better and add more detail in each level bc right now they look empty. Also matchmaking is garbadge, and I get matched against people with much higher trophy counts and far better clubs... Fix this bs please."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

        "Great game most fun I've had on a mobile phone in years. Need to add wider turning radius so drifts are better and longer. Cars slide to much or maybe the cars are heavy? Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",
        "Hang it up yet info it yet info username and yet I've used back but isn't it is it is to see the in person but I don't have a Instagram account and follow me on Instagram account and I have a lot going I look forward to hearing back from you close by and I will be there for you close the door and it going to be thankful I look forward to seeing the new Star is it possible that I look cute and he is it is to be done by the time I look forward to seeing the new one and I can you know what time you are available",
        "This is a fun game. I'm still personally waiting on that police chase mode. Also, can there be engine mods and body mods, and some more low end cars?😀",
        "There is a glitch in this game when u go to airport by the wall u keep on falling !! I dont knew i fall for 800000 mts and i didnt got the bonus 🤣🤣 crazy"

        "I don't write reviews on games , but this one is impressive. Once I tweaked the settings the graphics became amazing, love that there is NO wait time for upgrades ! You buy it, you own it . Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

        "Ads after ever single try, even if you only play for 5 seconds before you die. If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "What I couldn't even get taken to dinner before being forcibly bent over with ads? I mean with in 45 seconds; I downloaded, opened, played 2 games, and BAM! There it is. What, you couldn't even butter a brotha up? Hell I'd even been fine being lathered up with 10 minutes. Soo ok, I bite, i watch the ad. Attempt number 3 is going well l, bam I die. Tap to continue, well there's a 5 second cool down for revive I didn't notice at first. So I think to myself \"well that's probably what I watched the ad for.\" Wait the cool down, tap to continue. So I tapped, and BAM! ANOTHER AD. Hmm welp you wanted a rating and here it is. Give me about 5 minutes of gameplay before two back to back ads and I might consider having the game installed longer.",
        "DO NOT PAY TO GET RID OF ADS!! IT'S A SCAM...IVE PAID AND IT DID NOT WORK. EMAILED THEM TWICE NOW OVER A MONTH. NO RESPONSE AFTER THOSE ATTEMPTS. Great game but deliver to customers when they give you money VOODOO. And a simple email would be nice jeez",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "Paid to have add removed, no add were removed! Reading though the comments it's seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way. Bit of a shame as I wanted to like this game but it makes it impossible to tolerate for more than a couple of goes as the add pop up every time still!!"

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

    "description" : "Chess in your AndroidChess is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries, and is a national hobby in Russia.Features:- five different themes- seven levels of difficulty- two players mode- game assistant (Helper)- realistic graphics- sound effects- small size",

The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat (&apos;check&apos;) to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.<br><br>During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player (&apos;White&apos;) has pieces of a light color; the other player (&apos;Black&apos;) has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent&apos;s pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.<br><br>Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries, and is a national hobby in Russia.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- five different themes<br>- seven levels of difficulty<br>- two players mode<br>- game assistant (Helper)<br>- realistic graphics<br>- sound effects<br>- small size",

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is actually good. The biggest downside is that there's A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT to watch during playing. I know this is a free game, but c'mon! Waiting and watching minutes of the advertisement is longer than playing the game itself. Not to mention the conversation between characters in the game also took too long to wait and there's some things need to use real money before it can be explored.  This kind of game supposed to be fun and gives the cha cha feeling, but instead I get frustrated of waiting for the advertisement to finish before I can continue playing.  Out of all that, this game is great."

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn't give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star",

There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.",

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS.",

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Actually it is much easy and had very less features. It is not like a competitive game. In 2hours I have nearly unlocked 31 levels.  Make it a tough one....graphics is good but lots & lots of ads, very annoying ! And add scores there rather than medals",
        "This is a very fun game, even though the screen freezes almost every time I go directly to the next level. I have to close it completely and then reopen it - Please fix this then I will rate it 5 stars.",
        "Fun playing. Passes some idle time. Habit forming. How much more do I need to say before get something free? Lol...",
        "Meh!!! It not what i expected I'd like to do the training but also the 1 on 1 competition. If any1 know of a pool app. Hit me up.",
        "Great game....way too many ads. I would pay for an ad free version since the ads annoy me so much that I'm going to wind up uninstalling it."

        "Over the few years of playing I have installed, uninstalled & reinstalled the game all due to frustrations of not being able to complete the higher levels ( usually around the higher 30 lower 40 's )   After spending considerable time, large amounts of the points to purchase all the options offered I am still unable to win, move up in levels due to the set difficulty of the game. I therefore uninstall, only to find myself in no time at all missing the game...the challenge & reinstalling the app.  👍👍👍  Good job to the developers.",
        "I don't like that strong competitive advantages are behind pay walls. These advantages make PVP almost unplayable because of how unfair it is for those who haven't paid real world money for them. Also, one of my fully upgraded non-starter ships was completely reset.",
        "Great game. Would have given it 5 stars but a recent update has made the commercials play at max volume. I play the game in silent mode, in bed, while wife is asleep. Sudden barrage of loud commercials has ruined the experience. It has actually resulted in me playing less and therefore has had me watch less commercials. Go figure.",
        "For some reason all the videos have stopped working. The double coins video, the video for another life and the video to allow an extra spin of the wheel, please fix and I will 100% change my rating",
        "Hard to win PvP when you can't get any power ups. Need to make it more fair. I have no trouble losing a game but when you make it to level 4 and only got 1 power up. Almost impossible to have a chance",
        "Tried multiple times for them to give me my purchase, I have shown them the evidence and they agree I don't have my in game purchase and have been trying to fix it for ten days and won't issue a refund. Horrible customer service"

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",

        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "Game sucks donkey *****. You play maybe 10 beginner holes and get chests that open in 12 seconds. THEN you play a normal hole and get a chest that doesn't open for 4hrs. You only get four chest slots so that means you can only win four holes then you have to wait 4hrs (or 8 or 12hrs depending on the chest you choose to open) before you can get anything for winning a hole. In two days, I haven't even played 18 holes. Guess you gotta have money if you wanna play. Thought I trusted the \"Editors Choice\" games, guess not.",
        "Love the game, but its not perfect. You could make the textures better and add more detail in each level bc right now they look empty. Also matchmaking is garbadge, and I get matched against people with much higher trophy counts and far better clubs... Fix this bs please."

The game itself is a lot of fun. I enjoy it a lot and its great time killer. But NOT getting what I PAID FOR does not make me a happy customer. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed.",
        "Way too many ads. Every two games you get 30 seconds of advertisment. At one point an ad popped up during my game and made me lose. Played this for 5 minutes and uninstalled, dont even bother to download the game.",
        "I always play games with music in the background and while playing this game my music would be constantly shut off because of the ads, I don't mind the ads themselves, just the fact that it constantly interrupts other sounds playing on the system is very irritating. Gave you 2 stars for a nice game, didn't play a lot though so couldn't tell you more.",
        "This game is fun to play, however, I hate how on every Voodoo app that doesn't require Wi-Fi to play, the only way to stop being bombarded with 5000000000 ads, I have to turn my Wi-Fi and data off, otherwise the game play is ruined. This is a problem that really needs to be addressed. I read the reviews before downloading, so I know it's a consistent problem.  FYI, if you wanna play without all the ads, just turn your data and Wi-Fi off. It's a nuisance, but so are the ads.",
        "Just listen to all of the reviewers and don't download this app! I got about thirty seconds of game-play, then an ad popped up. The ad lasted about a minute, and after that, my phone started glitching out.",

        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I still love this game! However I have yet to change my mind about the fact that it takes longer to vote just for 3 stars at a time, than to actually design the max of 5 designs per day. Can you not increase stars won per vote? Can you not make designs brief even more compulsory as many designers dont follow the brief and you just end up losing votes because your design is too colourful or eclectic",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget."

        "I really like this game because 1, it is funny, a sausage running through a kitchen dodging all these obstacles, you have to admit that is kinda funny, 2nd I like how you can unlock so many different sausage skins, who would have thought that there would be so many different kinds of sausage, and finally, 3rd, I also like how you can play with other people, you can play with other people because you can take turns, when one person dies in the game it's the next persons turn. This game is awesome and all about tactics, and I love it. This game deserves a five star!🖒",
        "The game it's self isn't bad but it's also nothing new. It's just a copy off of different idea's but that does't really matter. What matters is that there's a constant redirect ever 30 seconds! It sends you to a website and it's often and very stupid... And if a redirect isn't bad enough it no joke happens to me in the middle of game play. You can be playing and all the sudden here comes a redirect... !",
        "This game is extremely glitchy. Also I see great time killer on EVERY APP! Are the developers doing this? I don't know but, that doesn't take away the fact that it's SUPER LAGGY!",
        "Loved the game, but every minute or so the game will minimise and chrome will open to some page in poor English saying \"you have 4 virus!! Etc, etc.\" Not even sure if its this developer's fault or not,  but the game is unplayable because of that spam ad...",
        "The new black characters you put out are terrible (bolt and williams). Its like youre making fun out of them. They are so detailed in a bad way. And everyone else like justin bieber look \"normal\". Yall need to do better 🙄🙄🙄🤡🤡🤡."

After players matching ,game is hacked/stopped by several times.Only way to win that kind of match,any of one player has to quit or network issues.Its waste of time,also harm for devices (battery drainage,high heating). So,admin plz look after these prob.Why it's hanging or hacking.",

The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "Could you please enable the user to save his progress in a Gmail account??  So that, when you lost or change your phone, you can recover the level and progress you had before instead of restarting from the beginning!!!!!!!!!!!!   If you could allow more media for sharing the game, it would be better, Facebook is not the only social media!!   And sometimes, it bugs!! Sometimes, the game is very slow and causes you to lose. Indeed, you shoot but the ball goes after many seconds even though the connexion is good!! Consequently you loose against a weak player, And this makes very angry!!!   Should those problems fixed, I will rate 5 stars.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person."

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",

Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",

I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

        "Fun game so far but one issue I think I have is the performance for some reasons when I'm playing if I attack a camp it gets SUPER laggy and it runs smoothly when I'm not attacking and just upgrading the camp. And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon. It's a good game but you've been warned..."

        "Great game most fun I've had on a mobile phone in years. Need to add wider turning radius so drifts are better and longer. Cars slide to much or maybe the cars are heavy? Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",
        "Hang it up yet info it yet info username and yet I've used back but isn't it is it is to see the in person but I don't have a Instagram account and follow me on Instagram account and I have a lot going I look forward to hearing back from you close by and I will be there for you close the door and it going to be thankful I look forward to seeing the new Star is it possible that I look cute and he is it is to be done by the time I look forward to seeing the new one and I can you know what time you are available",
        "This is a fun game. I'm still personally waiting on that police chase mode. Also, can there be engine mods and body mods, and some more low end cars?😀",
        "There is a glitch in this game when u go to airport by the wall u keep on falling !! I dont knew i fall for 800000 mts and i didnt got the bonus 🤣🤣 crazy"

        "Simple, Nice and Addictive. Almost perfect! But the game build lags from when the log records too many life events, which could be solve with a clean log record button. Another Thing is the name your child gets when your child is born in korea but you are from another country, the kid gets your name instead of your surname as his/her surname",
        "I love it! The only thing I would say is to let is have the option to transition without being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Or at least give us an option on the action board(with the profile of our person) with the option to identify as a transgender at schooling age of 6 or 5. Also, can we have the option to go to early schooling from 2 years? Some people do this. I love this game! It's very interesting and fun.",
        "After so long Google will actually let me review this now! I absolutely guarantee you will have fun with this game. There's so many choices that affect your life, you can be so many different things, and no life is like the other. If you're looking for a quick life simulator game to pass the time, or just play any time at all, this is the game for you.(P.S if you want to transition, you need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Very rare.)",
        "Overall Its time killing for me, and, just some advice, we should have a Save state, because im kinda upset like.. i have played these game for 3 hour to age of 60 and retire and having a 7/8 mansion bedroom but i accidentally clicked back and then its started over again.. I wanted to see ma kids grow lol, but then i clicked it :(",
        "I love this game and it leaves a lot to your imagination. I do have a few things I would really love to see in this game. I would love for there to be 5 bedroom houses. 4 bedroom houses just aren't big enough sometimes and mansions cost WAY to much even if you're making over 100k a year. Also if you can control your children as well as make suggestions to your spouse to get a job, work out, ect. Would be amazing.  I would love to be able to have little grand babies on the game as well as step children. Even though this last one is a small request I would love to have my children in order by age if I adopt an older child then the children I already have without them being at the bottom of the list. It already states that they are adopted in their details tab so they shouldn't have to be at the bottom.",
        "Great fun little life simulation with a lot of potential. Their need to be more career paths other than work, painting, music or ceo. I want to be an athlete, a career criminal, drug runner, politician etc. And the UI needs to be cleaned up. There's no reason why clubbing and holidays shouldn't be under leisure."

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Great game, I totally love it. I don't mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills."

        "This is my favorite game on my phone. I only got it for something else on a different game, but it turned out that I loved it. It is a really fun game and the controls and stuff are easy. The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won..."

Extra blades that just appear and sit in a corner of the screen.  Ads wont count down, and entire app needs to be restarted to get back to home page. Also have the app freeze just after I enter games and lose all the starfruit/gold apples it cost to play, but never even got to open that game. Super pissed and dissapointed.",

I will level up, get my Sword and dojo of Choice then two weeks later for no  it is gone.  I have Stopped playing because I am tired of Starting over on a saved linked account ever couple of weeks.",
        "I'm a great fan of ur game but I don't know why I'm not getting any dojos or blades from daily challenge. I got 1 dojo and 3 blades from daily challenge after that I played 15 days continueosly but I got only 5000 star fruit but no blades or dojos. Please solve this problem I really want to give 5 stars for this awesome game. 😞😞😢😢😩😩",
        "It's a good game.but unfortunately I launched the app once and when I left I couldn't get back.it just crashes over and over again...also when I tried to login to Google play it was an error,even though my internet is fine.thats why I don't want to reinstall it,because I'll loose all my progress:(",
        "Of course I love the game, but I can't get my free star fruit because the videos aren't playing. I can't redeem my free golden apples because of the videos not playing. I've lost out on more than 300 star fruit and 100 golden apples. Please fix this.",
        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime."

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",

One more thing is in real life i know i should put on a blinker when changing lanes but i cant tell if your game does that or not sorry for tge long review i hope it helps tho",
        "It has very good graphics, controls, and it's a very addicting game. On of the best driving games I have played. But there is a problem with the Canada map.

I hope they can fix the Canada map for me.",

(Also sorry for long review and i wasn't shouting just making the point clearer)",
        "It doesnt work. Tries to load I see a car and a stop sign I see it loads me google account then it just closes the app kicking me back to home screen. I have a samsung galaxy s3 yeah its old however I do play gta san andreas on it I should be able to play this.",
        "The game would get a much higher rating if it didnt penalize after each stoplight. It wants you to turn your blinker on at each light regardless if you switch lanes."

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "I've been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment ''Wow, update, ok''. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they've done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can't just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg."

        "I absolutely love this game. The music is good, the challenges are really fun and... well, challenging. It has taken me several days of being asked by the game if I would like to review it because I was having so much fun and didn't want to stop playing long enough to review. But here you have it. This game is well deserving of a great review. I'm going to go back to the game now so I can keep on rushing.",
        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "Minus another star because it's now glitchy and no longer gives daily bonus. I'm on challenge 89 and the point accumulation is taking forever. Minus one star because the ad at the bottom gets in the way while playing. I'll be on a good run and barely graze the ad space and it stops the game and ends the run. Very frustrating.",
        "I'm obsessed with this game. It's not just playing to beat your best score. There are challenges that you can beat as you play and it makes it okay to have a bad run sometimes because you can still beat the challenge lol. Not frustrating, just so much fun. Not sure if my review makes sense, just play this game ok."

Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",
        "Great time killer! On those nights I can't sleep, which is too often, this is the best app to turn my would be long night into an extremely short night. The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "This app is great for passing time, I also love how you can play offline. Its very addicting as well. The only downside is that there are way to many advertisements, I can't even play one song without there being an ad",
        "I mean the game is great! But all of these add-on power up stuff always being added ends up ruining the classic game for me. I love the good original design, no power-ups or anything too extra. I don't use them and find them annoying. It's a great time killer, and a real challenege.  But, as said before, the game is going too extra and I don't really like it.  Playing it is fun, the add-ons are not."

It felt like nearly every time I failed a level it would ask me if the level was too hard and I needed a hint. This game is incredibly obnoxious to play with ads on",

I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.",

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "Fantastic graphics, great controls, overall great game.  Recommended to my friends child.  Some tasks  (i.e., leveling up a character, waiting to clearing a curse, waiting to open a chest...) take too long and their is nothing to do while you wait.  Game has improved tremendously! Love the game, won't stop playing. Thank you Disney!",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game"

On a chess exercise game with a recurring subscription fee to fully unlock?? Every single thing about this game is designed to be such a ridiculous money grab I actually laughed. It does have a very nice interface but there are a lot of completely free or one time purchase alternatives that are every bit as good.. Definitely don't waste your time and money on this..",
        "OK guys as far as the overall experience with the app was good I could use it all the time to progress my skill at playing chess just like anybody i.e.  any practice  1 possible flaw or idea that I've found which may shift Play Magnus app's popularity is to make a free version of the Magnus Trainer app with only the free content intending this app to be a demo and add more daily activities and challenges to keep them on your app longer  which of course will always end prompting the user to download Premium Magnus which requires an initial $5.00  purchase to begin downloading Magnus Trainer Premium enabling user full access to all the content app offers them. Followed by subscription payments made monthly at the set price of $5.   Might be dumb idea but food for thought I know Runescape had their free server separated from Members only servers also at $5 / mo.  People may  be able  to understand more clearly that if they want the full  app to get way better skills on the board if they want lessons of this caliber then it requires subscriptions to support your hard working team.   The haters will always hate... Keep it up good app",

        "This is an amazing app but why do you have to pay for the exclusive lessons. Those are literally the main ones to look at and study. Yeah okay the free ones are good too but I mean I really wanna get awesome at chess. There should be like a 1 month free trail for the exclusive content without having to pay."

        "Was pretty good, liked the levels and the graphics were cool. The combonation of the colours on the black and white were quite nice. The only problem i had was when it came to the controls. Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

        "The game is fun and addictive, and it also has a lot of content but unfortunately there's a bug that hasn't been fixed which is the time. Sometimes on many occasions, the level starts with the time passed like 1-3 minutes. Say I want to get 3 stars in a level by finishing it under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. When I start it, immediately one minute and a half are past without me doing anything and I have to restart the level to get it to zero. Sometimes I forget and end up finishing the level with 2 stars because of that bug and having to restart the level once again. I appreciate your support and offering the game for free but don't forget to get a fix for this bug, please. Thanks 🌹",
        "I enjoyed that it is challenging but still easy enough to feel like it's not impossible. However, there is at least one ad before every level, and sometimes 2-3 ads will come up for each level and this will probably be the reason I end up deleting it.",
        "Fun addictive love it the music the side effects all of it even my six year old daughter likes this game it's fun it's challenging for her it's not your typical solitaire and she's only 6 years old and already she loves it the higher the level the more she said Love's to figure it out great game wonderful brain game for small children teaching strategies great job guys two thumbs way up",
        "Impossible to enjoy game play due to excessively intrusive advertising.  One can't even shuffle without being forced to watch another ad. Banner ads, long boring ads between each level, jammed into players brains (so the developers wish).  I am immune to advertising and simply tune it all out. My only reaction being to UNINSTALL this otherwise enjoyable game and warn others about it's predatory intent.",
        "You get an ad between every game, but its not annoying for me. They're easy to skip. They gotta make money somehow, right? Other than that, the game is really neat and fun to play."

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

I don't know what d problem is please tell me a solution",
        "It would be a really good game if it stops letting me use my coins then when I'm in the game for not even 5 seconds. It would shut down on me and when I login back in my coins are gone. I will like you to fix that",
        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",
        "Its good but the update mess me up because i have so many song that ived by but now i dont have any of it and there s a limit by purchasing a song 2 songs per day? And what happen to the connecting with fb? What the heck",
        "The new update STILL didn't fix the coin limit. And when I tried to buy something with my coins that I didn't have enough coin for it. I lost all my money and it told me I didn't have enough money to buy it! But it's still a good game. Also please put love ward in the game thanks",

        "I don't know if the rumors about  talking Angela and talking Tom are just apps that people use to kidnap children but just to make sure don't turn on ur camera I disbelieve this rumor but who know? Anyway this was a amazing game 5 stars for me I lovebirds so much and it's so addictive she is so adorable",
        "I love the game. But since the recent update I did 2 days ago it crashes out. Every time I try to play the games. Im on the matching game for so long and then it exits itself and when I open it from recent activity it starts over, Angela tired but no credit for the coins I earned. SO UNFAIR.",
        "Okay, I used to love this game. But, ever since the update. The game has been logging me into random accounts (which aren't mine) please fix this..",
        "It's good but most of the beautiful dresses are too expensive.. please decrease the price.. and I liked about the daily deals.",
        "Keeps freezing then closing itself during the games, this new update has flaws. Other than that, it's a lovely game",
        "This app is amaze! But the mini-games are less interesting than in\"my talking tom\""

        "Amazing game that I randomly came across. I simply love how simple the game is. JUST TAP YOUR SCREEN AND EARN COINS AND UPGRADES! It's so awesome and I absolutely love how everything is pixelated and that makes it more charming. Not to mention that the music is fantastic as well and I never get tired of listening to it!",
        "Love this game because you don't have to spend real money, just tap the screen to get coins and also diamonds then upgrade the guns, rinse and repeat but it never gets boring. Only trouble I've had is a sore tapping finger. LOL",
        "This would be a fine time-waster if they reign in the ads, until that happens, about like the plague.  They started out as a means to (optional) easy buffs. Fine, annoying, but not that bad. Suddenly, random ads are popping up in the middle of the game and you get nothing out of it. Totally unacceptable way to run a game. Don't bother, there are thousands of other time wasting idle/incremental games that show an ounce of respect for their customers. These guys simply don't.",
        "this game is basically an app for watching ads. you are forced to watch ads in order to progress. on the top of that, when you upgrade your stuff, the game randomly starts an ad. to have double money, you have to watch an ad. to collect diamonds.. guess what, watch an ad. to start idle mode? yes, watch an ad. utterly disgusting, terrible design.",
        "A great fully free game. It is a bit ad heavy but absolutely no microtransactions so I'm fine with supporting them that way. Very fun game definitely worth a play",
        "Holy ads! Intrusive ads every few clicks. EVERYTHING is ad-based. Good gameplay, but obviously an app created to generate ad revenue."

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

Like its really easy to shift from one side of the screen to the other without taking your finger off your device other games like that don't do that. There are lots of obstacles my one problem is that you can only jump on the small buses like what about the big ones that's a problem that sucks but overall get this game. When you look at the pictures that is exactly what it is its super fun!😁",
        "I like the game but, the think is you can get any lives and sometimes when I swipe the game won't move my character and when you have to get some of your missions and you have to get them in total I hate cause it's very hard and some of the goals are to but, other than that I LOVE the app",
        "I love this game it is so entertaining and you can play it anywhere because you don't have to play with internet. this game can allow you to mix and match the  characters with the cars and even allows you to play different games with dragons dinisours. I love this game!💖💖💖💖💖",
        "I used to like this, but since the update with Lego elves, the gameplay become worst, it's not smooth, I even cannot jump over the bus properly. I use Xiaomi MI5s with Snapdragon 821 and 3Gb RAM, and the graphics and gameplay is still lag",

All other puzzle improve your skills but this isn't since you have no time to caulate the expression it's more a test of memory then calculation because you can only 3 star it if you know the expression by heart if you try workout you answer right but run out of time. You should make is so each correct answer adds time so you can accurately l improve. Also most games are broken with not enough time to do the given task and workout same as previous has no buttons so you can't play it.",
        "The puzzles are simple yet challenging, and there's enough of them to keep your interest for a long time. Star ratings give the game good replay value, and the workout mode is a nice addition for something short and sweet. Ads can get a bit annoying, but there's not too many and the pro version isn't that expensive anyway. As for the skill-building element, I can definitely see a difference in my attention and reflexes since playing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.",

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Actually it is much easy and had very less features. It is not like a competitive game. In 2hours I have nearly unlocked 31 levels.  Make it a tough one....graphics is good but lots & lots of ads, very annoying ! And add scores there rather than medals",
        "This is a very fun game, even though the screen freezes almost every time I go directly to the next level. I have to close it completely and then reopen it - Please fix this then I will rate it 5 stars.",
        "Fun playing. Passes some idle time. Habit forming. How much more do I need to say before get something free? Lol...",
        "Meh!!! It not what i expected I'd like to do the training but also the 1 on 1 competition. If any1 know of a pool app. Hit me up.",
        "Great game....way too many ads. I would pay for an ad free version since the ads annoy me so much that I'm going to wind up uninstalling it."

        "This game is a PUBG clone using Minecraft graphics. Because of that, I downloaded it as a joke. However, this game is surprisingly good. It runs well and is fun, so I would highly suggest getting it.   Edit: I see lots of people talking about boring gameplay, and I think they just haven't had a good game. After over 50 games and plenty of wins, this game is always fun to drop in to",
        "I think the only good aspect is auto ahot if i was on the devolper team i would suggest that the frame rate should be worked on. I get crazy kill streaks there should be awards cor that.",
        "It's the worst game I ever played it's sending me off my page just so I can watch an ads please fix this game   I would rate it 5 but please make it stop sending me off my game just to see an ad",
        "I absolutely adore this game! The controls are a bit clunky but other than that the games great!  One thing though, how do you make replays?",
        "This game is really good just got it yesterday and already played 37 games of it. Its not very vilent but its really fun to play",
        "Great gameplay keep the small map but one problem when I shoot at sometimes it counts like he killed me first even though it shows I did"

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Well I think you need better graphics and I don't like how it is slow when you turn. Plus it has TOO MANY ADS! I just started playing this game! The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",
        "I love this game, it's sooooo fun but my only problem is the ads. It was fine when I first downloaded it, there were no ads but after I upgrade the game, all of a sudden there's ads every second. If you can get rid of the ads, I would greatly appreciate it",
        "There's so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to start. First off your in a confined space and if you go so far you just hit a blue wall. If in was infinitely generated and you could go farther it might be better. Second its kind of slow when moving. Third since the whole confined space thing you have each different biome all pushed together so when you walk two steps your in a different biome and its small. So you extremely need to make it better.",
        "So, the game itself is incredibly enjoyable and fun. Sometimes the controls get me here and there, but I'm sure, with time, I'd get use to it. The thing is, THERE IS NO TIME. Literally every minute, I get a thirty second ad. I'm just here building my home and making foundation when all of a sudden, an ad pops up. I say, \"oh okay, it's just one, whatevs.\" WRONG. It is now ten, just over the past 5 minutes. This game has serious potential, if only it'd let us play the game and cut out the ads. I'm spending more time watching ads rather than using time to efficiently play the game. It irks me, so I uninstalled the ap. It really is a good game, just lower the ads from 2 per minute, kay?",
        "Just like minecraft !!! This game is amazing I pick this over mine craft for any body who actually reads reviews like me listen ! This game is amazing ! The only thing I want y'all to fix is that easy mode needs night and that hard mode needs to just give you the supplies you need because some things you need you can't scavenge.",

        "I. Freaking. LOVE this game! I used to love playing it as a child so when I saw it here I decided to give it a chance, and it's so legit! It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone"

The thing is, it took my money, and never gave me the Huge Chest perk! I'm furious right now!! If this can somehow be fixed, or I get my money back, great!

        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",

        "What happened? The game is ruined after the update. I can't purchase a winning start pack and it crashes every 30mins fix it asap we have a lot of event to attend! Unless extend those events and we can wait for a longer time."

        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played and ever will play. I recommend it to everyone. Even if it doesn't look good to you get it its awsome. I think or know you will like it. Also it's so cute and the graphics are awsome. Also everything is priced so well. I love how you add new stuff often. Also you can level up fast, and let go of your purse into a new family. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!,",
        "OMG THE NEW UPDATE IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY SAW MY OLD REVIEW AND DID ALMOST EVERYRHING I ASKED THEM TO DO OMG LOL XD GREAT GAME!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁 COULD NOT B HAPPIER ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! 😝 Edit: ANOTHER AWSOME UPDATE!!! BEST WOLF SIM IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!! 😆 😆 😆 😀 😁 😁 I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN I LOVE MINECRAFT AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING COMING FROM ME!! 😀 😀 😀 😀 😃 😃 😆 😆 😗 😘 😘 I LOVE U TURBO ROCKET GAMES!! 😘 😘"

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "I just started the game a couple of days ago, but I'm already hooked.  Like most games, you kind of learn as you move along, but a little more guiding would be very helpful. Thanks for making a fun game! I am having a problem getting past the loading screen though. I tried clearing cache, forced stop, delete files, even uninstalling and reinstalling again.",
        "Easy to learn with loads of variables to keep it interesting. Graphics are stellar. As with most 'free' games, there are lots of incentives for you to get out your wallet; if you're as unwilling to do so as I am, you'll have to be patient. Can't fault the developers. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though",
        "I don't mind spending money on micro transactions if I like the game, and I do like this game.  But the jems in this game are outrageous, if you wanted to buy jems to buy one ship it would cost you $10-$20, depending on the ship.  Because of this, this developer won't be getting any more than the $4 I've spent on it unless they lower their prices."

        "Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don't lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!",

        "This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there's no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

They're not well-distributed, having reached a point where no ads would show up after a few runs, and then one would appear after every run no matter how short. A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",

It made the app close constantly (even when it wasn't even open and I was in other apps), there's way too many ads that make me want to vomit, and it stats to lag now when it never did before. Someone at corporate ruined this game. Smh."

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "The game is very fun and progression is steady as you get better, on the downside once you get through your first play through with the app and come back later there are 30 second adds that pop up after every other round or so. A little disappointing but no biggie the game is really quite fun.",
        "I feel like I would really like this game but it is not working on the Android phone. So I have never actually played the game but I have tried to open it up like 50 times.  Every time I tried to open it, it would just lag out right when it was going to show me the home screen.  If this gets fixed then I will play this game and most likely enjoy the game but for now it is awful.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them."

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "On level 2185, had over 800 different boosters and suddenly all of them are gone, serious glitch in game... emailed their tech center for over 1 week now and only get a automated response and nothing from a real person. Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than."

FreeFire Battlegrounds is x50 times better and more simply. Go and die in a hole developers.",
        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",
        "Mind Blowing Game..But Could You Guys Please Include \"Voice Chat\" It will Make the game more Awesome.. Its so tough To Contact With Team Mates. In chat box By typing..Please..see in thus matter.. #Devlorpes"

BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",

I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",

The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.",
        "Simple yet clever, Free Flow is about connecting brightly colored dots together without crossing the lines. With an abundance of board shape, size, variety, and difficulty, there's something in free play to challenge nearly everybody. Those who find even the largest puzzles too easy may alternatively challenge themselves in time trials to finish the boards as quickly as possible."

I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn't.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don't let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that's why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That's not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.",
        "Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don't like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.",
        "You know this is the best chess app. The magnus tuned engines works great. You actually improve with each passing day. Few points too. I would have given it 100 stars if possible if the graphic would have been better. The graphic you know, like black and white makes a very depressing combination. Also an option for online game with others would make it a perfect app.",
        "Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.",
        "This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...😁",
        "the engine is actually good, I gave that 1 star for that, yet the interfaces are sluggish, very clunky, slow, and you can't even change the default board colors without playing a lot of this, with ridiculous brainpower credits.  it's slows down my new smartphone too much when another chess apps are practically lightweight. and without good sides such as analysis or online multiplayer matches."

        "I will consider rating the game five stars if you can add new levels and lines, but the \"hearts\" feature forces me to watch ads, even though I paid to remove ads. I will give the game five stars if you gracefully remove the \"hearts\" feature. I'm asking CM a question: \"Will you please change the game back to the original way we played it? And add new levels? 'The Easter' would be creative, and the diamonds can be eggs. How about an Easter Bunny line? I like all the new levels, and the new lines we can unlock. Can you add more remixes to the levels? There are only 3 existing remixes, if CM had forgotten.\"",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "The game starts off really strongly and the concept is unique and the music is fabulous.. but later on things get so progressively difficult it makes flappy bird look like a piece of cake... And in the later on levels there's not much sync between the music and the cube it's really hard to play... I enjoyed it initially but now I'm just going to uninstall it...",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads."

        "Well I liked it at first and I really wanted to get the Batman basketball and I've been trying to get it and I was soo close to unlocking it. Then I noticed that they changed the looks and now it looks horrible and stupid I was disappointed by this plus to many damn ads! PS unupdate the app the older version was better the new one sucks!!",

I might get another game similar to this one but i will have to erase this one. Also, it only gives you a little bit of time.",
        "The game itself is pretty good. But the thing is, there is a point to where it is to much ads. I bet that u make money every time some1 sees an ad on in your game, but u won't make any money if that person stops playing the game because of how much ads. I have been playing this game for 10 minutes and already come across around 100 ads. I might take away some of that cash income because the amount of ads Is insane. Would u rather make No Money, or A decent bit of money?",
        "The game could be better if you tone down the ads a bit more... Maybe 10 games one ad? Or maybe more? Its really annoying when you get ads every end of the round."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",

The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

        "It's good. A decent game that forces you to grind and wait, OR you could spend money to buy gold to open more chests. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that to watch ads to get rewards, I have to give it my LOCATION, ALLOW IT TO MANAGE MY CALLS, and access to my media. Why do you even need my location and phone number to watch an ad for rewards?",
        "Love this time killer. Its a simple game, simple concept. Easy to learn the controls by yourself, and unlock stuff. Simplistic graphics, and will most likely run smooth in any device. Now, the only issue here is, that unlocking a chest is a tad bit too expensive, and gaining coins and stars are a bit hard. Tho, i havent unlocked quests yet, so i dont know. Either way, Awesome game, cant wait for future updates, and i really hope the devs will add new worlds, characters, weapons and customisations maybe?",
        "I love this game in every way. It's a great time killer and it's fun to collect the helmets. The chests don't wait too long to open and the challenges keep you from just messing around. My only complaint is the lack of creativity in the weapons. If I work hard enough to get a new helmet I would like to see at least one unique weapon per helmet. Instead it is a different combination of the regular weapons.",
        "As a 3D MMORPG dev it is hard to find something that is enjoyable on this damned store. However your combination of simplicity mixed with a variety of prefabs and abilitys alongside particles and everything else make this an excellent game. You dont spam ads, you don't make it incredibly difficult and you don't make it pay to win.  A tip of my hat to you guys. I would give this 5 stars if I didn't have a buck fifty skins in my face all the time....",
        "Great game......the only problem in this game is that the lack of information about a weapons..... i wish their are something like a short tutorial about the types of weapons or a short video on what happen if the weapon equiped..... since the game is just currently launch... its normal that it has minor bugs.... but please fix it as soon as the updates come....for a summary: A reallly great game and entertaining",
        "I enjoy the gameplay and various unlock/progression mechanics, but the game is extremely laggy. It may be my device, however. Also, some hitboxes seem to be mercilessly accurate and it can be very frustrating. That may not be something to change, but definitely something to note."

        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

For under $2 my daughter has memory games, puzzles, fingerprinting, math, music, matching,  and the list goes on.  I spend at least $10 on a toy and for $2 it teaches and helps on long car rides and planes rides.  It's a great educational app and not a \"game\".

I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.

First adds would take forever to play then they wouldn't play at all and it would freeze up till you closed it out then my whole phone froze up has NEVER happend before. I UNINSTALLED this game and my phone is back to normal. Not worth screwing up your phone. It's a bit fun but there are other games out there.",
        "Game is fun, but it crashed (Samsung Galaxy S7) and lost all progress. Now had to start again (which is not such a big problem), but then the game glitches and I don't get anything for leveling. Meaning I can't get past car level 4 anymore, because there are simply not enough parking spaces. Will give 5 stars if this gets fixed.",
        "Just a typical merger. I agree the ads are a bit excessive and when you watch ads that actually help you the doubler only lasts 2 1/2 minutes. I like these kind of games though. And now it's take me to spam pop ups. Ugh. Gave it  another try anf This one still has potential...but for now it's getting deleted again.",
        "Too many adds. You keep getting random adds in addition of the adds you are clicking yourself in order to progress. There are many games that following the same policy but getting random adds without a reward while I'm opening just a menu is really annoying",

        "Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don't even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "This game is AMAZING. YOU DEFINITELY need it. There is only 1 thing that I hope this game will have, I really want them to have CPU's on multi-player and on tournaments and duels because it says check your internet connection when I try to play them. But still this game is the best. So if you're searching for a game just get BIKE race and you probably won't need any other game.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Fun game but its lame the only bikes that have boosted stats are super expensive. And it's really dumb that the stats don't scale up with the cost of the bike. They have a range of 100 to 350 with the ultra bike and 300 for the super bike, that leaves plenty of room for various speed levels. The helmet and trick type perks are cool but not enough of an incentive. Need more to play, pay, or fight for."

Love it so much plz make another game like that ive got another sister whos 1 and is gonna start screaming too soon😁😁",
        "Amazingly Awesome!!! Dear Entertaining One,Your Game is Really Nice.But,if you can,please add more characters in the next update like Mommy Pig,Daddy Pig,Grandma Pig and Grandpa Pig because I want to see what they do,like Peppa and George.Both siblings oink or laugh,and that's why I want to add more characters.Even though I'm 10,this game is awesome!

After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",
        "Its a good game but the rewards for tickets are rubbish , last 6 times i claimed gold reward for 1000% more cash , its given less than 200,000 which is rubbish get more for the bronze , needs sorting",
        "I think it is one of the best and most exciting games",
        "This is the best free poker app!",

Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it.",
        "I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.",
        "Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I've only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.",
        "I'm not quite sure what's happened to this game. It's very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android's OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it's going, now it's just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it's own update."

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "Way way WAYYY too laggy. It's an easy casual game though. I wouldn't say it's \"fun\" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That's it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there's no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.",
        "It clicks on adds with out me hitting it at all. Then when I get back to the app it forgets that I watched the add at all even tho I watched all the way through. It happens repeatedly. It only forgets half the time but it almost always clicks on the adds. Other than that it's a good time killer with easy ways to get through it quickly as long as you watch some adds."

It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you.

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

        "ok. add real fight pls why it is like unfinished fight/battle animation. the game is very stupid ... how can you add sleep in middle of game and show zzz sign... so stupid .. at least add some proper fight not using dumb zzz and turn wise attack. and make some friends play this game before putting on store. it's a waste of time",
        "It will make us bored later... Don't play itu too often",
        "Babba Sutter and the wind is getting bad power keeps flickering to make you feel bad about the quiet of night my knee is ok thanks for asking",
        "Good game, i just wish it has a pvp mode. Keep it up",
        "A very fun game has strategy elements which i love my only complaint is the mage, i dont do any damage and die very quickly"

I could simply get lost in my own little world- or should I say oasis- for a while so I can calm down. Also the little messages are very sweet, and I love the artstyle! All in all this is a fantastic game, I wholeheartedly love it. C:",
        "I like it a lot but I only wish I could turn off the SFX for tapping and leave the BGM and ambient noises (like rain from the weather and rain cloud) on. Other than that, the ads are subtle and unobtrusive, the bonuses reasonably helpful for the cost, and the shop is nice (but unnecessary! You can enjoy the game without it. )",
        "Ads, ads and more ads. Rated family friendly but ads include electric cigarettes and lottery. Not exactly family friendly. The game is based on tapping to gain hearts to buy things to gain more hearts. Neat except it's nearly impossible to avoid the ads, which seem to be nothing but electric cigarettes and lottery ads (more than 6/10). Even when you're trying to play without ads, you will inevitably tap one of those inspirational messages from one of the animals or plants and launch an ad.",
        "I really love the inspirational phrases that pop up randomly. It really changes my mood when I read one. The only thing is that I wish this could have a journal section. Where I could write thoughts down or a gratitude journal where you write 3 good things that happen today and you could double your hearts. It would help level up the land faster and for people that are using this as a pick me up app. It would help us put our thoughts down all in the same place. :)",
        "I've only been playing this game for about 30 minutes and I can already say this game is one I'll be playing for a long while. I have a job interview coming up and boy does this relieve my anxiety! The little bubbles of encouragement is a very nice touch! They make me feel warm and fuzzy.",

And addictive including this one it's fun and ever since the first play I've been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don't change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.",
        "Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don't have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!",
        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.",
        "THIS GAME IS RIGGED FOR YOU TO WIN. All you have to do is not die. I literally just played a game without rolling over any boosts and still won. The bots are programmed to let you win and just die before the end. This makes the game too easy and not fun to play."

I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Not for those who want a almost free game.  Of course the developers need to make money, but I think this game goes overboard.  In order to advance in the game at a rate that keeps you interested, you must pay.  Not very balanced."

I fully upgraded my first starter and reserve and now i have like 50000 in money and can't buy anything since it all requires gold not cash. If it was cash not gold i would give it 5 stars in an instant",
        "I am amending my original 5 star review. I am now giving this game 1 star due to the feature that claims to allow you to earn more gold. I tried a couple of different offers which involved \"a quick survey and email address\". This was complete BS. They were both endless loops of surveys and information mines, and never was given my promised reward after completing the initial survey. This is very dishonest and extremely annoying. So annoying that it prompted me to take the time to change my 5 star review to 1 star.",

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Good Naval Battle game.  Graphic is good. Aiming seem realistic. Team oriented.  Still need some adjustments( such as full salvo Battleship rounds hits can't even cripple a DD).  Missing some mechanism like ammo rack damage. But over all, it is a good game although not as balanced as PC version."

        "Purchased the full unlock for $7.99 and every time my daughter gets to the pinkie pie level at the crystal empire it freezes up at the same spot and she can't finish the game I want my money back.  Additionally, the purchase is supposed to remove ads yet once you exit a level an ad pops up again.",

        "Video adverts fill the screen every 5 second, and attempts to close them take you directly to the play store. Closing the play store then loads a demo of the advertised game. Then closing this reloads the my little pony game from the beginning so you lose all progress anyway. Totally unplayable and not acceptable to give to children, Budge should be asahmed of themselves! Disgraceful.",

        "This game would be a lot better if it showed how to win and gave an as you go tutorial. As it is it's just guessing and a shot in the dark. It literally took me half an hour plus 3 hints to get 3stars on a level.",
        "Gameplay was very good, if not ridiculous in rewarding you for cheaply built yet unstable structures....but whatever, that's a game mechanic that can be overlooked. What really turns me off to this game though are the push notifications. For one, why does a game like this even NEED push notifications. Secondly, to then make me unable to disable said feature is ridiculous. So 1 star out of sheer prinicple",
        "I remember playing an older version of this game called \"Bridge Constructor\" & I'm afraid this new version makes me feel nostalgic for the old one. The scoring system is purely financial (it used to consider how stable the bridge was as well). The game seems to want to get you to build the bridge how it wants you to build it. Creativity is discouraged.",
        "This really gets your brain working to solve these challenges. It could only get better with a sand box mode, but having the constraints of each scenario keeps you on your toes.",
        "Actually forces the player to engage some brain cells and memory banks. The practicle application of physics is a must with this game and you are essentially in awe of good ole Roman engineering.   As an educational application, this presents an excellent opportunity for individuals to learn the basics of civil engineering.  I sincerely applaud the developers.",
        "A good time waster.  Some control issues and limitations on building process which are not in similar games ... however a good concept for a puzzle/engineering game."

You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and – most of all – adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car. Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won't be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.You will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don't want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!In addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.The game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you've built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.Realistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don't let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!Game features:- Superb physics - a true simulator - Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds- State of the art realistic graphics- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won't get bored as you build - Spectacular special effects- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic - Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor - Built-in hint system helps you build your skill",

Need to be able to earn diamonds faster.  Even if you purchase diamonds the pricing is exorbitant.  Way out of line with other games. Update: don't waste your money to update to a better ball. It does no good and actually makes the game harder.",

For some reason everytime I try and Shoot To the Left it releases before I take my thumb off and completely screws up my shot. Does not seem to happen as much when shooting to the right side of the screen. Especially annoying when I have one block left in the warning Zone. The aiming is also an issue. Fix these issues and I will absolutely love this game.",

No intrusive, annoying ads that force you out of the gameplay, jyst a simple bar at tge top I was actually inckibed to look at because I FELT like giving sonething back because I was enjiying the game.

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

        "I love Snoopy! This is a great game. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star is because it runs slowly on my tablet. I do not have that many apps on my tablet that can inhibit the game's performance so not sure what the issue could be. Overall I do like this game!",

I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",

Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."

        "Way too much grind! Lower tier weapons become useless way too fast even if you level them up. If you want to progress through the waves all you need is to level up your legendary weapon! And to do that you need to either pay or watch a million ads",
        "Can u guys add more weapons and skills? Ill rate it 5 stars if u do. Great game tho (im pretty sure it will get boring so u guys should add more modes or features, otherwise it will gwt boring)",
        "The game is simple yet fun. There aren't way to many ads and if there are you can skip them after a few seconds. Also I like how you can watch ads to get crates or diamonds, and not a meesly amount. It could use a few more weapons. But overall fun game.",
        "I can skip ads but no one else can for some reason lol.But I put it down one star because when I'm watching a ad to get a vanity item it glitches and I can't finish it.And another one because I can't get double coins after the game.",
        "Rating 1 star for the use of non- optional 30 second ads with no way to skip that appear after a single game. Not ok guys, i won't be playing anything else by you.",
        "It's pretty great. I feel like there could be more to it though. Like new suits and skins for your character and weapons and more weapons. You're doing a great job though, keep it up"
