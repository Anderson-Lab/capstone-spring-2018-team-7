        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio.",
        "Great Game! Really captures that what made SIMS fun and for mobile on the go at that! Graphics are reasonable considering it is new. When building houses the only drawback is you cant construct walls within a room, you have to work with box rooms. As well as you cant make like a out door patio without it being in a room enclosure.  All in all though I do highly recommend this game to you if youve enjoyed SIMS games in the past. Loads to do,events and updates to keep you busy for awhile."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",
        "This should be called Army Men Drama Field... This Game is a Joke along with the consultants you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than getting a hold of anyone. And it's like being in pre school you can get banned for saying a bad word 🤣 i wouldnt waste my money or time on this game"

        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "Dear team, It's really a awesome game ever. I'm playing it since 2 years. Very addictive. But i request you to all, when we start a TEAM RACE many players join clans for playing team race n take efforts in team race for getting better reward but many of them team leaders kick players just before ending the team race n players won't receieve any reward for it. It was happened with me 2 times. So please do any update for those players who take much efforts in team war and then also they get nothing. Thanks",
        "This game used to be 5 star. They've changed it where all team events are gem sucks. You have no chance of winning without using a considerable amount of gems. They've taken away most in game free ways to get gems, and to buy them is not worth it, they're very over priced. It's not a team event, it's a paid for event. If they change it and make it more fair for everyone I'll make a new rating.",
        "It's a nice game with so many awesome monsters. I like it and it's my favourite game in this category. My suggestion is that if you can include an option to cancel ongoing breeding by giving gold or gems or without anything, it would have been better. The game has events that comes very frequently, it helps so much in getting new monsters and or progressing in the game.",
        "The game is awesome! The game play, the monsters, and also the actual fighting and graphics. This is one of my most rated games and my most played; I couldn't go a day without it. It's competition is so good online with people and in dungeons and the map, also team wars are fun with your friends. Get this game you'll never regret it.",
        "DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. Recently my account was reset due to the game posting the wrong price of gems. I have lost everything even the things I paid full price for. I have been robbed of gems, cells, gold, food and my time. If you do play the game, don't spend actual money because they can take it all away. BE CAREFUL"

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and addicting, with patience.  My only complaint is that everytime i die,  which is often,  i lose all my stuff and can never find my body again.  I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",
        "WARNING: every time you update the game, it cannot connect to your google play account for god knows how many hours or even days! The risk of losing all your progress is VERY high. If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",
        "I love the game. But seriously? You get 1 energy every 5 minutes and at minimum need 13 energy to get somewhere... Also why do you stop letting us watch ads? It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",
        "I'm done with this game... I have spent hours on it and despite being level 99 the game has stagnated. This latest update... Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",
        "check out my review from yesterday and their reply. for an investment you can develop faster, which means spend money. that's all you care about. I've been a loyal player from the very beginning and that's their response. I'll post a message on Facebook everyday and see how many people keep playing your game or even start playing it. lol. isn't it funny how they only have gameplay graphics and controls that you can see the rating for and not how happy users are. download war z law of survival. that game is much better and the developers actually listen to the people playing."

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",

        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

AND THEN WHEN THE NEW UPDATE COMES OUT.... I LOSE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you PLEASE give me the stuff back.",
        "This is my favorite game.I have played it since I was in P1 but the only things that I want Rilisoft to make are a 4th campaign world cause I have been waiting for almost 4 years and that you can give your friends weapons.But still great and memorable game so well done Rilisoft",
        "I like this game a lot. I don't know if I were think too much but I feel like Everytime I level up, the weapon that I use before was unexpectedly weaker.Lucky chest seem to drop only coins and crysrals(sometimes I got free spin). And some modes, weapons and armor balance is not really that balance (example:last match I used smart bullet bazooka to kill people using 4 rockets to kill them. But he killed me with only 2 rockets of smart bullet bazooka...... How is that even balance?!). I hope you fix this soon. Because I love to play game.",
        "This game is really good its just lots of items are so expensive can u lower that  besides that this app is so cute and kaoss at the same time love it keep up the good work😜🙌🙋🙌😋😝",
        "I love the new update thank you cubic games for adding back the double jump with the berserk boots you guys are awesome. I also love the new controls it feels much more comfortable for me so I really love that.  the new controls are very nice and it makes it a lot easier to play",
        "It's fun but it logs me out every once and a while in a game then I lose trophies but I like, also its hard to earn money"

It's definitely a must have for fans of this game type.",

That is just too much access to my phone. I did not even get a chance to play the game because it wanted that access on start up; it will not allow you to play the game without give permission.",
        "It's a great strategic game. PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it's a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team. Lots of ways to win free stuff and points you can spend on items needed in alliance store and keep up with your wallet warrior team mate. One downside is the support..they can be a little sliw in response time to problems. But they don't just ignore you either.",

You're still getting the permission from un-educated users that you can read their messages. That's very shady.",

It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "House Of Fun Slots is the Best Slot Game you will ever play and I  promise that you want to play this and once you give it a try you will never want to put it down. I deleted all the other slot  games because they  can't  compare to  this game.  If I  could  give it  more then  55️⃣  star's 🌟 I most  definitely would.",
        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm"

Either the makers of the game are idiots or the game is stupid and seriously 2000 per month for an imaginary egg everyday that cannot guarantee a 4 or 5 star bird. Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",
        "I did not expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I have. The frequent events are nice and having a guild just makes them better. I don't feel compelled to be social be because there is no chat, just playing the game. It is a wonderful balance.",
        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "Decent game, lots of fun to keep you coming back. I would of rated a 4 star game but every time I need to watch a video the game stops working, stopping me from getting a free premium egg or opening chests!"

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",

Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",

I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "Updates keep getting stuck with the ver 3.8.1. Since it was released. Download 269 out of 269 but nothing happens after that, and a message of \"connection error\" keeps appearing. Have passed the daily log in bonus, and will probably lose the consecutive login bonuses as a result. Didn't create transfer code or link to fb account yet so may risk of losing account if I reinstall. Please fix this asap.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star"

        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAİN that SYSTEM DİVİSİON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER DİVİSİON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is 👌 I love it",
        "This season I really put in a big effort to try and win the treble. Got the best players, do all the training, strategy ect. All for nothing. Lost against a crappy team in semi of Cup. Apparently according to IA it wasn't my day. Like I said before, game is pre programmed. Dev's do nothing about the gameplay, they rather concentrate on silly add ons which can make them money. Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs",
        "I think u guys should find a way for us(we the managers) to get tokens easier . I don't understand why winning the league or champions league only gets you money but no tokens . it really sucks"

Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "It's a nice game, with a great graphics and such but the auto-update for extra files it's kind of annoying. Is there anyway to turn it off? Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

I am a Diamond Star 4 and I feel as if the higher the level the higher the reward but, the rewards are all the same. When you work your way up you want to feel rewarded! If coin rewards increase in the higher levels so will my rating!!!!!",
        "I would give it 5 stars, but they've changed a few things. It's now more difficult to earn coins for power-ups. So in order to win the tournaments, they've put people in the position of having to make purchases more often. Needless to say, I don't play as often anymore. I've also noticed that several of my friends don't play anymore either. Too bad, the game used to be a lot more fun.",
        "Been playing this game for years. Loved it in the beginning.  Seems the lower I rate the game as they try to make easier for people that are not good.  the birds I throw are nearly useless a lot of times compared to playing the same game for a star 2 player I know. And now the game is crashing constantly. Wish I could sell the nearly 100,000 bird coins I have. Seems I won't need them.",
        "Ok so when there is an issue that needs addressed, sometimes it take a couple of days for the tech people to get to it. But overall the game is awesome! This is the only game that I still play every day from the time I got a smart phone, which has been several years!",
        "I love playing angry birds friends. I'm an adult woman and have played since they came out with the game. Scoring in first place many times. Recently there seems to be too much graphics and sometimes using plays from other games or other angry birds games. If people are submitting what they have thought out, please make sure it stays within original angry birds friends game. Some levels are too far out there.",
        "I loved this game to keep in touch with a few friends but please take those stupid Dignity ads off... They do not close and always end up missing up my game. I have to close the game out and start all over. Loosing many power ups and coins in this tedius game making it more frustrating than fun."

Would keep people playing more and they would have more purchases! That's how I'd rack in the bucks if it were my app!",

Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",
        "I like this game but it's frustrating how it's hard to get stars and then they want you to waste them on things like giving the cat a bath... I want to decorate the house not do all the silly side things."

Unfortunately, i have one issue i can't access the chat room, no messages, cant access mh own profile. It keeps saying network error even though i am currently playing the game smoothly. If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",
        "If you put gold army in your garrison troops its impossible to invade you even the attacker is highest level. Attacking castle is very costly you need to attack many times for few resources. The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",
        "I think I would like this game but somehow I have never played it or downloaded it until today but the game is not at the beginning and I keep getting kicked off as it says I have logged into another device.  Not the first time I have ran into this problem.  Please help me fix this.  I have cleared the game data uninstalled and all that nonsense.",

Some of my favorites are in the  classic section. I have been playing for several years. Today I am upset because of deleted chips, went from 1.2m won 690k but they did a minus instead of add. Grrrrrr  😊 Today my chips are multiplied, I'm doing great. It's a fun game.",

The graphics are good,  the bonuses are good and the tier rewards are the best!!  The social aspects are really good plus you get rewards for/and from friends.  The only thing I would change is the ability to give gold.",

BFC ONLY CARES ABOUT TAKING MONEY FROM PEOPLE WHILE RIGGING THE SYSTEM AMONGST OTHER UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR. GOOGLE PLAY SHOULD BAN THIS SCAM APP."

I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",

I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "Not a bad game but it's typical like some other games. It starts off with the levels being super easy, letting you build your confidence to get you thinking you're really good.  Now I understand the higher the levels the more difficulty there is but not to the point where they make it almost impossible trying to get you to buy more chances. Another words they're trying to get you to pay to win and advance not necessarily on skill level. Very sneaky. Uninstalling. It's fun for a while but overall I do not recommend.",
        "Love this game, but it freezes up. I go to try and reinstall it after a few days but it won't let me reinstall the game. Just stays at the same  level last completed. Still having the problem of when having to reinstall I lose all my lives and charms. Love the game but hate ,owing all my lives and charms",
        "I love this game but damn, why does the videos seem to always freeze up. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good game and all, so why don't you guys just fix the glitches. Thank you🤔",
        "The update took me from level 400 back to level 1 very upset be first I wasn't getting my daily play rewards so I figured like everything else it may need to update and the update blow my whole progress. I'm so pissed is there a way to fix this?",
        "I actually enjoyed the game and would give it four or five stars except 200 coins and multiple items were taking away simply because I got logged out if Facebook. Also several levels were lost.... This I understand, glitches happen. What I don't understand and don't accept is the lack of response from the developer. I've sent several emails and have yet to get a non automated response.",
        "I installed the game about 3 times and gave up. Can't connect with Facebook and when playing it suddenly stop and say it's not responding."

        "Overall game is very good n addictive, been playing the game for awhile now. 1 major issue of the game is bugs that cause the game to lag esspecially after every game update. Reali hope Pocket Gems will look into this matter seriously and build a better game foundation. I will review my ratings when the game is more stable.",
        "LOVE THIS GAME!! unlike other timed games you don't have to wait around.  When things are upgrading you can literally spend hours if you want just attacking other bases and breeding dragons.  Graphics are amazing and this is one game that constantly has me coming back.",
        "Wonderful game, all these pay to win comments are slightly misleading. There are several power ups and time reducers that come fairly easy if you participate in events. Which, the events are almost always going on so you don't get bored!  Only problem I have is that the app keeps uninstalling itself from my phone. Not sure if it's the app's fault or my phone, but it doesn't happen to any other app on my phone...",
        "PG needs to fix a lot of stuff. They never listen to the community and with the Atlas update has destroyed many alliances by creating a class divide between teams of all ranks. Huge let down and am afraid of the future of the game when game design decisions like this are allowed to occur.",
        "Fun until you have to wait a day to do something. How can you play a game if the game won't let you play, but by good it takes up space. So you want me to have a game taking up space in my phone but I'm can't play the game. So it is literally a waste of space.. developers are stupid and selfish."

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned",
        "Not only are the graphics realistic, there so persise on everything. They even allow you to purchase different variety of guns. I just wish they let you assemble your own gun, which of course accessories. Best sniper game I've ever played."

        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "Supposed random game is not random. You only win the lowest prices until you start spending gold.  Black market is the same. Also it will take you a decade before you get the best robots unless you shell out your hard earned money. I hope the drop off scheme would earn me points, however it's just for one type of robot.",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard"

EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "the new fusion medals added make it so you can not fuse heros without spending money this game is officially broken theres no free way to advance anymore dont download. its very sad i like the idea behind the medals but whos going to grind with 0 progress for 8 months and still not get thier first 6 star .... its messed up",
        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "I just bought a golden crate for 100 golds, only to get a muscle ECU uncommon part. Disappointing,  no blue prints. Even in a free crate you get blue prints.  Frustrating the reward system is horrible. Am never going to buy any golden crate. Players should be given choices to buy golden crate but you get trusted upon with useless worthless part. Otherwise good game",
        "The game is pretty good, being a free mobile game, it is not trying to hide it's PTW features, but you can do mostly everything without having to spend a penny. One suggestion I think needs to be put in place is a confirmation window when you go to skip a level, because I was doing the speedhunter event for the Mazda MX-5, and accidentally hit the skip race button and lost a lot of gold, maybe not letting me even get the upgraded car now."

        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

        "First off to all those saying too many ads, there aren't any ads. What you're seeing is game packs that can be purchased to help you advance within the game. I love the game. Everythingis great. I just wish they would give everyone time to adjust to previous items before creating something new. And also the pricingis too high. $20-$50 is fine but $99 is way too much.",
        "This game has become a cash cow for the developers at MZ. New features are added making the game more complex and diverse weekly. Costing players money. While old features players are familiar with and depend on break down  After contacting MZ you get a nice form letter stating thank you for bringing it to there attention but they hope you understand these things take time to fix.",
        "This game should be awesome, but the updates just come too fast now. I bought 2 packs this week and still got zeroed as soon as i dropped shield. By the time you spend 2 days clicking upgrades, someone is stronger than you and just waiting for you to try to use your new stuff.",
        "This game was fun about two years ago before MZ started trying to milk players each month for money.  If you buy a package from them,  which ranges from $14.99 to $399.99, make sure you get what you pay for. ..many times you don't get everything they promise; especially with the BOGO packages.   MZ will do little if anything to correct the matter.  Also, even after you spend tons of money, if you wait long enough they will give you the same stuff for free to all players.   My advice...find another game to play. ..something more fun and worthwhile. ..and not sponsored by MZ.",
        "If you want to be at top of this game then be prepared to spend more than the price of a top end BMW in one year. I am not kidding. MZ releases major game changing upgrades every day for several $99.99 packs. Then you get tge worst customer support in the industry. Terrible software quality control and business practices that mirror drug cartels.",
        "Mz took a once decent game and ruined it.  The weekly changes are senseless change is to be gradual.  Im finally walking away.  Im done with ur bots, done with admin accts and done with daily chances.  More and more people have quit and droves more will follow.  Choke on the money u got from all  of the foolish people who actually paid.  You deserve none of it"

        "I think this game has very good everything, the only thing about the game play is that they trick you kind of and it is hard to get Easter Eggs and stuff. Or when you jump off a train and there is one of those things you have to roll under but you have no time so the police catches you. Or maybe I am not good with those things. Yeah, probably just I am not good at this game.",
        "Why is it difficult to get daily challenge without using data?  And one can't see other users scores without data. Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",
        "It's amazing game but I miss the mystery boxes collecting while running can u plz update in next version. Not  getting daily words and rewards after using net also. The game is not upto the mark. I will remove the game if problem is not resolved.",
        "Great game. Only thing is that I haven't seen Ireland or Dublin come up yet. Been playing for a few years now",
        "This game is BRILLIANT! But quite difficult. Sometimes I try and slide but instead I roll????? Maybe if the controls were less sensitive???? Also, jackpot I never ever get. I really want the teleporter but I can't get enough coins and I've been playing for AGES! Otherwise, brilliant game always fun. Time consuming.Thank you!"

However, the game is not balanced for casual players and the development put a huge emphasis on pay to play. If you want to climb you really have to give up your life and keep climbing, and pay so you can simply redo your skills as you gain more. Hard to justify committing so much time.",

        "Nice Game! At the start its easy, like many players said, but maybe they didnt stick through to further their games,I believe the easy start is needed to build for the later part of the games specially if you are a f2p player. Though being F2P isnt as bad here as it is on other games (speaking from experience). I like thier new updates now and specially the \"sweep\" requirement. Thanks Devs! my only hope is that please make planting/ crops a little easier on us common folks,it gets a little bit tiring to have to press from seed&gt;plant repeat (depending on your available field). Anyway, besides this i do not regret playing the game, easy controls, f2p friendly, graphics is good, controls are good. Keep up the good work devs!looking forward to more updates",
        "For the love of God let me grammar check your game...",
        "Very nice and addictive game, i like it.  Would be nicer if pvp is already availble",
        "Nice game. I just hope more free diamonds to be given during quests :)",
        "I love the game but what happened to pk cus you guys are an different company",
        "Downloaded the game just to see LoL heroes like Ahri and Sona on action only to found out most of them in preview screenshots doesn't exist in-game. But overall a fun game and f2p friendly.  Edit: upped my rating to 5 after 5 days playing, you guys deserve it. Keep up the good work. :)"

        "I have played this game for years now. Great new levels, still challenging, and fun ways to earn power-ups without having to make a purchase! Loved it until it quit working on my phone. Doesn't even crash anymore, just quits mid-play and I lose whatever progress I'd made. I play when I can on my tablet, but it's just not the same. I don't know why it won't work on my phone without spontaneously closing! 5 stars if it did...",
        "I love, love  this game is difficult to play, but to my opinion is the best game on line ihave been playing for 2 years and my goal is to beat it . you get rewards. I spend money but with the rewards you get something back  ,also I just started another game with is similar like pandapop and iam a also give it 5 stars . even that iam a grandmother of 72 years old. I still popping. !!",
        "A wonderful game to have very fun and exciting install right away you won't regret it. I've reached level 1049. It is super exciting to me learning how to Ricochet the balls off the walls. The projection of the angle need it. This is my all-time favorite and I highly recommend it to my friends and family. Plus, the little bit of flaws and the enemies within the game, will have you taking a break and coming back for more. Just know that I've deleted this game twice but always came back to it because this game , is fun and challenging .  If you don't like a challenge you won't like this game .  Just so you know , it does not require internet, to be able to play this game like others. Technicians please put out more games that don't need the Internet to play. This game is one of them. Just know that option is super helpful. We need more games able to be played without internet intervention. Ty taking time to read this. Have fun a Poppin. LOL",
        "Not bad, not great. Randomly stops in the middle of play and you lose a life. Also takes a long time to load and to move to the next level. Okay for free, but if I paid for it I would be asking four a refund.  Update: I've contacted the developers multiple times. They keep sending the same canned response.  Game crashes frequently. Frustrating when you are just about to finish a level. Uninstalling.",
        "I use to give this a 5 star rating until I lost all of my panda belt progress when I updated, 5 days ago. I sent a report to you and got a message that said there was a problem with the update. I'm still waiting for an answer on when this will be fixed. I refuse to play any levels or specisls, like badboon lair until I can receive the panda belt credits. If I don't receive the panda belt credits or if I am not credited for the points that I lost I will uninstall this game!!!!!",
        "I loved this game and have played it for a few years now. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the last few months, it just closes on me mid play and I lose on my progress, as well as any items and special powers that I used to advance in a level. Very frustrating to lose items and have to start all over on the level."

        "I got this game about a month after it was released.  Everything was awesome, the support was phenomenal and worked well together fixing bugs and listening to players.  They have done many great things, but the support more on non existent except for those who put thousands into the game.  I've dropped about $600 and the ignore my mails, msging via messenger.  Fun game, support is AWFUL",
        "The trailer ad for this game shamelessly plays Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack, and graphical assets in the actual game are similarly copied from other people's work. And by that I mean not influenced, by but blatantly ripped off. Hellooo lawsuit...",
        "Developer has long history of poorly coded apps with server stability issues as well as loss of purchased game credits and lack of proper support.  Pick a game by a developer who actually SUPPORTS their app instead, you'll be much happier.",
        "It was Great, until the stupid game started crashing every day!  I spent cash on this, and to lose so much due to it glitching and crashing is unacceptable!  I'll give more stars when this issue is fixed... until then if you don't wanna lose your money die to crashes and glitches DO NOT INSTALL!   Update , I wish I could give negative Stars,  it is continuously CRASHING if my troops die due to FAILURE which is caused by the developers faulty upkeep this time, I'll quit and never play another game made by this company again!  SIMPLY FIX THE ISSUES ON YOUR GAME OR REDUND OUR MONEY, YA CROOKS!!!!!!😠😠😠😠😡",
        "Game was great. But now has to many glitches. Hopefully you don't have a problem because the support team is non existent. They never get back to you when you email them. I personally have list alot of troops because of glitches. 1 month ago I would have said download this game but I wouldn't now untill they fix the glitches.",
        "customer service is a joke. hard to find a game where owner/developer cares about their players that spend $500 to keep their servers running. player community great. rest sucks. I deleted this app after crashing almost everyday for a week"

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

But, there's not enough energy or chances to win energy or earn it. 10 isnt enough!There's times when I'm out of energy and have done everything I can do and have to leave the game but still feel like playing. I've spent money on this game but I don't always have money to buy energy or coins to buy energy. There should be more give-a-ways, prizes, little games, etc to earn more energy so I can keep playing!! Also, I'd like to be able to friend request other players and send them things. Like people on my team on here.  Thank you! Lynn Mauger",

        "Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Good game but......after a day into it you make no coin. After every level upgrade it pushes the (buy) equipment option. Not to mention every time you level up. You got to.exit out 15 boxes.before you can continue. Good game but, it's a failure on the free to play aspect.  My rating is fair and final. It's a (ok)  game but many better ones out thwre",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",
        "Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s"

Your replies seem to be automated with certain words triggering certain responses. Sort your stuff out people, get your house in order and give us what we deserve. Our legendary bonnet head. I will be uninstalling if you don't come around",
        "Fun game. Good graphics, and overall good fishing simulator. However, its ridiculously rigged. I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",

I have to be at work at 6:00am. Download this game now! Thank you for making an AMAZING fishing game. Hats off to the creater's",
        "This game is great and what it does, massive castles sprawling battles across the ages with wizards on dragons back firing missiles at unicorns below... Erm it's fishing they lured me in and I'm hooked, what else is there to say. Great game.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "It would be better if they offered more free chips. Rather than bombarding us Every time we log in with there outrageous prices. Also a flush draw Every other hand and usually someone hits. Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done."

        "I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I have to say, I didn't have high hopes when I started. 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop and I wanted to play more. It's a different take on a Final Fantasy game, and it really does feel like a Dissidia game in RPG form. The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

        "Im usually quite picky when it comes to game and this game nailed it. I don't have much time for game and this seems to be the perfect game for me to pass time and no need to overly commit. The game play is pretty creative and if you really think through it, there's really a lot of depth. Also, the developer is not as greedy as other games, e.g. gems and enchant remain even if you change gear etc. In another games, they could easily force you to spend $ to buy protection. Overall a great game thus far.",
        "Edit: I cant login to game, it force closes at 80%.   Game is good, but never had I played a game that very much lacks game info/help details. Like what the hell are pet skills for? And no details on what those skills do. What the hell is pet polish? What is pet transformation? How are runes used? It totally lacks game guides/info and you have to figure out stuffs on your own. Good game, lacks substance. Im already playing for two months and i still dont know a lot of stuffs. Wow.",
        "The game is pay to win(to tell you the truth). But if you are free 2 play player absolutely it will take time and they put some limitation for free gamer, but actually it is a fun and cute game a good game to try. And actually I already spent money here so I am a VIP user. Good game to invest but its so expensive. Hahaha",
        "Hmm, I am a fan of idle games because it doesnt cosume a lot of time and you can play idle for mobs. Tho.. this game kinda hard to level up and requires diamond to level up faster. You cant gain a level for just an hour.. it seems it needs to take a day, just to level up. Kinda sucks for me. But if you dont want to wait a day for 1 level just buy a lot of diamonds and you will reach level 100 in just a few minutes.",
        "I love it especially how I haven't played RO for years. It's very simple and does not consume a lot of time to play. However it lack of items and varieties of things unless you're a cash player. (not much either) EDIT : can the problem where daily quest can't be claim be fixed? Usually it's the send friend a gift quest where I have to restart the game in order to claim it. Sometimes it's the gift box(honor)",
        "Signed up with an XD account I made when starting the game. Loved it day 1, so bought premium, and enjoyed that for ~0.5 days. Second day go to sign in, the password I used that it saves no longer works. I cannot log in and have emailed support multiple times with account info, transaction info, etc, and no response. Practically theft - paid for 90 day VIP and cannot access account and company provides 0 support. 0 stars."

        "Played this game for about 2 years.  Used to be great until the terrible ucool made it completely pay to win.  They have unbalanced and just add new heroes for $100 a month, ridiculous.  Terrible company that only cares about money, for your sake, find a different game.",

Do not blame the devs for your impatience or inability to see the strategy in the game. This game can be completely F2P if you have patience. I do no blame the devs for wanting to get paid for releasing a quality product. Paying for the little boosts here and there give you an edge but give it a month and then the new characters are available through several different means. Keep up the good work!!!"

        "This game is amazing! But enemy units keep getting stuck behind walls Also there are a few enemy lands that are not responding when you tap on them. This didnt happen before.  I think updating attack list would be good. So you could see who you have attacked, not just who attck you. Just  a thought",

The commands are also touchy and the battle displays for viewing if kinda difficult to  keep up with. But it's fun and a little bit addictive.",
        "Amazing graphic but really poor gameplay... Even lowest level, it's hard to complete easy campaign. Every win need to paid. Useless to raid... Uninteresting how the mission needed to complete... Disliked this game bcoz of the poor gameplay and the way of how to complete the mission.",
        "Ive been playing this game a very long time now. definitly a 5 star game in every aspect. only issue is.. i spend money on this last event.. 3 raids left to get 14k reward for the 4 star poison ranger.. the bloody game hang again..manage to log back only when the event was over..!!! Now i have this 2 useless relics taunting me.. Almost felt like deleting the game..",

If you have low self-esteem, stay away, experience gamers will tear you a new one repeated, makes progressing to new lvls  slow."

        "If you like base building war strategy games then please download this app. It's an game that has constantly going back. Although you have many in app purchases available you can play without spending any real money and be competitive. The developers award you with more than enough items on a daily basis. It's definitely a must have for fans of this game type.",
        "I'm sure this is a fun game, however I do not see the reason why it needs to have permission to manage my phone calls or know my location if I never plan to use any online abilities. That is just too much access to my phone. I did not even get a chance to play the game because it wanted that access on start up; it will not allow you to play the game without give permission.",
        "It's a great strategic game. PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it's a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team. Lots of ways to win free stuff and points you can spend on items needed in alliance store and keep up with your wallet warrior team mate. One downside is the support..they can be a little sliw in response time to problems. But they don't just ignore you either.",
        "Why does this app request access to make calls/read sms/messages? Un-installed right away.  Edit: That's not how it works. Just because you say \"your phone is safe\" doesn't make it safe. You're still getting the permission from un-educated users that you can read their messages. That's very shady.",
        "it was a good game but after playing it a month the server has errors. I lost 50% of my troops in my main castle which went missing, lost 1 m of power, my farms was plundered and troops in my farms was massacred. Reported the issue but they ROK did not bother to give me a courtesy reply so if you decide to play but sure the system does not steal your time and effort playing the game.  Plus the added frustration"

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",

        "Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "The game itself is fabulous. Cute farm. Good graphics. Good work on that front. Yet being a bit more generous with westbucks in game or making some things more payable with your coins. I get that games don't create themself. But I personally am more likely to pay for games you can actually play for a bit after doing a purchase. And I don't really get that feeling here. But none the less the game itself is a work of art 😊"

It's challenging, addictive and beautifully developed both visually and audibly.My complaints would be:   *Certain aspects of the game are not clear, with nowhere to reference. So certain occurrences just seem incidental and therefore don't allow you to fully strategize.   *There are no written rules or explanations to refer to. Additionslly, the game is not customizable. I was just assigned a random avatar (which I don't like) which doesn't appear adjustable.  *It also used my real name to identify in the game, even though I had already created one before registering to King Games. Worse, there seems to be no way to change this either.  If there is a way already developed to address these issues, please help!",

You'll be in s timed level and you lose time because you can't see under the words.  Some levels its ridiculous to have to do them 15 times to pass it",
        "I think there is difference between hard to solve or impossible. To get diamonds in order you should be able to get them. As example. Need to get circle first then triangle. But you cant get triangle unless circle is moved first. And mission failed because you didnt get diamonds in order. This is repeats over and over again. This is impossible to solve. I even had to deal with triangle being right down at the bottom. And all other diamonds at the top. I failed of cause. I am giving my view because I fed up with this stupid idea.",
        "I really love this game. But expeditions are more fun then the game itself. I really wish we could actually finish the expeditions instead , of not getting to finish the story behind them. Also during the expeditions to buy things are way to expensive because the amount of maic it takes to remove one item. Pls address these issuea. Really hope to see some expeditions we can really have fun and finish with.",
        "I love the expedition part but not enough time to complete them. Also i cut one tree down and have to wait an hour to cut another. Its takes to much magic to clear paths.Its hard to build the bridges and stuff because of this. Other then that i have no problem with it.",
        "Love the different puzzle styles that go along with the basic mahjong matching game. It gives an extra challenge to completing each game. Sadly I have only gotten to 250 levels after a year or 2 of playing because the puzzles are constantly rigged to lose. I am not a cash player as I have more important living expenses to spend money on so buying power ups and such are not an option for me. Would be great if there weren't so many losing games one after the other. I'm referring to the ones where you get to the last couple of tiles and the gems needed are at the very bottom so you are made to match the 4th set of gems when you are supposed to match the 3rd set first. I get multiple games where the matching tiles are stacked on top of each other so it requires a shuffle to win. As I said I am not and refuse to cash shop on a game that is not worth spending money as it is not a necessity so it would be nice to be able to progress without 10-15 losing games in a row. The spinning wheel doesn't always have ads available and I rarely get power ups from it. I mainly get paws.",
        "Game updated now havent a clue what i need on level 421 and objects i need are blank boxes can play game but dont know what i need if any one can tell me object amount and what levels they are on it would be a help. Also have uninstalled game a installed it again but still dosnt help."

        "Wish the hearts were half price and that I could replay episodes without paying a new ticket. I've spent an embarrassing amount of money, about 900usd and counting. The overall quality of the stories is good. The variety of characters is good, but it would be nice to have more than one female love intrest per story. Go Persephone! 😻😚💘",
        "This is great! The best romance game I've come across. Only thing is maybe more female love interests and definitely have a system that gives you like 5 hearts a day? Just to get those back because I haven't played the game in a week and a half because of no hearts.",
        "Hearts are too expensive and the hearts needed for some choices are way too high. Daily loggin rewards don't have a good enough chance to get them either. Stories are great and I enjoy them very much. Would recommend for others even those who don't want to spend the money. I myself haven't paid a cent because of the high prices.",
        "I really enjoyed reading different stories. Loving this apps.Just please add more tickets... and also it takes forever to waitq for the next season or episodes..it spoils my excitement.. please don't make us wait .. your stories are all really good..just make it more fast in adding new season or episode please please please",
        "I've been playing the game for a really long time now since I was 13 or 14 and am now 17 turning 18 this year and I'm sooooo happy with how it's grown but the one issue I have is the hearts thing. I can't pay the specific amount to get a whole stash of heart and it really bugs me because I love the options that you give us but I don't have hearts...can you please look into it and come up withe something ?",
        "This game is addicting and is very fun I think you will love it.I did so try it out and see what happens.The one I loved the most was gangster love ash so I advise you to try that one out if you want.Also with the gangster love series try out chance he's fun"

Also, when making moves the move I make is not the move that happens. Also, when watching the video for the xtra coin: when the video ends the game restarts taking me back to tohome screen to press play to enter back into the game.. Thank you loyal player!!",
        "The sound effects of the tornado is kind of frightening but I don't fear because all the characters are near as I ease on down the road. The characters interactions will assist if I follow the yellow brick road. \"I can't wait to meet the wizard\" I believe I'm going to be granted more golden bricks to extend the yellow brick road. I'm curious like a lion. Lol. The best for the whole family. Thanks!",
        "This is by far the greatest game that I've ever played! A lot of my friends play as well, so I  can enjoy playing for a long time. Caution: Very addictive game!!! I find it hard to stop playing once I start. This is one app that you're going to want to download if you want to have some fun.",
        "I use to enjoy playing this game.  Lately though, there are less power ups to achieve and more of the movie tickets.  I would rather have the power ups than the tickets.  This is why I am changing the rating I previously gave of 5 stars to 3.  Also, you should really have more of the Glenda versus the Wicked Witch challenges.",
        "Great game but I really wish that daily rewards are better. It used to be you would get a crystal ball often, money and other things that to help with game, but lately it has been stuoid little rewards like two coins or one row clear. What happened to good rewards for players that come on every day and expect to get a little help in the game play",
        "I love this game except for ONE big aggravation.   When you win extended life you don't get to choose when to use it.  It starts immediately and sometimes you've been playing to complete a sprint or another section and you CANT play another two hours.   That means you lose that extra time.   Today I've lost a 3 hour extra play and now I'm about to lose another 2 hour play.   Very Annoying!"

        "Absolutely sublime! This game is so awesome it's exactly what I want in a dragon game! Although there are microtransactions, you can absolutely play this game without spending a cent to progress! I have never ever payed real money to purchase gold, food and all other resources and I've played this game for almost two years The two tips are a little bit of patience and to keep on breeding. Even if you've already bred a certain pair of dragons, selling unwanted eggs is the best and quickest way to make gold",
        "Once you get to level 100, breeding a dragon is almost impossible to nil. Very frustrating. My roommate and I started this game the same time. I am level 115 and she is on 83. We will breed the same dragons at the same time, she will succeed 85% of the time on the first try, it will take me over 10 times if I even get it, this started after level 100. Good luck long term players.",
        "The events are annoying. I have reached the max on collecting eggs. I just gather then from doing tasks. Does that mean I can't participate anymore and am just stuck. I don't understand. Why would you limit the gathering of items?",
        "Have been playing this game for a couple of years now and I love it! Sometimes it's frustrating - especially when you'd need to buy something to be able to get all the prizes during events - but it just makes it more challenging.  VERY happy with the customer support. I had an issue with a gift not being added to my totals, so I emailed them and they fixed it without issue.",
        "The game is definitely addicting. But when I went into the Egg-straordinary Egg hunt island and tapped on a activty, it said their was a wonky spell and it completely stopped the whole game. I've tried different things different times, and it still won't work. I have played this in the past and the same exact thing happened, but with something different.",
        "This game is AWSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOme. I had 1023 gems saved up and then it glitched and now I only have 34. I love this game so much! Please help me get my 984 gems back! I don't want to rate it lower than 5 stars, but this has happened twice now...😟"

        "This is a great game. It's fun, addictive, and a great time killer. The only problem I see is that I created an account on the game thinking it would save. WRONG! I had to do a factory reset on my phone and now I have to start over. I was so far with some really good cards, but alas I know more about the game now, so maybe I'll get there quicker this time.",
        "Don't bother downloading this game.  The customer service in this game is terrible.  I submitted a ticket because several combinations i researched in game disappeared.  I got a response that the game would fix itself and my ticket was being closed.  The problem didn't fix itself and i can't remember every combo lost. I submitted another ticket and I'm waiting for a response but after how my first ticket was handled I'm not confident they'll fix it. I've only been playing a few days but if the game is this buggy already then i don't recommend downloading it.",
        "It's actually surprisingly fun. The card mechanics are simple to grasp but with a enough depth to keep you trying new decks and combos. I chuckled a few times at some of the dialouge between the characters. 10/10 would recommend",
        "The game is addictive, but in short it's a gamble for cards. The prices are a lot for what you are getting. Lots of repetitive challenges. Unfortunately the quest for cards is really a quest for your wallet. I played since 9/16 and decided to walk away. Unfortunately you get to a point where the only way to move up is to spend, spend, spend. The gambling pulls for cards on real money game currency got old.",
        "The main problem with the game in my opinion is being able to attack your opponent while they have other cards in play. Perhaps if you could choose to block rather than be forced to take it the game would be a bit better aa youd have to manage your resources a bit better rather than beat hard until its over. Aside from that it is a very fun game to play",
        "Waste of money. No matter what you spend you never get decent cards. They stack the odds so no matter how you buy cards you'll always get ripped off. Mom's box is supposedly random yet I've bought hundreds of boxes I've never got anything worth a damn. I've played over a year and wasted a hundred bucks on this game w no reward. I strongly recommend you don't spend a dollar on this game. It won't help. The game will still screw you. Money will not help on this game."

Most of time it do not tough matter under all the clothes. I would have just wanted long white beard or something. Maybe later there is change for that too? I am still just on level 12.",

I end up having to close the game and never get to see it, then I go into the next Chapter not really knowing what's going on. The story is important to me and it's very unfortunate that this is happening. A fix from the developers or a suggestion on something I can do would be greatly appreciated.",

Servers open about twice a week. Merge happens about every 2 weeks. Unless you plan on spending minimum 100$ US. Expect to be at the bottom of the barrel.",
        "Game is a rip off and there only worried about getting your money while major bugs and issues are all over. You try to inform them about these issues and noticed from several other players with same issues but they seem to not care or attempt to get back to you. If you search Facebook page you will see there replies to various players are just a bunch of emojis showing that they are just a bunch of immature people. Definitely do your research on this game before downloading. I don't want anyone else making the same mistake I made with this game.",

Oh LOOK A FEW SECONDS INTO THE GAME YOUR KICKIN OFF WITH FULL NUDITY PEOPLE FULL NUDITY WHAT A WASTE OF MY SPACE. Beep* uninstall NEVER INSTALLING FROM YOU IDIOTS AGAIN You STUPID RIPOFF OF EA Games. I MEAN WHO NAMES THEIR COMPANY GAME EA. Worst game EVER",
        "Well if you like games that play them selves then this game is for you. 2 stars are for graphics and storytelling in game. I would rather play old Diablo 1 than this game, you have almost no control in game, everything is auto! Auto walk, auto battle, auto sell, auto quest, auto feed pet. The only thing that breaks auto-play is messaging other players and talking to npc. Just make the game a movie its more than halfway there.",
        "Good game. can't say ive experienced the problems other players have pointed out thus far. It is crowded with lots of players but you're free to roam at your own pace. Automation in an MMO is silly but I don't mind. I also was kind of expecting Dark Souls not WoW as the aesthetic and tone. I suppose my advise would be just add more classes, more stuff to do, and encourage actual interaction with environment and players. But not a bad game all in all",
        "Not good if you want to play this game, there's always people trying to kill you if you interact with players with red on their name. Im trying to level up my character and some random people keep killing my character, you can't have a personal space while you trying to level up, I'm warning you, don't be decieved by the flashy trailer they'll do any for your wallet"

After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",

I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",

I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",

Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",

        "I loved the game when I played the beta. Turn based rpg with different parables within the story mode. Unique unit designs. I cant get very far with the game because the audio echoes itself to the point where its almost hard to understand what is happening. Its a good thing there is subtitles. The game prides itself on its audio aspect by recommending \"use earphones for best experience\" before starting, and I would really love to hear the game.",
        "I used to love this game hence  I moved to the English server... having played on the Chinese server, I noticed the drop rate for this server is super low. Also the packages in the game ate way overpriced. Some skins in the Chinese server are free (ie moonlight blossom yuki onna) whereas in NA server you have to pay to get it. Honestly if the playing field is equal between the NA and the Asia server were equal, I'll stay in the NA server. Right now I'm going to move back to the Asia server even tho I can barely read the story.",
        "I love absolutely everything about this game. Its perfect...accept for one very big detail. Sadly, the characters that have unique and strategic skills are amazingly fun but will never amount to anything in pvp. The good characters are all too easy to play with and it becomes dull due to the lack of thought it takes to win. PVP is a disaster in gameplay and matchmaking. Otherwise, this game is very good.",
        "It's a beautifully made game with a good story line involved. Sure it can be pay to win and all that, but nothing that a bit of hard work can't catch up to.  The controls are easy enough to understand and the combat system is just as simple. It does offer a few unique things such as the shared resource for bigger and better attacks, but it only adds to the depth of the combat system. All in all it's a good game and well thought out.",
        "i really liked the game it has everything to be best game. But dont be soo greedy. please make some more events and make some balance in duel or whatever because of course i cant win against someone like 45lvl when I'm 30 no? And the summoning rate is low mystery amulets are only one for a week lol i think it will take 10 years to get ssr for me. I dont want to leave this game please make something thanks you.",
        "It's a fantastic game. It would be nice to lock actions so when you're on auto you don't waste orbs. You can pay alot to get more summons but it's all about grinding out the materials and taking the time to level up the guys you want. Would recommend for anyone who loves a good farm/grind game."

        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

        "I think that this game is amazing and soo fun and adicting but the only problem that I would have rated it 4 stars is that this game only works with internet connection which saddens me because this game is my absolute fav. game I have played and I always want to play it. Keep up the amazing(A+) effort!",

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",

Edit- ok I'm in again, but I'm still mad, but relieved I didn't throw away my money. OTHER games send a apology message than an update is being performed or something. But as a game it is fun & strategic",

Look at how Clash Royale has their setup. Your already  trying to mimic their game. You should study their gameplay more and use it for improvements. Just saying. Make a change in that 4hr wait.",
        "Since the new update, major loading issues. Game just freezes on the title screen. I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the PVP battles not being fair, but they usually within reason. My main complaint is THE HACKERS WHO DRIVE ME TO THE POINT OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. This game has great potential, it just needs the major issues addressed.",

        "Too many hackers since the beginning of the BFU!!! Too many are using a computer hack to play and cause energy speed ups. It causes the game to lag. Then I loose with an connection error or they just over power me with too many units on the field. Its ridiculous. I will change review when issues with them are fixed.   Now with one day to get to legendary tje game crashed...pathetic. Wish i could give a lower rating",
        "Would love to give 5 stars but I cannot even play. I downloaded, then went to play and got as far as the \"logging on\" page before the game said \"error no network connection\" when I clearly am connected.  EDIT : the issue has been resolved. Changed my rating to 5 stars as promised"

        "Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "The game itself is fabulous. Cute farm. Good graphics. Good work on that front. Yet being a bit more generous with westbucks in game or making some things more payable with your coins. I get that games don't create themself. But I personally am more likely to pay for games you can actually play for a bit after doing a purchase. And I don't really get that feeling here. But none the less the game itself is a work of art 😊"

Spinner is rigged so don't play if you actually want to be the very best there ever was because the computer will not let you.

All in all a great game for an mmo. The only drawback Ive found is the game tends to crash alot when its pushed to hard.",

Logged back in with my fb acc and my account disappeared and I was at character creation screen. Thank you. Last I play this garbage. A warning would hv heen nice  After some assistance I recovered my account but things like my bag I expanded has go be back to default capacity. Missed 1 day+ of game time, I lost touch with top players no chance of catching up with them, defeating the purpose of playing hard from the beginning of the new server. Found a new game to play, still playing this for fun but not going to compete anymore, nevermind buying more gems.",

I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",

Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

        "I've played many SLOT games & this is by far the most realistic one I've tried. I never invested any of my own personal money in any other SLOT games. I'm addicted to this one. It's fun & any bugs it had are fixed. So as far as SLOTS this is best!!! As far as poker it's the best one I've tried. I've tried about 25-30 different poker/slots games & I have only kept this one to play. (for about 4 years) I love it.",
        "Rigged. I like poker and even like to play for fun chips. However, when you get disconnected with QQ and then lose JJ with Trips to runners in a single session, and then get disconnected three times on SNGs when it's heads up (you disconnect you lose ... No time to reconnect or p/f you) ... Yea clearly a money hog (real or fake).",
        "Absolutely awful! This app is full of hackers, hacking chips from users accounts then selling them to other cheats. It's full of men pretending to be females using web pictures in the hope gullible morons will give them chips. Don't waste your time or money.",
        "It is what it is... you can buy chips or grind it out or donk and hope for the best. I've been playing for 5 years and never bought chips. Lots of super cool ppl, lots of donks,lots of bots. App loves set ups. Again, 5 years.  Highest bankroll was 97mill. Buddy online broke billion mark and kinda lost interest. Still fun, good way to make international friends.  Side note: I played with a close friend(never met IRL) tourney. We played friendly to see how screwed the app is... made it to the end when the app forces all in..3500? The hands were redonkulous. We announced all hands and it was always aa vs kk or similar and wicked setups trips vs full house Smh But still fun",
        "This app will steal your money. It has from me several times now and support won't do anything about it. This last time, I wanted to leave a room, I clicked to leave and nothing happened (old cards were still on table) I clicked again and nothing (cards still on table) cards were then cleared and new bets were made, then the screen cleared and I was removed from the table. 300k was deducted from my account and I didn't even get a chance to play. Support contacted and nothing. App Store, you need to look into these deceptive practices.",
        "\"Is it educational?\" Yes, because it teaches you that you can lose a massive amount of money in just a few minutes. I played for 2 minutes, and now I'm broke. Time to leave the casino!"

        "It was a lot better before I did the last update. There's 2 changes I really do not like amongst others. #1. I do not like how your money has to replenish to the amount of the table that you're playing on whenever you lose a hand. #2. Not being able to play on the named tables like we used to be able to,eg Lowballer-Card Sharks 3 or Big Dog-Big Boys 2. That's just a couple of reasons why I changed from 5 stars to 1 and barely play this game anymore.",
        "This used to be a really great game. You could join a table and your friends local or from out of state could join your table.  You could communicate with them while waiting for the table to fill or poke fun at them for losing a hand! Being able to pick your table not only let you play with friends but the wait time for a table to fill was cut in half. This feature alone is what made this game stand out among the rest... five stars for how it used to be!  I do want to say thank you for making a great product pre update! I had years of fun playing with friends and family until the update.   ***A friendly request, please put the option to choose a table back in the game the way it used to be. Thank you for all your hard work!",
        "Playing rounds u dont get them marked for playing. U dont always recevie your daily bouns either. This has been going on a regular basis. I have also noticed that if a player has the most $$$ on the table u loose most of your hands. I have been playing this game since 2015 n now I can even get in the game.  I do know if it's the game or Google , but I think  it is fair.",
        "This game is a total rip off. You win chips and then buy in to tourneys.  The app crashes and you can't rejoin your table even after rebooting.  You send a ticket to the site management and the don't resolve the issue and you repeatedly receive generic messages. Obviously forcing you to buy chips. Don't trust this site as it most probably steals your personal data and shares it against your will.",
        "If I could I wouldn't give this rigged ass site no stars!!!!! It's designed to let you win in the beginning, & once you build up chips.......its designed for you to lose so you can PURCHASE chips!!!! Once I uninstall this time, won't be coming back, plus I've told my friends to stay away",
        "App crashes EVERY TIME you use it. Returning to the lobby freezes the app EVERY TIME. Graphics are simple and 2-d, yet animation is still choppy and slow. And I use a Nexus 6P on fast WiFi to play, so the app is clearly the problem. Also, try playing 3 straight hands without some moron going all in on a 2-7 off suit. Everything about this experience sucks."

        "This game has a great support department, they try their best to resolve all issues that come up in the game quickly.  I love playing this game it has some of the most fantantic story lines and great graphics.  Again I would like to thank all the staff at My Tona makers of Seekers Notes and especially Amy Smith for all her help. Trina   P.S. I would like for the makers of the game to make the COINS available towards the purchase of RUBIES - either at the bank or in TRADE at one of the shops, I have $2,509,310.00 at this time and still accumulating, I never use that much at the shops.",
        "Deceptively simple it's very enjoyable and a little addictive. Challenging enough to keep me interested it can be a little frustrating that is not as generous as it could be with producing items needed but it's not so slow to produce as to put me off. Love the challenges and find the interaction with friends is simple. After the most recent update I noted a lot of complaints but these all seem to have been addressed by the developers.",
        "Only just got going on the game and so far it's a pleasant way to pass the time. I'm guessing it could end up costing a bit as some items are so hard to find!",
        "Love this game! Updates are just frequent enough that I can complete the missions before the next update without getting behind or waiting too long for the next update. Also good about listening to feedback",
        "Need tutorials more often during the game for fuller enjoyment.",
        "Great game. Love the variety and challenges."

        "This is a great game. It's fun, addictive, and a great time killer. The only problem I see is that I created an account on the game thinking it would save. WRONG! I had to do a factory reset on my phone and now I have to start over. I was so far with some really good cards, but alas I know more about the game now, so maybe I'll get there quicker this time.",
        "Don't bother downloading this game.  The customer service in this game is terrible.  I submitted a ticket because several combinations i researched in game disappeared.  I got a response that the game would fix itself and my ticket was being closed.  The problem didn't fix itself and i can't remember every combo lost. I submitted another ticket and I'm waiting for a response but after how my first ticket was handled I'm not confident they'll fix it. I've only been playing a few days but if the game is this buggy already then i don't recommend downloading it.",
        "It's actually surprisingly fun. The card mechanics are simple to grasp but with a enough depth to keep you trying new decks and combos. I chuckled a few times at some of the dialouge between the characters. 10/10 would recommend",
        "The game is addictive, but in short it's a gamble for cards. The prices are a lot for what you are getting. Lots of repetitive challenges. Unfortunately the quest for cards is really a quest for your wallet. I played since 9/16 and decided to walk away. Unfortunately you get to a point where the only way to move up is to spend, spend, spend. The gambling pulls for cards on real money game currency got old.",
        "The main problem with the game in my opinion is being able to attack your opponent while they have other cards in play. Perhaps if you could choose to block rather than be forced to take it the game would be a bit better aa youd have to manage your resources a bit better rather than beat hard until its over. Aside from that it is a very fun game to play",
        "Waste of money. No matter what you spend you never get decent cards. They stack the odds so no matter how you buy cards you'll always get ripped off. Mom's box is supposedly random yet I've bought hundreds of boxes I've never got anything worth a damn. I've played over a year and wasted a hundred bucks on this game w no reward. I strongly recommend you don't spend a dollar on this game. It won't help. The game will still screw you. Money will not help on this game."

I followed the FAQ guide (more like 2 sentences really) and my level 10 rare monster still lost to a level 2 common monster, even with type effectiveness.  If the battle system is fixed, then I will rate it 5",
        "I LOVE IT. It is soo amazing and deserves 200/5 stars. Its graphics are amazing and it is such a good time killer and mind occupier. The only downside is once you start. It is highly addictive. You cant stop so if you plan on deleting it soon dont. Ot has tons of cute animals too",
        "Here's the deal. You guys make it really hard to get anywhere on the game. I can never get through the challenges because I'm a poor person. While I have 31 million coins I have like no gems. So I can't get any of the good stuff.  I would really like to see that change.",
        "Not happy BUG ISSUES unable to collect from Festive Flower, just keeps spinning when I press the collect button.  Events are ridiculous if you are low level also forced to buy gems if want/need anything during events. Was a gr8 game but lately very buggy. Please fix. Even though I just updated, issue still exists.... Galaxy Note8",
        "It's fun but to hard to expand  to make room for new animals because  you have to breed to get to the mine. I would  like to  see boost on breeding and farming. It's impossible  to get gyms unless you  buy them or have to rely on people  gift them to you",
        "First snow event. Got my snowy owl, had space in my nest, can't hatch it. It's in storage with a black label saying goal along with 8 acorn tiles. Now what"

I played this game with a lot of people.  It was my favorite ga   me.  Want to play again!!!!                            It now works but you started me over and took all my life's I had saved up.  I was on level 700.  I used to really like this game and played it every day.  I hope I don't have to delete this game because I am not starting over!  Put me back where I was with my life's!",

When you ask for help they will always 1st ask \"is this the most updated edition\", even if you already told them you game is on automatic update. Its a good game, just frustrating to deal with",

It was getting tiresome going down to mine, a cave somewhere in the middle to find to restart a mission, then back to the top to smelt/craft. Then you have the auto mining platforms that are movable but one wrong touch and it resets.   Graphics were great.  There are other game like this, that don't spam ads during nongame play, that are equal or better",

Even if it was massively  over priced. Would be even better if you could save load outs for weapons and perks.",

        "It's sad to see people complaining and giving bad reviews about crashing but not knowing it's probably because their device is  g a r b a g e. I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "It's good and alot of fun but it's a bit of a tedious grindfest. 150% item find and I found nothing after going through ten dungeons. I want to keep playing but it's just another pay to win type. I understand you need to make money but I can buy a full loadout of epic equipment and run through a great portion of the game in no time. It's definetly worth giving a try but unfortunetly it's not for me.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!"

        "Not really easy to understand how to get started playing the game. I had to figure out a lot of it for myself but having to do that got frustrating so after a few days I just decided to uninstall it. It presents as cute and entertaining but trying to learn a game with minimal instruction doesn't give a great first impression",
        "This is one of my favorite mobile games. My only issue recently is I spent money on coins after a level to finally finish it but the game crashed and I ended up having to start the game over smh it keeps crashing but this is the first time it crashed without fixing itself...hope you guys do something about that",
        "Update: I read where you stated\" Our developers only release levels after they personally ensure that levels  are beatable without the use of purchase's\".  I was wondering, do they play a level for a week like I am so far trying to complete it? Are they really playing or it's what the computer tells them? I doubt that any of you are actually playing this game.",
        "I have played this game for months and it was fantastic until the last 2 updates. After those the levels became so hard it's impossible to beat them without spending money. If you enjoy playing the same level for weeks at a time then by all means download. Otherwise don't waste your time unless you want to spend money.",
        "Fun game but today while I have been playing, when I hit give up it keeps going to the 25 coins for 5 more moves no matter how many times I hit it. I have had to exit the app and reopen it to play the level again without spending coins. I hope this is just a glitch and not trying to get people to spend more money.",
        "I love this game however, it has taken multiple lives from me for no reason. The game starts you off with 5 lives & then I accrued 10 lives from winning multiple lives from extra spins. All of a sudden the lives just disappeared and I was reduced to just 5 lives again. This is the 2nd time this happened to me which sucks cause the game is fun as hell."

        "Overall great game as far as playing is concerned. Major thing that could use work is matchmaking. Currently an 89 overall getting matched against 98-105 overall players. No chance to win and may discourage some people from playing the game. The gameplay is awesome and I have lots of fun, 100% worth your time if you avoid Head-to-head or tournaments (unless you have money or don't mind being poorly matched).",
        "This is my full honest review. Madden Mobile is back!! I'll admit before it was not fun and I complained that you need to pay to win but EA really did good when I came back to play. The game is fun and is somewhat easy to get 100 overall players and now they are bringing back Draft Champs and I have seen early drafts and it looks great. The promos are great. I would like to say great job EA on bringing this game back and making it fun. I always want to play everyday and build my Ultimate Team",
        "I have played this game for 3 seasons now.  I can't even begin to say all that is wrong, but one of the things that stands out most to me, is that your players stats mean nothing.  You spend a lot of time and effort completing events and grinding, and improve your team only to find out that when you play a team way below your level, it seems that that teams players are much faster and tend to play way above their ability.  this game seems to have the liberal bug that everyone is equal.  I am done with this game, don't get caught up with it, it's not worth the waste of your time",
        "Thanks alot EA for this new head to head style. Great to know that all the grinding and work put in is only allowing those who have a 100 overall or better reap the rewards. Everytime playing one of these individuals they have a counter for every single play. This really turns me off to the game.",
        "For the person hoping to find Madden 18, this is the closest thing you are gonna get. Yes, it doesn't have practice mode or my player mode, but it DOES have a incredible roster of players that you bargain for. The graphics are pretty good for a game on a smartphone.  Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE for NFL fans. 10 outta 10.",
        "You know I really like all of the Live Events but when I get these old collectible cards that aren't worth anything I have to cut them one by one. It takes way too long and I've got over a hundred. I would suggest having a way to group delete or in Madden terms \"cut\" the old dead weight."

        "I absolutely love the story line and I've spent more on the game than I'd like to admit. But spending money doesn't really get you much farther because the energy goes so quickly. I think you would get far better reviews and more happy customers if you got rid of the energy system and upped the ads for more revenue from that standpoint. Then you could keep the micro transactions for the secret scenes. This way you'd still be making money,  but your customer retention would go up. I have so many ideas that would help this app out and I'd love to share them as I love this story. If you are interested in what I have to say please reply",
        "I love the game. Wish we didnt have to pay for every secret scene and had a little bit more energies before having to wait for more or buy some. Would be great if we had more options for free energy. Love the story and characters. Hurry with season two already!!!  Im anxious to see further stories on ryan and the character Lol ❤.",
        "It's really a good game. It's awesome! But that energies are my main problem! Don't you think that...... only 300 energies that means only 30 lines are not enough and too little for a day..!?..!???!.. and 10 energies per line isn't too much!!??! Please make it down to 5 energies for each lines...and only for dialogues.. And if you give 500 or 100 energies (if 1 line cost 5 energies then there will be only 100 or 200 lines. Not much for a whole day!!!!!) and take 10 hours to get free energies again then the game will be perfect!! Everyone can't buy energies (including me)! You know! Please consider this case sympathetically.!.!..  I beg you.....!....",
        "Lovely story line... love story that keeps you coming back everyday.... at times we are urged to buy energies.. however the energy provided gives sufficient dosage of the story each day... sad that it's going to get to the end...  And i wish I could go back and re read certain moments which is not possible.... apart from it.. this is amazing...",
        "Great storylines!!! Great graphics!  However the energy to even do one chapter is way too low!!!  There should be more choices in filling up the energy.  Let your veiwers choose to watch more ad's or something similar to games where each day you can have one chapter and keep the secret moments as a paid option.  I myself would  have more of my friends play,share and even buy if the cost wasn't $100+ for ten chapters!  Oh and FYI check your editing just a few hiccups in a few clips.   Huge fan on the writer/authors...  Very steamy!! Sincerely JR",
        "This game is misleading. You can only play the \"secret scenes\" if you pay, but the wording makes it sound like your choice so you keep playing in hopes you can see one. And the secret scenes I assume are the ones which actually push the relationship forward. The game staggers and is deeply misleading."

        "Addictive and  overall  good game but could be improved. Anyone that's played for a number of years will agree that changes in the last year are ruining the game. The events pretty much every month now are ridiculous.  The instant builds & gold abuse are out of hand. Used to be a game of skill, a level playing field in regards to age, background & financial means, where players skill level & strategy were tested on the battlefield, now it's become a pay to win game where teams are assembled based on how much they will spend to win. For all the $$ Inno is making off gold purchases, they fail to invest back into the game experience for a smooth running game. Example, the game will freeze up on a player being op'd and they are not able to effectively defend. This issue has been brought up many times to Inno & has yet to be corrected. Players know the glitch & many exploit it, again making for an unfair playing field. Many long time & loyal players are choosing to leave the game after finishing up current, active world's due to changes in the last year or so. For new players, it's a fun & addictive game in which you have the opportunity to meet & play with people from all over the world, but be advised the description is misleading, it's not a free game & based on skill as it once was. If you want to win, be prepared that you will need to spend a great deal in the newer version pay to win it's become.",

In other words they are a huge game that interact with the community setting up forums and listening and acting on user ideas and comments community is warm and friendly. Although they do mistake they do the best to fix it and give items for the time they took to make it. I will say this if anyone ask me what game I would suggest it will be this game.

        "I used to play this game and it never gave me the option of saving before and it still doesn't. That was over a year ago. I love this game but when I had to get a new phone I had to start all over, so I didn't play for a long time. I just recently redownloaded it and it still doesn't have a save option. When are you going to change that? I play one of your other games and it has a save option. When are you going to give this game a save option because I have mentioned it before and nothing has changed. I want to keep playing but I would also like a Google play save option in case I have to get a new device.",
        "This is a great app. It has great graphics and doesnt make up anything from the actual show like other games do. My little sister is just crazy for this game. She even pursuaded her friends to get this game! Amazing game, no flaws. Definetly worth 5 stars!",
        "I like this game. But there's a bug. When I try to watch a video to play a mini game for free, the video freezes but the pop up ads don't freeze.... It doesn't make sense.  Why add pop up ads when we're already watching them for the free mini games.  At first I couldnt put this game down, I became addicted, but since the bug started to happen, I started to lose interest.",
        "I'm not sure what happened but my game reset. What also stinks is my game used to be glitchy when I'd leave the game a day later and come on, not even two seconds passed in the game. If highly suggest to stay on online mode since that seems like the only mode that keeps time",
        "This is bullcrap! This is the second time this game has all of a sudden stopped working and I cannot get back in to play. I am soo disappointed that you keep letting this happen!! I seriously could use some HELP!!! Please FIX this issuse immediately!!! I want to continue to play MLP... :'(",
        "I will give this game 5 stars if u can get some help.  When ever I try to open my inbox to look at my shards or collect the hearts I have been sent,  my game just crashes. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game,  playing offline,  clearing the cache data and almost everything else I can think of. Also when I try doing anything with twilight I can't do any tasks, plus I can't find twiligr either.  Please help me. I love this game. But I may stop because it keeps crashing"

        "Fun and easy to pick up and learn quickly. The game has nice effects and a huge variety of characters to play an upgrade. Love the auto play button for when I'm doing something around my apartment. I can still play it but not having to keep my eye on it too much. Music and voices can get sort of annoying but that's what a volume button is for right?",
        "One of the better rpg strategy games out. There's a ton of things available to do if you run out of stamina. The main currency is diamonds which you can purchase but surprisingly they are not that difficult to acquire in game.  Overall I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed games like Fate grand order, syd story and dokkan battle.",
        "Its kinda good, not my favorite but still pretty good. Also, J hate that you took Sayori from Doki Doki Literature Club just so you can have it in your commercial. Talk about copy right.",
        "Game is fun. I like the arts of character, well designed but some new arts like Cynthia looks really weird. End game seems alot of harder, and lately requires alot of luck or money to get stuff like skins etc. Still a great game, been playing for over 1 year.",
        "I used to love this game before a few months ago and was having a blast just playing hours on end until the next daily mission. But ever since the update, servers are terribly slow, game always forces out from time to time. Even despite that internet is at a excellent proximity range, the servers are just terrible for some reason which is sad since as an experienced player who been playing and supporting this for over 1 year, it feels as if it's getting worse and worse with each new update",
        "This game has not fixed the commercial issue. Still illegal. Plus the loading screen is taking forever and it seems they did not like my last review so they deleted it."

I'm okay with pigggbank because I can see player's online around my board, atleast I can prepare myself, but NO, it's just suddenly gone like that, not cool! And it even took 80-90% of your savings, much wow...",
        "Fun game, but can get very frustrating cause Peeps steal your stuff before you can upgrade cause you ran out of rolls, which makes you want to spend money, 4 rolls an hour is a bit crazy, but I guess it works in making you want to spend money. It's free to play but it'll be difficult. But the game is fun when things are going right",
        "I emailed support and they have yet to get back to me. Trying to get idols to get the special dice and every box is repetitive even when I use gems to open gold box for rare ones, it's always repetitive. When you offer suggestions as they request for better game play they brush it off and just say that the problem you are having is part of the game. Why ask for suggestions when they are not listened to. Very disappointed in support, been a long time player since it came out. They seem to be all about making money now and could care less about their players.",
        "I only did one star to get y'alls attention. For some reason my game has started over, which sucks by the way, because I worked hard to get as far as I did. And when I start up the game, the only thing I can do is roll. I can't even log in or anything. Help!! 😭😭",
        "It's not a bad game, I would recommend that you turn OFF notifications because it will KEEP telling you that you have full rolls then when you open the game you only have 10. The figures never add up but it's fun from time to time.",
        "I love it! Play it when I wake up and before I go to sleep 😂 although they say the dice are random they clearly aren't, I know when there is 3 spaces to the police car I will roll a 3 and land on it.  Dice rolls need to regenerate faster tho"

        "VERRY DISSAPOINTING!!! the game play itself I loved, but I'm really upset that I had to start all over again from the beginning and this is not the first time it has happened, since the last time the app was uptaded (automatically) I opened the app and it took me to the first level agin as if I hadn't played at all, all the progress I had (AGAIN) was lost a 2nd time, I really hope that this gets fixed soon and when it does let me know so I can install this game again....sssooooo sad!! :'(",
        "I love playing this game, but it keeps on freezing which is very frustrating also the videos to get free gold does not play.",
        "I used to like this game until I got to cheeky tiki and that's when it would freeze and crash and when I would go back into the game it would wipe everything I had accommplished and start me back at the very first venue. I would lose all the money I had and all the gold bars I had which was over 1 billion. I emailed customer service about it and they still haven't put my saved file on. The game crashes all the time and when it doesn't it lags so much. They need to fix the bugs like right now.",

        "Overall, I love it but it would be helpful if we could get something like a monthly subscription. Maybe like 10-15 characters fragments plus 10-15 gems or something. It would help us be less grindy. It would help with collection and able to get legendary easier plus monthly revenue. I would love that. Compare to MFF which is a lot more hectic, you guys a bit more generous. Just please don't put any paywall characters. Hated that.",
        "Fun game but currency is insanely expensive. I don't mind spending money but this game is ridiculous. So instead of me spending a little I spend nothing. I guess my wallet thanks you. It's also so hard to level people up... They keep introducing new characters I have to level up to keep up with alliance missions. Those are fun but I want to level up my other characters too!",
        "It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.",
        "PVP is broken - Lowboy tactic and forcing you to use the back of your bench (or hurt your alliance) ruin most PVP days.  It's a known issue that they wont fix or failed to fix.  Devs gear game towards whales completely and tailor all modes assuming you have every toon maxed out at all times.  They try to change or fix the game but always somehow make it worse.",
        "PVP is now worse than ever! \"We've reworked it so you earn more points\" NO! We now earn less points because it's impossible to beat higher rated teams and still have full team remaining which means less points and why is every one of my battles only 3-6 points? This clearly isn't the same as others given their points haul. Fix the stuff that doesn't work and leave the stuff that does!",
        "Agreed that DS needs reworking but not frm one of the best to the weakest. Developers, do you even play your own game?? Wasted my $$ & time invested in him. I don't even have lobo if you think I use the 'lowbo' combination in pvp"

        "I can not say enough good things about this game! It's a big part of my life now as funny as that sounds. This game is so fun and involving without the need for pvp content (which would be cool probably but not needed). The units that you aquire normally throughout the game are enough to complete most levels. however, the gatcha capsule units are so cool and useful that you want to work to unlock them! Thank you Ponos for making such a great game and keep the colabs comin'!",
        "I love to play this game. It's a great time killer and can be very funny at times. My only problem is the difficulty spikes in the later chapters if there could be a few more mystery deliveries or cat ticket chances of those who have cleared chapter one that would be great. But either way this game is awesome and I would recommend anyone who wants a game that's enjoyable,funny, and a time killer battle cats is your go to game.",
        "Its a cute and fun game actually. The problem is, content related to 'watch ads' is more often out of the 'connection time out' message. I mean, what's the point of 'watching an ad' if the ad is ultimately unavailable and out of the 'connection time out' message. My connection really stable ping to google 40ms and even when i try to change my network it keep saying 'connection time out' please fix this! Its really annoying",
        "Game wouldn't open so I had to reset my phone and the game deleted itself. I 're installed and lost everything on my account. I spent so much money on this game too and I don't have my code as yeah it got wiped off my phone... not happy.",
        "It's very fun, and I've played for a long time, but losing all your progress is a huge problem. I've lost 2 accounts already. If your phone breaks the restore progress number doesn't do anything because you have to upload your information.  You should be able to hook your account up to Google, I don't understand why Ponos doesn't do this.  That way Google stores your progress in the cloud, and you don't lose all your progress all the time.",
        "I love this game! I got all my friends hooked on it in grade 4,and recently it has made a huge comeback in grade 7. My friends and I used to draw our own battle cats, and naturally that started up again. I looked through some of my old drawings, and I found a cat that I drew that was almost identical to kasa jizo. Is my FBI man selling my ideas to you???😀"

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",

I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Fun game, as the Score! Games usually are. Nice player system, solid multiplayer experience. But some changes need to be made: Tackling system needs revision. Need to be able to select tackler or cancel tackle. Far too much challenging from behind. Need to have tackle ready straight from kickoff, twice now I've conceded from kickoff because I had no tackle.  Players need to hold formation much better too. Higher levels with faster players easily get up the pitch in the break with no one around to defend.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update."

        "I'd really like to give this game a 5 star rating. Their customer service is fantastic. The graphics are great. Lots of missions to go on. And they have events every week. Exactly what I'd be looking for in a star trek game. But the thing I just can't get past is the gambling aspect for role playing. All I want to do is role play as a captain of a galaxy class starship. But after a month of almost daily spins at the Dabo table (including spending real money on the vip pass and dilithium, and rolling multiple times a day) I haven't gotten a single galaxy class schematic. I don't want to play borg, or klingon, or older enterprise (hell, I'd trade all of those for just a generic galaxy class). It doesn't seem fair the game doesn't give you a more direct way to role play as your favorite ship. Isn't that the whole point of a game like this?",
        "Great collections of star trek universe, but the game screams micro transactions and gambling around every corner. The game gives you a great concept that gets hindered by currency gates. Only play if you want a nostalgic taste of star trek themed free to play game",
        "I absolutely love this game! It's concept is (though not entirely unique to Star Trek) cool. I just love the voices for characters and would love more characters to have voices.  For the longest time I was a F2P player, and when Events first started I was constantly in the Top 1000 so don't buy into that \"You have to pay to win\" nonsense. If you do put money into this game make it the $4 Monthly Dilithium Card it is worth it $4 for 3000 Dilithium if you can afford it.",
        "Don't listen to the haters who say it's Pay for Play and DB is a greedy company. It's bull, no amount of money will get you where time invested into the game will. Oh, and if the game even loads slow for a second DB is likely to send free stuff. If people complain about somthing...free stuff. So I say keep up the great work! One thing though, I'd be awesome if we could name our starbases. Just a thought.",
        "Progress stalls unless you spend insulting amounts of money (dilithium prices are absurd) to get better characters. In the early days of the game you could progress easily, but now I feel as more high-paying players have joined they want you to spend money to progress, and their prices really are absurd. The game is fun, but they're greedy. In the events especially, those who pay more get significantly better awards. A bit disappointing for those of us that have supported the game with occasional purchases from the beginning.",
        "Love everythinggg tho id like to like i want to controle the ship my self manuver it myself open world like eh thats my piont this might change the game and other peoples view/perspective pionts but it would complete my dream of getting the one thing i always love and always will love star trek.😁"

        "Really wanted to love this game. Higham of Futurama. However, when I login I cannot do anything. Game stops as soon as I try to collect from buildings or click on a character. Kinda hard to enjoy a game which crashes every single time in about 2 seconds. I can see from other reviews that I'm not alone. Nice to see tiny Co taking it on board. Edit: not playex for two months, redownloaded expecting them to have fixed by not but nothing has changed. Game still unplayable, Bravo. Really impressed that they can ignore a game breaking bug for so long.",
        "I cant access my character no more glab is stuck in doop hq. Aint been able to use her for a couple of days now so im loosing out. The adds also dnt always load and crash other than that i like the game.",
        "Loved this game and played it everyday while it worked. But ever since the end of the Christmas event the game totally crashes after being on it for only 2 seconds. And none of the updates since then have corrected the issue.",
        "As a huge fan of the show, I would say the game does a decent job staying faithful to the characters, the story, and the recurring gags of the show. Sometimes the ever present monetization of the game can get a little blatant, but the developers seem to learn from their mistakes and have made a really fun game.",
        "Not challenging. Pretty boring. Game play is railroad... Chug chug chug choo choo... Don't even think it developes any sort of adventure or excitement. Graphic start good. Then go 8 bit? Frigging weird.",
        "Some characters like url can't be unlocked unless you go through a specific mission (moon part 4) and in order to go through the mission you need url... You need to finish moon part 4 to unlock the artifact for further expansion for omicron..... This makes no sense, the character can't even be bought.. so it's a dead end for the game, you hit a specific part and the game stops.  Can the developers help with this"

        "This game is good and the story was interesting. The reason why i give three stars is because the magic challenges sometimes need to consume lots coins or lunes. And everytime there is new event which need to collect bonbon... It is teally hard to collect it and instead we need to buy... i know this game is free for both pay to play and free to play... but all i see is pay to play since the bonbons need to buy and sometimes events that come back by popular demand also consume lots of money.... I actually liked this game but since you made this game really.... i had to give only 3 stars since the game had to use mk ey A LOT....",
        "Rather then an actual chapter as in some other games, game play is only a page in a normal book if you are lucky. I love the story lines but I would actually love to read the story and not be teased with a tiny blurb of the chapter instead. Maybe if the chapters were longer and worth buying tickets for I would actually spend more money on this game bc it's very cute.   Trying to play threw the stories are so annoying! You need sooooooooo many story tickets! The chapters should be longer per ticket.. it takes like 15 tickets to get threw a chapter! The only good part is u get 5 a day unless u buy more.... please make the chapter length longer per a ticket :( I'd like to actually read a story..",
        "I loved it , it is so addicting and the characters are gorgeous, but it is way too short. I find myself paying fake money from the game to buy tickets just to know what happens next! You might actually fall in love with the characters! That's how amazing it is!",
        "This is my favorite app and has been for almost a year. The only problem now is the adds they can get very frustrating and angering. I do put a lot of money into this game and wish you would consider taking away the adds per player after they put so much money into the game.",
        "I adore this game, I've almost had it for a year now. I chose Klaus and I am head over heels in love with him. I enjoy playing a little bit of his story everyday. The artwork is just beautiful as is the story. It's well written and interesting. However, there's one thing that really upsets me and that's the in game currency,  coins. They're incredibly difficult to acquire. Yes, there's the \"free coins\" but unless you want to spend actual money(which you're trying to avoid obv). The free options that take the least amount of time only give you 7 or 9 coins so good luck with that. Honestly, this game would truly be a 5 star gem if that was fixed. At least bump it up from 7 to 100 and make the offers that cost money actually work. I just did one(it was for a 1$ basically) and didn't get it. Otherwise, thanks for an absolute gem of a game c:",
        "This used to be my favorite Solmare game, but the pop-up ads have ruined it. They can pop open at anytime, playing loud music and ruining the experience. When they pop up, I usually just end up closing the app, no matter what I was in the middle of because they are so annoying. I will probably end up uninstalling this app because of them.  If this was not an issue, it would be a 5 STAR game."

        "i bought this game on my samsung galaxy s4 octa core version and it looks more of lagplay and not gameplay. this is dejecting as rockstar games has failed to optimise this game for android devices. it is recommended that they make necessary improvements and make the game playable for medium to high end devices. i have 4gb internal storage out of 16gb free yet the game lags, even on low settings like 0% resolution and draw distance .",
        "This game is so old school and gta 5 is so much better than this game but it is still worth playing. It has a lot of cheats and hacks but it is still very good. It plays up very x1000000 rare. This game is very fun and if you have seen my comment please download this game immediately because it's extremely fun and it is very easy to collect money ps its okay to play offline and if you have seen my comment i recommend you to download this game immediately and have a great time",
        "I loved this game wh3n I was young and this brings back the best memories of my child hood haha.. the controls are kinda lumpy when steering a vehicle. But all other movements are pretty good. Butt,if you happen to have a Xbox one s controller it works perfect on my galaxy s8 plus. Thanks for porting this game to android and giving the option to max the graphics out. Looks very good! Loving the portal game feel too haha!",
        "Just started, i am playing with an Xbox One controller and everything works perfect.  The only problem is you are stuck with the original controls and cant change the buttons functions.  I wish i could use the triggers for gas and braking for driving the cars like in GTA's 4 and 5.  Other than that everything is good.  A classic game, that runs smoothly, and is a great time nostalgia trip.   This one works so well that i am definitley buying the other ports as soon as i am done with this one.",
        "Game could be grate Game looks awesome but the controls don't work right. Walking and running is not fluid. It's stop and go. While driving it is very hard to steer while pressing the gas pedal. I have Max Payne and the controls in that are great what happened with GTA San Andreas. Please fix. Also could you make it so I can move the game to my SD Card. I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 4.",
        "Guys help please! i gave the game 5 stars because i like it so much. But there's a probleme that im facing now when changed devices i had all my data saved on a samsung alpha device, now i reinstalled the game on my new samsung s6 edge and i loged in, and there was no cloud save. Please help me find a way to fix this! Thank you"

        "I absolutely loved this game! The reason for the poor rating is it kept throwing me out of the game right when I would win bingos and I would loose everything.  Now I bought new phone of course transferred the app. And suddenly every thing i worked for is GONE!  All the money, dice, keys, etc. I'm back at level 1! Even after connecting to everything. So not happy. I'm uninstalling it. All the hard work. Just gone. Smh",
        "Used to really love this game. Now it crashes right in the middle of so many games. I've lost so many dice and gems due to this. A couple of times was forgivable. Now it's just killing the fun because, other than the crashing and not getting dice/gems back or allowed to return to game, this app is actually a blast.",
        "I am so sure that the game starts to cheat when I am about to get bingo. The game starts going faster when I only need one or two more numbers the Bingo's can be at 30 more to go and before you know it's counting down really fast and then no more Bingo's game over. But I still play and like to try to beat it.",
        "When it works properly it is great.  I cannot tell you how many times it just shuts down.  And when that happen you lose your dice, the boosts you have used, but get no credit for bingos already acheived or things already \"picked up.\" Lost thousands of dice so far.  Also, frustrating that Bingo overlaps the card, cannot tell you how many bad bingos I got from that.",
        "This is my favorite bingo game, but if they don't fix these bugs I am going to have yo delete the app.  Whenever i am playing, after more than 10-15 minutes, the game automatically closes and I lose the game I was playing. I am still having to play at least 20 games before I get a collectible.  Please fix these problems or I will have to delete.",
        "Do not download. It takes your dice and power ups. Half way through the game it stops and you do not get reimbursed them dice! Waste of time I actually got in contact with tbe supporters twice and nothing! So I just installed as I said I was going to!"

For those that use their facebook to login if you have error 11 log out of Taichi panda 1 and re login to Taichi panda hero's it should work.its how I fixed mines.going to top up again soon",
        "A good game that is now an utter pos. Patch at end of 2017 ruined the game and Snail shows no intention on fixing it. Their customer service on average sucks. Got a really long chat ban for saying those nubs talk too much. Supposedly there were bad words used there.",
        "It's a good game and really very addictive, they should get new servers for those who want to play or start again, because if you create a character where only those who are strong reign, it is impossible to advance for more than you invest or for more time you spend , it is impossible to play with 2 million power where there are people with 7 million who do not let you do anything and update the game to fix the errors",
        "Snail needs to ban ip of hacker's or get hack detection, losing to hackers is frustrating and is a waste of time without compensation. This shows how snail cares about it's supporters.....",
        "Tachi panda heroes I ask I get a refund for the purchase of special magic divine chest that I purchase at 1/28/2018, I was only given everything but the 4 divine armor, now can u please give me refund before I stop buying stuff from shop. This is not a threat. My player - unknownplayer US- s21 mist forest",
        "Dont top up because everything is balanced these days, top up is a waste of money in all the balanced events and it gives u next to no edge so your might dont really matter anymore. Bugs in dungeons will leave u stuck and needing to log out and back, world boss suffers from extreme lag often leaving you with only the one pair of side kicks, events are often not finished because of lack of participants or one dominant team, grand prix checkpoints fail to either register as you pass them or fail to appear at all leaving you with no choice but to do in auto mode. Hard to make events like honor canyon league when teams are filled with dummy accounts and people who use ios used a top up refund to get money back just to put back into the game which no doubt snail has no problem with. This game has the potential to be great but after a year of gameplay sadly  I see that none of these issues has really been addressed and because of this people have quit or sold accounts and the AU server is nearly dead!"

        "It's an OK game with pretty complex party building mechanics. But, it also has terrible progression that almost pushes you to spend cash if you're not patient.    And the controls...  For a mobile game, the controls is not very responsive, sometimes I decided to drag a character to attack and the game decided to instead move the character forward and switches with the front unit, in a game where formation matters, this breaks the whole system, and so in order to prevent that, you'll have to drag it slowly, so it registers properly   The hit box is also pretty terrible, sometimes I decided to attack but then it didn't register because I didn't hit the right hit box.   Overall the game itself is not bad, but it has slow progression and getting the 5* (which is very necessary especially the raid class item) is very hard, definitely play this game if you are a very patient person.",
        "Problems solved. Thank you",
        "I give this a 5. I'm F2P and the ??",
        "It's can be fun game(for a short)if you are not interested in the competitive aspect. If you want to be competitive you gotta spend a lot of real money because of prestige.Prestige xa give you additionnal stats to your unit.  You need to spend more than 800$ to have every stats bonus only avaible with prestige. You can gain a few prestige every year but they increase the prestige cap faster.  Pvp is boring, from bronze to silver all i had to do is put a tank on capture point to win. And now i have been losing 95% of all of my matches in gold( and i cant fall back i silver even if i only losses)  Guild arent interesting if you arent super powerfull as you do 0.1% of what a big player does.  It takes a long time to even be somewhat strong.  Pve is ok but really short if its the only thing you do.",
        "This game can be spendy but even without buying anything, you can still advance quickly. There are known bugs but it is address very quickly. I definitely enjoy the gameplay and involvement of the whole community to grow your team.",
        "Normally, I don't give freemium pay to win games 5 stars, but this one is different. Basically all the money options are crazily overpriced, but if you put the time in they give you tons of premium currency just for playing. I've been playing for awhile and it hasn't slowed down yet. I just wish they had a decently priced option because I'd like to support the developers, but there isn't really a good option, monetarily, to do that. Everything cheap is lackluster and anything worthwhile is expensive.    If you like tactics games this game can definitely holds your attention for awhile."

Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "Challenging gameplay with more realism than the first game.   Multiple graphical levels and AI skill levels make each race different.  Difficult learning curve but worth continuing to challenge yourself and get better.  You will be hooked playing the game for hours on end.",

Whats the point in spending £50 on a tripple A title which you dont have much intertest in when you can spend £3 on a game which is part of your life ! Stock car racing is magic and this game truly feels awesome. Graphics are incredible , controls are awesome fun once you played it abit and the game is well built :) huge thankyou to madcowie games for creating such a awesome game to play !",

Need to loosen slots. Been playing over 800 consecutive days and over level 1220. Side challenges and jackpots dont pay either. Best of all the slots I've played tbough. Would give 5 Stars if payouts were better and emails would work.",
        "Fun to play, and you can win real world comps in Vegas. I waited to review this game until I was able to redeem some rewards so I could know if it really works, and I'm happy to report that it does. We've redeemed two comped rooms and a couple other little things. Also play Pop Slots, points are shared between games, and Pop Slots has more rewards available.",
        "Great game. Need to be able to get free tokens more often and wins need to be more often. I see the bigger the bet, the less times you win, but must bet max to level up quickly. Yep, you loose your tokens way to often. Improve and I will edit my review. :-) update....deleting game. Find some other idiot who will pay to play it. Seriously, impossible to really enjoy without buying chips. Good luck!you will lose. BIG TIME",

And then WINNING A JACKPOT or a Big Win!   I'd love it!  & so would you....",
        "The games are ok and the graphics are decent but the payouts are not. I buy average 40 to 60 dollars a week in points plus the free points and the games games just don't have a good payout rate. That's probably the worst thing. And not alot of free spin hits. They use to now like everywhere else you can go they are tight and just take take take.",
        "Only downloaded because I need to get to level 15 for another game. Very slow progress because you win almost nothing. As soon as I hit 15 this game is getting immediately deleted. You just wait every 4 hours for a measly amount, spin it all away winning very little if at all within seconds. The daily spin is clearly fixed, never received anything but 21k, the lowest amount"

        "I actually really like this game, graphics are beautiful and the concept is fun... problem is, I've had it a week and been in the game 4x. It doesn't load... like ever. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and installed and nothing. It just sits on the opening screen, sadly I will have to delete. Wish I didn't have to but it's just wasting space on my phone now. Otherwise, I did enjoy it.",
        "Its completely pay to play. You have to use diamonds to expand your land, but you can't earn them. You have to buy them with real money. It would be a problem if you could buy a small amount for like $0.99... But the minimum is $10 Its ridiculous.",
        "I would love the game,if there was really something to do, no interaction,from what I've read this is a useless app.i got on after the update today,and my screen is blank except for my buildings,the scenery is gone,black! I am on a mobile and can't use any of the great functions everyone talks about. I can't even help my team,totally disappointed,that's for sure. And I've spent quite a bit of money. I am so bored.Theres only a couple things to enjoy on it.Come on ,why can't you get this game together for Android users?",
        "Playing on the phone app. I am disappointed that I cannot play the full version. I cannot send messages to my fellowship members, I cannot see their cities, I cannot participate in the events with my teammates. All I am doing all day every day is trying to build up resources for upgrades, and those are high compared with how much you can make. You cannot earm free diamonds, and many of the buildings you cannot get without them. Will rate higher when these things are improved.",
        "The game is beautiful, but its a bit to complicated. And the in app purchases are rediculus. I'd love it if you could actually advance in the games. There are just too many things needed to advance in the slightest. It's too bad cuz the game it has great graphics.",
        "Game is great. Love building games. Only letdown is that is pay-to-win. It would be better if non-paying players would have little more easy time with game, like give more builders at least... 😉"

        "Cool, nice improvement from MCoC. I love how the dev put Generation version of Transformers to the game specially Combiner wars and Titans Return (my recent favorite TF toylines). i hope the dev put references in the generation bots name since the movie and beast war character has reference on it.  But 1 thing is why my achievements doesn't work ??",
        "Beautiful graphics, love the collection of characters. One of the greats, definitely a must. Love the aesthetics of the maps and battles. My only complaint is my bot entering the fight already transformed unlike the cpu. I think both should enter in alt form THEN transform, if only to hear the sound lol.",
        "Much better than I thought it would be. It's an unconventional fighter to be sure but it's fun. The models in the game are amazing and somewhat bum me out they aren't being used for a more traditional 2d fighter on a thing that uses controllers. They were even able to make the Bayformers look good!  The many currencies and general in-game transactions are probably turning me off of what is otherwise a neat game. Kinda wish I could just buy it, have everything unlocked, and not have any of that garbage influence the design at all.  Besides that the team did a great job with what I imagine Hasbro told them to do.",
        "Great game good graphics nice controllers needs more characters and more unique attacks, had to edit from a 4* to a 2* star because the game is a fighting with no live action PvP mode. It's strictly a player vs ai game and that is unattractive to players who enjoy the competitive edge of a PvP fighting game. Will uninstall it gets very boring and repetitive , with out the PvP mode. Will reinstall when or if PvP ever becomes available. Me and a larger group of fighting game players will be waiting to invest in this game once PvP becomes available.",
        "I think it is an amazing game. I have a few requests: Have the dupe rate of daily crystals lowered Add more ways to get Energon  Add at least one of these:  Rumble Frenzy   G1 Onslaught  G1  Hot Rod   Prime Soundwave   Any G1 Stunticons  Cyclonus #Gameoftheyear",
        "The game is good but worst thing about this game is that it always needs cellular data for every fight. I have 4G network then also it keep Loading in a very slow speed. I request to the game management to give feedback on this problem."

        "Have been playing for over a year and liked it.  Other games reward better, but love the quick hits games.  Since last Sunday, crashes within seconds of opening. I see others are having the same problem and all you say is please email us.  Fix your game or I'm moving on here and at the casino.",
        "Its an okay game, the problem is seems like everyday you end up getting around 200000 coins, and you play for about 6 minutes before you need to find another game to waste some time. The min bet is around 8100 and if you want to play a new or \"the machine of the day\" min bet is around 25k. I suppose its realistic considering you rarely win.",
        "Plays better than my casino, good days bad days but fun. Likein the open game days Suggests higher bonus free play as level up very slow. Awesome help staff 5 stars 3.19.18",
        "Took over a million bucks from me without even playing. It was a glitch or something. They tried to give me 175,000 as free credits the next day. Pissed me off.  Haven't played since.",
        "CRASHES! I♥'d this Casino! I can't go 2 the Casino often bc I stopped goin 2 the SCAMMING INDIAN CASINOs so it takes 3 hrs 2 drive 2 a REAL honest GAMING COMMISION REGULATED Casino, so this Pacified me until then. But this 2 is a rip off game, the 2hr Bonus Game. If u watch most of the time the timer isn't even moving so 2hrs is more like 4 hrs! Just another company 2 RIP U off, STOP Falling for this! STOP allowing them 2 win!"

        "Really wanted to love this game. Higham of Futurama. However, when I login I cannot do anything. Game stops as soon as I try to collect from buildings or click on a character. Kinda hard to enjoy a game which crashes every single time in about 2 seconds. I can see from other reviews that I'm not alone. Nice to see tiny Co taking it on board. Edit: not playex for two months, redownloaded expecting them to have fixed by not but nothing has changed. Game still unplayable, Bravo. Really impressed that they can ignore a game breaking bug for so long.",
        "I cant access my character no more glab is stuck in doop hq. Aint been able to use her for a couple of days now so im loosing out. The adds also dnt always load and crash other than that i like the game.",
        "Loved this game and played it everyday while it worked. But ever since the end of the Christmas event the game totally crashes after being on it for only 2 seconds. And none of the updates since then have corrected the issue.",
        "As a huge fan of the show, I would say the game does a decent job staying faithful to the characters, the story, and the recurring gags of the show. Sometimes the ever present monetization of the game can get a little blatant, but the developers seem to learn from their mistakes and have made a really fun game.",
        "Not challenging. Pretty boring. Game play is railroad... Chug chug chug choo choo... Don't even think it developes any sort of adventure or excitement. Graphic start good. Then go 8 bit? Frigging weird.",
        "Some characters like url can't be unlocked unless you go through a specific mission (moon part 4) and in order to go through the mission you need url... You need to finish moon part 4 to unlock the artifact for further expansion for omicron..... This makes no sense, the character can't even be bought.. so it's a dead end for the game, you hit a specific part and the game stops.  Can the developers help with this"

        "Ive been playing this for a year and a half and i can say this game is NOT a pay to win. Pull rates are pretty much the same as in any other game, and units are tradable 90% of the time so its possible to get units you want even if youre not lucky enough to get them from packs. Platinum units are super helpful and are now much easier to get thanks to golden medals which are pretty easy to get in events. Theres different events, some are for unions, some you play for yourself. Also, a game with most friendly users ive met in games, willing to give a lot of help and advice to new players. All in all, ive played for a long time and i dont see myself stopping any time soon unless theres drastic changes",
        "I love this game. Though they don't explain how to obtain platinum medals or how unions work very well. And I would like it if we could exchange 7s units better. I could list 10 units I'd rather have then idun. I would love to exchange her for a Gilles de rais or a fenrir. But no I have to keep this unit I don't want. Because my idun can't even be sold on the bazaar. Though those are my only problems. I'm addicted to this game.",
        "It's really a good game. I've been playing this for a long time. The reason I didn't give 5 star is because there is a player who start arguing with the other player for no reason and i hope i can report this to the game developer but my friend say it would never work.",
        "I've been encountering some problems with the game in terms of going through a quest. It just suddenly bonked me out of the game everytime i get to the boss. I've tried clearing the cache  and reinstalling it but  to  no avail.  I'm using an oppof1s  and whether I connect through  Wi-Fi or other means. It does the same thing. Would like some help with this",
        "I have two copies of this 7* card that is essential to my deck at the moment. Unfortunately they screech this annoying Yossshh yaattaadaraa!!!!!! EVERY freaking time they launch a special. Then freaking golden apples fill up the screen. Unfortunately they are two of my strongest cards. Thinking of dropping this game.",
        "Been playing for a long time seeing the game develop but as of recently when they switched to parade. Pay to play has been so heavily support worse than other games from the platinum club or vip to basically making it impossible to win or even compete without spending money in events especially when they make event units untradable this has not happened for 2 years the game has been out and now they r just plain greedy this game is committing game suicide and it was such a great game before but now they always have their hands out for money its really disappointing."

In a game that involves the collection of various characters, it can be disheartening to spend money on this game and still not get the tsum tsum you want,  even during the so-called \"lucky times\". I recommend keeping your money in your wallet since it is unlikely that you collect the ones that you want, when you want them.   There is also a minor glitch in loading the game, but if you try multiple times, it will eventually load.",

You should patch the game after some time, after you have the revenue. Cars not even look like they \"look\" in the real life. The gameplay is alright so far, might become enjoyable for a longer gameplay.   Just started, but I wasn't suggested to invite my friends to play. Correct it also for making the community larger. Where is the option to play with my friends? Also, any crew creator option? So far , 4/5. Started yesterday",

It does have pacts of cards to buy with real money, yet at the same time you earn gold coins to buy same packs. You can easily save the gold coins to buy these packs. LOVE THIS GAME",

They r broken",

The rewards for victory are so small it's almost impossible to upgrade your base unless of course you pay for a shield,but even that's a scam cause with a shield you can't atracvk enemy bases.  Everything is basically pay to upgrade or spend forever trying to save up and even then. Bottom line ftx games are a scam.",

You watch adds for a speed up, nothing happen, you install other apps for gold, nothing happen, you submit a report to customer service,nothing happen, they send back problem solved and they didn't do anything about. I bought gold for the app from one of their sponsors, nothing happen. I report it , a girl named Daria sent me back a email and said problem solved, guess what...NOTHING HAPPENED",
        "Total rip off dont waste your time or money. Ever since update..its horrible. The developers will swipe your gold away (basically your money) and give an excuse that your bank or Google issued a refund. After showing and providing evidence that your never received a refund...they do nothing about it! Straight run around. And good luck talking to support..generic responses like the one they give on here.",

        "I love your latest update! Also thank you for fixing the \"internet connection lost\" issue! 😊 Love the new character by the way! *-*)/ Great job!   I do have a suggestion, can you add like a one park/any place where players can meet with other players and chat? It would be great to interact with other players, not just in your guild group 😊 hoping you'll consider it. Thank you so much for making this game! So addicting!",
        "It'll be nice if we earn those ITEMS given in the stages description.  I kept on earning only common item no epic or legendary.  Which is sad but game is smooth which is good.  Thank you google for the update.  If we may add would love an auto healing potion during adventure. Thank you",
        "Edit: Issue was resolved and devs were very quick to reply and help, which they seem to do consistently. I really love this game because it's easy to get good equipment and currency, you aren't forced to pay to win. Rewards for login/quests are very generous, prices of cards to equip new items isn't unreasonable. The characters and items you can equip look stunning. The only thing I can criticise is the unbalanced PvP, but I solve that by not playing PvP lol.",
        "Marvelous heroes, outstanding graphics, excellent costumes, and cute pets. I realy like this game. But I hope this game would turn into an open world where all players could see each other at a single area. Perhaps a town or some kind of a city where everyone could gather and more features like whispers, world chat, etc. Well aside from that the game is totally amazing. Would much likely recommend this game.",
        "Great game beside the fact it is a memory-eater this is exactly what you expect from cell game in 2018 good graphic smooth gameplay and enough energy reward not to worry about beeing stpp because of a lack of it. The omly downside is the pvp which is build in a way you are up against player who 1HKO you which get pretty frustrating.",
        "Can't play the game after the latest update. I've downloaded the latest update, able to play it for few minutes. Then, it stop responding. When I tried to relaunch, after the Google Play Store and Nexus logo, it just stuck on the black screen. Nothing happened, waited for 5 minutes, still nothing happened. So I deleted the app and reinstall it. Still stuck on the black screen after the google plastore and nexus logo. Hopefully u guys patch this up ASAP, and I'll gladly change the rating once this is sorted out"

        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",
        "Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It's entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Good game. Defintely like that you can play offline. Most of my issues with it are really minor except for the fact that the background especially things like walls, trees and hills can sonetimes block your view. There have been a bunch of tines where I couldn't see enemies that were right next to me because a wall was there.",
        "Great game so far! Love the old school feel to the game! Resembles Diablo a lot! But I love the Diablo series so being able to play a game like that from the palm of my hand...GOLD! Tons of customization from characters, skills and equipment upgrades. Most of the better items are obtained just by playing! No need to buy items, save those gems for more skills to adding more companions to fight along side you! Running low on gems...just keep playing! Love a game that rewards you just for playing! Keep up the good work guys! I don't post reviews unless it's worth it so......see you out there!",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell"

The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear.

Keep playing the same level over and over until you can upgrade, play another level, then proceed to keep playing the same level again. The competitive mode is also messed up as the opponent gets scores near impossible",
        "Everything is great and good but only have one problem. And this problem will killing you all. That's the loading is damn slow no matter you are in LTE network or wifi situation. Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",
        "Even with a perfect LTE speed game struggled with downloading hunts. The game forces you to do certain hunts before you can go back to the ones you like and want to finish. Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",
        "Awsome game, the only thing wrong with it is that it takes forever to load. The graphics are amazing and so is the gameplay. This is something that could keep me entertained all day and I wouldn't get bored.😺👌",
        "The game currently wont open, when it does its constantly crashing and force stopping. I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",
        "During cts theres moments get sudden lag and it throws off the shooting causing to miss when i know aiming right. It never had these lag bits before."

I was told if I came back each day I would get free coins not true, I didn't get 7000 coins when I watched a movie, and when I played  max bet I got the same pay out if I was playing for 500. I love the games you have but the payouts are terrible if you can fix these things I wont delete.  But if not I'll  play out the coins and  tell my friends and family don't bother with this game.

I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "It's good and alot of fun but it's a bit of a tedious grindfest. 150% item find and I found nothing after going through ten dungeons. I want to keep playing but it's just another pay to win type. I understand you need to make money but I can buy a full loadout of epic equipment and run through a great portion of the game in no time. It's definetly worth giving a try but unfortunetly it's not for me.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!"

        "I wasn't expecting to like this game. But I LOVE it. I don't generally like FPS games and although that's a considerable part of this game, there's so much more. I love the horse racing and the mini quests that take you on scavenger hunts, exploring the two giant maps! I'm a big fan of the Old West and I'm a big fan of this game too. I've had it for about a year now and it still isn't old. The multiplayer is really fun too. Great game, especially for the (nonexistent) price!",
        "Its a very addicting game! Good for a use of passing time by. Needs some work on mobile controls tho. But over all, its a fasinating game! 😀 Has GREAT graphics and a spectacular gameplay! But, getting silver stars is just WAY to hard. There is almost NO possible way to get them. Please add more ways to get them. Like finishing certain missions.",
        "Its great game but some of the issue that i dont like in this game is the stars. Its hard to gaining them plus its not free overall need to purchase! My guns is out of ammo and i was force to buy and it was not free. Also slots are expensive! Are you guys want to steal money from us or want us to play? I want it free to play overall. Please make the game more realistic than ever also graphic make it high detailed. Plus it crashed often when im playing what the heck is that?? Thank you. You guys did a great job but just that. Make that improvement please then i will enjoy the game fully without any payment made.",
        "I would like to work with you guys, I got lots of ideas to help improve it and or make a new game.  Also there seems to be problems with the multi-player function, it was working two days ago and then it stopped,  and when I try liking on Facebook for 2 sherif stars it doesn't complete the action. Events don't work for me either.  But still it's a fun game kind of",
        "Okay love the game, good gameplay, I just think with size if the game the graphics could be better  And the aim button should be moved from the left side to the right side of the screen. Its kinda hard to ride a horse chasing a werewolf when the aim keeps getting in the way.. Overall 8/10",
        "The game is okay? Ang the graphics and controls are super natural I love Gameloft company because the games made are so very addicting playing plz update? This showdowns Gang  I'm gonna rite this again right now?"

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Please give us the option to disable Auto Target Tracking in settings.  The auto tracking can cause you to fire at ships your not wanting to target, especially if there lined up side by side. And cause your shots to fall way short or too far if the enemy ship is coming straight towards you. If love to have the ability to disable this feature in the settings."

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

        "The game is fun, but by there is Soo much going on with rewards and goals and extras. I honestly have no idea what's going on on the game map. THE SHEER AMOUNT OF ADS IS INSULTING.",
        "Love the game but when connected to internet u get bombarded with flashing ads which makes the game keep restarting over and over. Makes it unplayable.  Can't get past first tournament can't get daily reward.",
        "I like the game but the amount of ads are so annoying. It's hard to enjoy a game when you keep getting bombarded with ads every other second.",
        "Fun game but shuts down A lot!!!  Must then wait for it to re load. Very annoying. Any ideas why?",
        "It would be great if ads didn't pop up every 30 seconds. Too annoying"

        "So far, not bad.  Update:  gathered enough parts to repair the university and it won't unlock.  I emailed the developer and haven't heard back.  It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can't use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great game with good potential. I love it. But there are still some minor bugs the car baler somtimes acts weird. And the dismantling process sometimes goes reverse. And then there is the part of collecting building materials. It is too hard and we need to be able to get building materials from elsewhere than the scrap cars. All of them including wood, bricks, and concrete. I am looking forward to the car repair function.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly"

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game."

The AI is horrendous in it's mana drop fairness (i.e. you get a single drop of mana, next move the AI cascades practically the whole screen) The entire mechanics are based on P2W. If you like the actual card game, DON'T PLAY THIS GAME.",
        "This is an intricate card game where you build your decks and match them against decks other players have built. The mechanics are simple, the complexity comes from combining cards that play well together."

It renders the game unplayable due to constant log in prompts. It cuts your play off mid-move causing you to uninstall out of sheer maddening frustration.",
        "If you love games like Farmville and Candy Crush Saga then you will love this game. Not only is the game a matching game it also has a farming twist in it. You get to take care of animals as well. Also I have only seen 1 ad so far and I'm on level 15.",
        "This game isn't bad at all except for the fact that certain parts require internet connection, and still doesn't work properly when connected to wi-fi. Also it has a horrible glitch problem, I've had to force close the app numerous times. I'm over it.",
        "Match 3 games are my favorite types of mobile games and this one is an exceptional one because it stands out from the others with it's gameplay and visuals. Like I already said, match 3 type games are my favorite kind and  this is one of the better ones that I play. The only problem I really have is that it likes to freeze up and pause on me quite often but I don't really think the game is to blame, at least not solely,l. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I fill my devices up to the max with misc. Junk.",
        "Love the game, in fact it's my favorite. However it freezes constantly. You lose lives..it knocks you out all the time. I have been playing this games for years and it still freezes and crashes! PLEASE FIX THE BUGS!!"

The only thing that would make it better is if they actually gave out gems. This is their 1 downfall - not receiving any gems at all. Therefore, you are forced to either buy them or select the choice you didn't really want in order to get the free choice. This, of course, changes your storyline. However, you can see at the end of each episode the percentage of your choices compared with other users and its normally in the 90 percentile. Still this is a wonderful game that I would highly recommend.",

It's no longer competitive on skill, it's just about how much you are willing to pay to get upgrades which negates any skill involved. It's just a money grab. If you don't pay and upgrade you lose!

I can't even navigate the menus now without a 60% chance of getting a 15 second video about some crappy game with \"war\", \"clash\" or \"clans\" in the title...  Other than that, the gameplay itself is ok. Aside from maybe the lowered necessity for Tetrises because of power-ups or the annoying-ass \"some pieces are affected by gravity, but we won't point it which ones until you cause them to drop by attempting to set up your next move\" mechanic.  Seriously though, those ads after EVERY GAME NOW are cancer on toast. Knock it off.",

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "This game is awesome overall. But some changes could be made like adding German league players (especially AUBAMEYANG though he's moved to England) and when you face them leagues top players( in the game) you could add the legends like Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others. Hoping to see these changes in the next update. Thank You!",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

The controls in card battles on the phone are too fiddly, considering there is a lot of unused space on the screen: this would have been developed differently if it wasn't attempting to mimic the desktop version. Lazy! Is the \".. playing over WiFi...\" warning still relevant? Unlimited mobile data and 4g means many of us have as good a connection as fixed line. Love the game, thank you.",

But I did get my last account deleted for some reason I was mad and couldn't get it back so I had to create a new one",
        "Everytime I play a club arena game (free every 24hours) it will keep telling me i disconnected from the game while my Internet connection is fine. But when I play other normal arena games, it turns out fine. I find it very annoying because i have to wait 24 hours to play my favourite club games and it always disconnects, and it makes me mad. I hope you notice this comment and leave a reply... Please fix this... Thanks :(  Edit: It works fine now, thank you! :)",
        "Very fun game, my most played game by far but the major issue in this game is hackers. You get good and start to play the end gamers and realize 90% of them are bots with millions of coins and as soon as the game starts you are sent balloons to your side that cannot be activated until round 15+! It's frustrating to earn my coins legit just to have them taken by all the hackers and bots. Ruins the game when makers aren't doing anything about it.",

I played this game with a lot of people.  It was my favorite ga   me.  Want to play again!!!!                            It now works but you started me over and took all my life's I had saved up.  I was on level 700.  I used to really like this game and played it every day.  I hope I don't have to delete this game because I am not starting over!  Put me back where I was with my life's!",

When you ask for help they will always 1st ask \"is this the most updated edition\", even if you already told them you game is on automatic update. Its a good game, just frustrating to deal with",

        "O am stuck on the sam mission gor 1 year  Ago. I have  Legendaries max out i hit theme with  Critical i barley hurt theme they hit me one time and i get one hitted why dont my hit theme  one time and they die it not fun no more",
        "I think it should be more even. The same monsters you face have passive abilities that your same exact monster doesn't. Also, you can't pick two of the same kind, but all your enemies can. It's ok. Other than that the game is great.",
        "This game needs some more monsters (preferably ones you don't have to pay for I've spent more than $300 on this game). It needs more adventures and easier ways to let your monsters ultra evolve. I'm tired of waiting like a month just to get an omegaroid or vorbaook for my monsters to ultra evolve. This games needs more monsters and a new league as well."

We battle to take the lead and to see who has the most chips! It's a fun and exciting way to keep in touch with her. Thanks for this game/app!!  Sincerely,  Long distance daughter & Mother 🤓",
        "Fast paced game and love it! Chances to keep getting extra coins and bingo credits by watching the short video or I found out by playing lower levels you had completed to play them again to get more of what you need! The higher levels you go you need more bingo credits so this works to your advantage! Great game and love it!",
        "I really like this game as you get plenty of credits to play and alot of games to choose from. The only thing i didnt like was that i was in the middle of playing a bingo game and i lost internet connection and i didnt get my credits back from that. Other games on other sites if something happens when you are playing a game such as getting a phone call or losing connection you will get your credits all back for that game.  I just wish there was that option on here",
        "never gives your bonuses after watching videos.  when trying to get your daily bonus and others it plays a video before you can get them. then gets hung up on boot after you close out.  have to reboot game every time and it still does the same thing.  fix updates please. Not getting keys for watching videos",
        "I  like Bingo. I don't like all the ads! If you want me to click on an ad I would appreciate  something in return, like credits or coins. There used to be an option of buying 3 power ups for 500 coins, now I have to click on an ad. Or buy 4  FOR 1000 COINS.  I ALSO NOTED THAT YOU ONLY GIVE BONUSES AT NIGHT, . People like me also play in the daytime.",
        "Never seen such bad cards. It's way too hard to bingo. You get set and wait for 40 numbers and you still don't win. You may not get to daub your first number until the game is over. Not much fun"

What i mean by that is, almost all of the items are being sold by gold tickets (which i cant top-up) . please add more items that can be bought by silver coins.. I have like 16.5k on my acc and i have nthing to buy... Please read this and make this possible ..if possible thankyou..!",

I do however wish that after you get shot and knocked down that you would have a chance to restore health rather than die. But I do understand that if that were the case, the games would last a lot longer. I love the game, the graphics are as good as could be expected for a mobile device but the game play is so fun!! Great job!",

No complaints graphics are better than rules of survival, less stuff to pick up, but smoother game play, instant match making 90% of the time, great community, constant improvements, very very happy with this game. Spending money has no point other than style and bragging rights no effect on in game play.",
        "Great game, very addictive! But a lot of hackers in the game, making the game unfair. Hackers usually performs: 1 shot kill Goes under ground and kill you while you can't shoot back Unlimited health See through obstacles I hope the game developers would update and get rid of those hacks",
        "Nice job developers! After that small update you've screwed up the loading screen! There's isn't a start button and other selections like shop, warehouse, etc those are bugged out also. Next time, tell us when there's an update even those small ones its happens unexpected. Fix it ASAP",
        "I think this game has more things than other games but the graphics is some how really i can't describe it. It is good and it is not just like that. That is the describtion.... I joined today and  played with squed and i won the game me only. Hope you will enjoy this game and happy wishes all of you"

If only you had the actual game you advertised and not a total different game all together.....  Stop false advertising sick of it",

It reminds me of a game I played in elementary school English; our teacher would give us a set of letters and we had to create as many words as we could from them.  Really, it's a good game to play while on break at work when you don't have an internet connection.",

        "Challenging game against live players. Lots of contests and bonuses. Levels of play from beginner to world class. One drawback: all levels are open entry, so more experienced (and less ethical) players will enter into Beginner to collect quick victories. The designers should change the game so that once a badge is completed, players should not be able to enter games on that level again. This would be fair play for beginners, encouraging them to continue playing. Hope this is implemented in an update.",
        "Game graphics and play are great. However dice rolls are seriously flawed. Doubles way too often. Not even close to real rolling. I've seen 2 sets of doubles in way to many starts of the game. If doubles are so common why don't you ever see 3 doubles in a row to start. Don't ever leave a piece open because the next roll will knock you almost every time. The developer obviously likes frustration proven by the childish limited chat emojis.",
        "They need to fix the dice roll. Its absolutely a big cheat...no way can some roll exactly what they need to get out of a tight position that often. Its really horrible it ruins the whole game.",
        "I think it's safe to say based on the dice timing, that this game app, like all the rest, is favoring a particular player in order to end the game quicker. The auto play is annoying and not possible to turn off.. but the layout is nice.",
        "It's the worst game i have ever played , they are thieves , when you double and you lose they deduct twice the bet and when u win they only give you 45 percent of ur total winning money.I played a game and won 255 thousand , but they only gave me 120 thousand , and when i lost they took out 255 thousand from my money.If you dont believe me count ur chips and see.They suck so go to hell with this lame unfair idiot game.",
        "The dice rolling is not random at all !  It gives ridiculously lucky dices and game over in 3 or 4 turns. Do not play it. NO RANDOM DICE, NO FUN AT ALL !!!"

        "Great game but you find a lot of in game duplicate hacker's which sucks because I have spent a lot of money on gems and then you got people ranking scores that are seriously not possible but they get rewarded first place ur cards so in the end, great game, awesome artwork, dedicated fanbase, childish modders/dupe hackers. Personal opinion gems are way overpriced. Once again though fantastic artwork. Thanks mynet keep updating",
        "This game is old and when it came out, it was amazing. I put so much time and money into it. Then it died, to be brought back years later without any form of revamp. The graphics are pixelated, it burns so much battery when the most animation that comes out of it is something you'd get out of a powerpoint slideshow. It's extremely glitchy and the loading is so slow. I'm so sad they re-released this to suck money out of people yet couldn't put in any effort to make the game updated and modern.",

        "Wish the hearts were half price and that I could replay episodes without paying a new ticket. I've spent an embarrassing amount of money, about 900usd and counting. The overall quality of the stories is good. The variety of characters is good, but it would be nice to have more than one female love intrest per story. Go Persephone! 😻😚💘",
        "This is great! The best romance game I've come across. Only thing is maybe more female love interests and definitely have a system that gives you like 5 hearts a day? Just to get those back because I haven't played the game in a week and a half because of no hearts.",
        "Hearts are too expensive and the hearts needed for some choices are way too high. Daily loggin rewards don't have a good enough chance to get them either. Stories are great and I enjoy them very much. Would recommend for others even those who don't want to spend the money. I myself haven't paid a cent because of the high prices.",
        "I really enjoyed reading different stories. Loving this apps.Just please add more tickets... and also it takes forever to waitq for the next season or episodes..it spoils my excitement.. please don't make us wait .. your stories are all really good..just make it more fast in adding new season or episode please please please",
        "I've been playing the game for a really long time now since I was 13 or 14 and am now 17 turning 18 this year and I'm sooooo happy with how it's grown but the one issue I have is the hearts thing. I can't pay the specific amount to get a whole stash of heart and it really bugs me because I love the options that you give us but I don't have hearts...can you please look into it and come up withe something ?",
        "This game is addicting and is very fun I think you will love it.I did so try it out and see what happens.The one I loved the most was gangster love ash so I advise you to try that one out if you want.Also with the gangster love series try out chance he's fun"

        "Easy to pick up and varied game play.  Some of the controls can be a little repetitive but not to the point of distraction.  Keeps you interested and doesn't require a great expenditure of cash if you are a relatively casual player.  Plenty of good themed events.  All in all a good distraction which I have now been playing for almost a year !",
        "I have been enjoying this game very much since I installed it maybe about a month ago. I actually stopped participating in a game that I've been in for 3 years for I find the is more entertaining, better graphics, quick response time on tickets and the community is more open. Highly recommend this game; which I might add is for all ages and gender who enjoy space battles and strategy. Thanks eh",
        "Love this game. it would be nice to know what kind of equipment you are going up against in war like you see when you are in pursuit mode i.e. DT, CR, MS, BS and what kind of weapons and defense. Thanks for the great game",
        "Great game with a large degree of strategy. Unfortunately, recent changes make it very difficult to obtain good heroes without P2P. This is most likely going to erode the free to play player base resulting in a game that is not as fun to play. Hopefully this can be rectified in future updates.",
        "Ooh dear ooh dear how sad,, yes that directed to you again astro-(I've run out of ideas an getting desperate now)-nest.  Just had a login gift (cue fanfare) which was 2 pointless training id's.. Big bloody Whoop. Oh an let's not forget the equally pointless (get your hands in your pockets/debit/credit card rip-off) St Patricks day event. Cue no crystal/AP boosters.. Seriously you jokers should all have stripey shirts on with a little printed card with numbers on attached.. What's truly sad is the games good, possibly even great.. But! Greed as always outweighs the gamers creed.. FYI! I don't expect a reply.. Your preprogrammed bots don't know how to deal with genuine critism, nor do you care either",
        "A very amusing game. It has its flaws, but so do you! :-)  At least give it a try, you won't be dissapointed."

        "Love this game but when you are competing with SWGOH for mobile SW content I expect it to be better end game and more Special events. At lvl 8 and there's no more rewards or incentives , so I guess I'm done.   Also, As a busy person I have limited time to play and taking the entire game offline for maintenance, like right now is not a good way to keep me interested.  Dumb move devs.   Edit: good job with update but still need light and dark missions past level 7",
        "You should be matched with someone in your Tier, not 4 Tiers above you. When you play against fellow Guild Members you shouldn't have your levels edited. There should be an option to leave matches during the match. It doesn't make sense to lose because you had something else to do. And here's my biggest problem \"Oh hey, you won that match, here's 30 points.\" \"Oh you lost that match? Lemme just have 51 points from you.\" It also doesn't make sense to have heroes with blasters against melee heroes. They end up at a disadvantage.  Fot example, I was just matched with a level 3 Kylo Ren, as a level One Padme. Sooo fair.",
        "First the unbalance between the factions. Now the match making.. Are you folks fckng serious about it? Your matching a lvl 11 to 13 or 14? How could I win with my lvl 10 troops vs lvl 15 troops? No matter which side I play.. I have a lvl 3 hux and your great system matches me to a lvl 5 anakin with lvl 13 af walkers? Tell me this is a joke.",

I'm in tier 5 division 3, and for some reason it decides to pick a person from tier 7 division 2. Of course, I lost because it's unfair. Please sort this out.",
        "My favorite game on mobile right now. It's a mix between a MOBA(League of Legends)  and Clash Royale. You control a hero AND manually deploy different troops in your lane. I've never spent a dime and own all the heroes in game so it is not really pay to win at all. All around great game."

Need improvements on: 1) Some stages are not smooth graphics wise 2) Daily bonus gift does not increment.. Got the same bonus gift same as first day. 3) One of the site stage never completes after some time...it shows zombies arrival sign but no one come and need to exit the stage at the end. 4) Auto Relive after video for first two times has been removed. Want that feature.",

I can see my old progress on Google play games. I can also log in using my Google id. But I can't reload my previous saved data. I've tried everything possibly i could, but no use. I'm no longer owning my old device. What should I do. Please reply me with a genuine answer. The game automatically signs in to Google play but it isn't reloading the old file.",

        "The game is too BS. In mission 13, the recommended gun is 0 star shotgun and I have a 3 star shotgun and still the mission is on hard difficulty. Seriously? Use some common sense devs! Difficulty of the mission should decrease with increasing level/star of weapons. 🙅 EDIT: After so much frustration, I finally uninstalled it.",

After a week of playing the game and completing the quick action I was supposed to get 2800 gold. But it did not give me any gold so I wasted my time. It disappointed me. I want my gold that I deserve please. But other than that it is a decent game."

With the way it is now, there is no point to continue after losing a life. Make it so we have 3 tries before losing the ability of gathering mushrooms for 8 hours. Otherwise, good game.",
        "Game is fun enough, would be nice to not be sent back after losing a game. Gems need to be easier/more frequent to win in game as continuing on can count heavily on gems if you've had some bad luck with a board",

        "So far so good.  I have 75 dollars already. I just hate that if I don't complete puzzle that I go back a level and have to wait 8 hours before I can collect more mushrooms. But game is fun and addicting",
        "I wish it didn't lock you out from earning on the first life or that it didn't take you back to lower levels in the game on first failed life. I think it would get all stars if it change the lock out and level drop after you lost the third life. Just a thought.",
        "It's a fun game just like all matching games. Winning prizes is a bonus, but haven't gotten to that yet. Maybe if the 8 hour wait was cut down to half. Also..\"eating\" a mushroom every six minutes? Really? At least not while collection is active! Not right either way.."

        "Most missions are 1 to 8 hours long leaving you bored and playing other games. Want to do ANYTHING, it'll take real money but gives you nothing in return. Now events keep expanding and back to back. Only way to advance is money. Went from pay to play to cash cow. They have terrible customer service and just ignore emails and they rigged the game so some missions you have to buy things with real money. And they actually punish good players and there is zero recourse.",
        "It is an entertaining game. The latest update won't let me play the game. It states there's an error with the map and to reload again. 24hrs now and I still can't play it. Also very very jumpy and takes a  good few minutes before it takes action and that was before this update. It looks cool and is more interactive but so much slower and frustrating.  Otherwise it would be PRIMO. Just not quite there yet.",
        "My first game glitched and didn't load the free black widow quest, or the black panther event at level six. Be careful about buying buildings you don't need yet, I had no way to buy Club A and had to start over.",
        "Too expensive at times to get the best rewards and all the goals. Love the concept and game play. Some adventures take a bit long.  Used to love this game. Have spent a fortune on it. Since the upgrade hate the gameplay....not that I can play anymore. Since the hulk event the game comes up and then crashes.  Give me my thousands of dollars and hours of time back, since it's now useless to me.",
        "After recent update game is not starting. As it is not working just uninstalled. Installed game as new event has started. I thought developers sorted out the issue. But after starting the game it downloads around 500mb data and stopped working. Wow what a beautiful new event.after new update & bug fix still game not opening.23 March still app is not working.",
        "So, a lot of problems have been fixed and now it's actually enjoyable and fun to play again. Thank you very much. Just a thing left to change, please lower the price for Ranking a character to 5, 20000 credits are hard to get, maybe 10000, or 15000 as well. 😀"

        "Cons: The character movement in battle (i.e shooting X-bow, swinging, glaives, swords etc) is just a loop. 1 combo set of moves for each weapon. Game WILL freeze and close once every now and again. No live pvp.  Pros: 94 different solo story missions. The rewards system (chests, gems, etc.) is well developed. \"Dwarven Forge\" is a live 4 player co-op mini-game that is really fun and seems to run smoothly which is great because it's the only part you can play with other live players.",
        "this game has lost its standing every update is causing more issues! I can't participate in gold wares cause I instantly crash... I have lost at least 145 morale and over 200 gems... and they never refund the full amount! they only refund about half!  stop creating new features fix the stupid crashes...  I am a vip7 and was considering to go vip8... but so don't want to till they fix the dang crashes!",
        "I play this game about everyday just to get the legendary chest. My only compliant about this is last month I was due a legendary chest and on 02/28/18 when I went in to get my chest it was in March already,  What the heck is up with that. Spend all that time going into the game and no legendary chest,  is this on purpose or a glitch? I hope it doesn't happen this month again.",
        "I previously rated this game 1 star. With the new updated version game play is exceptional.  The coop mode can suck depending on others and their network speeds.  If you want to get powefull fast you can buy you way there or grind it out.  I prefer the gind as I play just an hour or two at night. Lol.  Fun game.",
        "Not as good as DH4. Only one class of characters to play as. Lots of more side things, but most are not worth the time. Direction of how to do some things are lacking, so you're left to feel around in the dark a bit. There seems to be an update every couple days which is kind of annoying.",
        "I could not finish the introduction because of multiple game crashes. I just deleted one of your other games because of the same unreliability with your servers. This seems to be an unfortunate pattern with Gameloft games. I will avoid any product you create moving forward. Pity."

        "This is the best skate game in the app store. I honestly think it's the best skate game I've ever played including skate games by ea on console. Super realistic physics that allow amazing freedom of the tricks you do. There is no magnetic rail grind system which is awesome. Nothing is handed to you, you have to work at it. There's a high learning curve but it's the same in real skateboarding. If you want an experience that is similar to skateboarding this is it. Definitely my favorite game on the app store by far. P.s. on the off chance a developer reads this, please add more manual pads. I love manuals in this game, I hope they stay the same in any updates or sequels to this game.",
        "Continuously resets my credits, logs me out of my Google account randomly when I launch game and makes my credit score 0 when I log back in. I keep having to download all my maps again and starting at 0 credits. It's getting annoying. I've lost well over 100k total.",
        "It's 2.99 but yet you have to pay for customization and new maps. You start with a blank skateboard and one skate map. If this was released to console with how much you have to pay, that would be the downfall of this game. It's a great game but I tf s very money hungry with the in game pay",
        "Should have made a free version because paying money for a game which offers us content equal to what a free version would is absolutely stupid. What a dumb decision, like who genuinely thought \"Hey, let's make a game people pay for, but have to pay even more money just for extra content which should be free!\" Game developers like YOU make me sick! 😑 gah, why don't you just grow up 😑",
        "This game was a solid 5 stars until I updated either the game or my software. It used to open and run in milisecconds. Now it just shows a blank screen. No matter how long I leave it for.  Will rate 5 when fixed as it is a amazing game (one plus 5t)",
        "This is the best mobile game ever, period. But it f-in stopped working after official oreo update on oneplus 5 and i am gonna go nuts soon. I need this i am f-in addicted! Devs! Help!!!"

        "Cost of everything in the game is particularly high. And gems??? Don't even get me started.  They just dropped some limited time dragons in the game, and the cost of EACH them is OVER $100 if you haven't been able to earn that many gems in game yet.  Which takes a very, very long time.  Uninstalling today, casual players beware.",
        "Very relaxing game. I wouldn't say it's a \"time killer\" because after playing for hours you'd probably spend a lot of cash out of your pocket, if you don't want to pay this game calls for lots of patience. If you have PATIENCE you will NOT have to buy anything. I've been playing for almost 2 years now and I have only spent 30$ on the game and not because I felt like i had to but because I just wanted to; to speed the game play up a bit. I have gotten every dragon so far, even the event dragons, and limited time dragons, etc. Without  having to spend any gems. Sometimes it takes days of breeding the same pair but it will work if your persistent and patient! :)",
        "Concept-wise the same as with many breeding games. It's fun, a nice game to have for here and there.  Generally good ideas were implemented into this game. Most dragon designs are really good. Unfortunately I don't understand some of the mechanics in the game like removing something from the market makes you lose this item? I mean the last time I have opened a market on the street, I kept my things I put for sale. :? Please fix those logic flaws.",
        "It's fun enough if you don't take it too serious. I could write a long review but I was in the middle of playing when the game kept asking for a review, kind of annoying. But in all honesty this is one of two games I have consistently played for a long time now, so I really do like it.",
        "I really love this game...i have this one and the other DragonVale. I have alot of fun with my grandkids breeding the different dragons. I will say tho that I would have given this 5 stars all the way across if it didn't take so long to get some of the dragons. We have been trying for the Knarr dragon for months and can not get it. It is very frustrating. If it wasn't for the new events that give us a chance to breed new dragons I am afraid I would have uninstalled this due to it taking wayyyyyyy to long to breed certain dragons.",
        "I've been playing this game for a LONG time. And it continues to keep my interest! It's so fun! And with the constant release of new dragons and events, it stays fun. I wish there were more events, but Hey! It's a great game! Expand that market place though..."

You guys always claim how much you appreciate your players, why not show your appreciation by increasing the number of spins a player can win from 5 to 8, 8 to 10 and so on. Now that would be a great update  (without making it more difficult to win free spins) that all players would appreciate & it will make your game more fun to play. Knew U wouldn't respond.",

        "Here's something cool that happened on plant island:it was toowa bomm time and I heard Potbelly's voice!!it happens when I was reading rare maw's bio.I have zero gems right now!it needs another way to get diamonds than just money and scratch tickets that only give you one diamond at a time! Here's an idea:when monster lvl 10,they give you diamonds!(I'm saying this because I have a maw that's at lvl 11)bring one element ethreals' price down to 500 dimonds or 100 purple thingies,bring wubbox price down to 5,000,000 coins. Pls bring these updates soon!one time when I was making a composer with thumpies and it sounded like there was sneyser in backround!(from dawn of fire)oh my goodness I just visited Elle 100+ only's ethreal I love this update!!!!!(It's not Derek rating this I'm his son rating this)(Daniel is my name this is my dad's account)",
        "OH MASTERPIECE! This is the best look-after-your-stuff game IN THE WORLD! but why do you make it so hard to get wubbox? I've been saving for like two weeks now and I'm just bored of not spending anything. Please make it so wubbox I'd less expensive.",
        "This is the SECOND time I have been screwed over. The first time. I watched an ad so I can get a free ticket. Only for the ad to take me to the app store and close my game. I DIDN'T GET A TICKET IMAGINE THAT. And just now I COMPLETED an offer for kobo audio book to get 178 diamond. As soon as I was done? \"This offer is no longer available\" EXCUSE ME YOU BUNCH OF SPECKY CRACK HEADS",
        "My Singing monsters is awesome but I think it needs to have the Fire Monsters & have a special tower that lets the Plant, Cold, Air, Water or Earth Islands have the Natural element monsters that aren't in it join the song & make it longer. Please do, also please make the new Weirdo on Air Island have a Male voice & call it Strangara. Please make the new Weirdo on Water Island have a female voice & call it Singshell. Thanks! & MSM & DOF are awesome!",

        "This is by far my favorite game. I love how entertaining it is, but i hit two jackpots and never got my.money soo thats very very frustrating...i should have a trillion dollars but because i was rooked out of my jackpot wins i honestly may uninstall. I emailed them about it and no one ever got back to me...this is sad because i really love this game. Oh well.",
        "Well ive played for such along time but ive never got the top money on the spin wheel ever and on the spin wheel you have multiple amounts the same dollar figure so you end up landing on one of the same dollar amounts , you need to give us better odds right there.  So i give a 51% pass mark because of those reasons only. PS - CHANGE ALL THE DOLLAR FIGURES ON THE MONEY WHEEL AND EVERY SO OFTEN LET US WIN THE MAJOR DOLLAR ON IT . CAUSE AT ATM YOU NEVER WIN IT.",
        "I just I absolutely love this game. I find it very challenging and both rewarding and exciting. Would love (naturally higher wheel Spins.) Never hurts to ask. Top of my favourites ,daily plays.   Trying very very hard to quit before my chips are gone. Ahead right now and will try to conserve for another time. Will be telling others about this Casino styled game that I enjoy immensely. Just Love this game. Spectacular!!!!!!!!!      y",
        "Why do you bother having 7s on the reel if they never come up. Would live to have fun playing your slots but you only know how to take back any win you ever give long before the fun starts.",
        "Great lot of slots colorful when i was on a winning streak i was on 🔥 but the more i played the higher I bet but instead of staying on 1 machine i bunny hopped around & sn my Billion's sn dwindled but i still enjoy playing so download it & find out 4 yourself today.😇😎",
        "After I gave a good rating, I lost all my credits of a billion coins! Stupid"

The controls aren't quite as accurate to actual touch locations as I'd like, but other than that, this is a lot of fun. The original game, Black and White, was great!!! And this is to. Different features to the game, but that, too, is to be expected. You can choose to watch ads to aid your progress, but they are not intrusive, which I appreciate greatly. The game really isn't challenging in the beginning, but I haven't gotten far. This is totally worth the download. Great, great job devs, thanks for all the hard work!!!!",

I do wish there was more information available on how to increase the happiness of your followers... as it seems that no matter how much you build and gift and inspire they are always behind the Astari! A little work in developing a help section would go a long way! And some more diverse purchase packages would make it more appealing to pay!",
        "This is the best game I've downloaded from the playstore, ever. It doesn't bombard you with ads and you get sooo much content! You even have the option to watch an unlimited number of ads for free gems if you so choose, and gem costs for items are totally reasonable. The story is cute and interesting and the graphics are pleasing. The controls are also very user friendly. It's been like three weeks and I'm still addicted. Superb work guys!!",
        "This game is mesmerising. The graphics seem simple, but they are so elegant and beautiful. The background music is good too. Edit: I got addicted to the game, and that cause its a game that absorbs you in. I had previously rated it 5 stars but now, the game won't open at all. It stops working every time, is all my progress lost now?",
        "Was looking for a settlers type game when I found this.I love it. It is a calm and addictive game. Love the story boxes ,I can't wait to complete the story, (I bet mrcreepypasta on YouTube would knock a narration out the park). Really enjoy the landscaping element, just waiting on the seabed ability now. Only bugbear I have is stickers seem to be very difficult to obtain. It seems boxes are few and far between once grey cleared areas have been checked.",
        "Seems like it could be a cool game. Didn't mind the ads until they started just playing the sound on a black screen. Timer runs out and no x to continue. I restart the app but I have to get past an ad to open a pretty important menu. (Galaxy note 8)"

        "Incredible mobile game, even for older gamers! Incredible mobile game, one of the first fully realized AAA titles on Android.  No stupid IAP, micro-transactions or paywalls after initial purchase.  Vast, procedurally-generated worlds with numerous biomes and biome-specific items, bosses and events, making for great replayability.  A deep, relaxing game of crafting and building OR a PVE game OR multiplayer. Even has a great tutorial and cloud save to sync across devices.  Playing on Nexus 6p and I have no problems with controls, even as an older gamer.",
        "Hey,  so this is gonna longish review... what I have to say about this is while  it is similar to Minecraft in the way that it is open world it is a completely different game. It has the graphics of your old 16 bit Dungeon Crawler games in a huge and immersive environment that is always changing. As a PC player of the game I can say that I am pleased with the port over onto mobile devices. I wouldn't ask for anything different!",
        "PLEASE Fix it. First I Love this game, only I can't access the game online. No cloud saves, no multiplayer, I got this to play with my son and so my kids can play together. Would love to give the app full star's, please fix this so that I can. All that asides its still a lot of fun, still recommend this highly. Just got to update what I said, now I can't even access the game. All the gear that I've made/found is gone if I have to reinstall. If I didn't like the game I wouldn't mind but I do, so it's only disappointed me more. PLEASE fix this so that I can play this awesome game with my son before I fined another great game we can play together on our phones. Maybe I'll start with that minecraft game he's going on about.......",
        "Great game, and enjoyable by whole family on local multiplayer. Terraria PE has come a long way since its early days. Waiting for new updates. The only issue I've seen is that for some reason 360 Security flags this as a trojan malware possibly due to so many access permissions that Terraria asks for. Devs this is something you may want to clear with them. Otherwise keep up the good work.",
        "I LOVE the game but you need more bosses And wepons that you can forge together to get unique wepons and armor (like say you want the special effect from one armor set but you want the def fom another you could forge then together and get the special effect and the def). You also might want to add a extremely hard boss like duke fishron, but lots of them! It would add so much play time onto the game, but you would like i said earlier new armor add tools.",
        "I've played this game since elementary school till now, I'm still fall in love playing this game. Even though sometimes it gets salty when you lose something or the bug, but... Idfc =D. For the devs, could you add more stuff from PC to this mobile version ? It'll be cool to have chimney and other good looking decorations for the house"

        "The only problem I have about this game is the time limit for some reason I don't understand why you have 60 seconds to do as much matching characters of this game to me it doesn't make sense I think they should just let you have like 10 times or 15 times to match your characters on the board instead of giving you a time limit to me that does not make any sense especially when you have to find three matching characters or at least find a roll of characters that you can match I think they need to get rid of time limit and I think this game will be a lot better and on top of that I think I need to add more Disney characters from TV shows",

        "This game is better and more fun than any game that I have ever played. This game is so absolutely beautiful. It's dramatic because of the sound within it. And the music after you beat a level with 3 stars, amazing. I have never played such a marvelous game. Different features make it more fun (I won't tell, you will have to see for yourself), and you don't have to buy the things that give you more power, like the hammer. You create them in a lab. So this game can cost you zero. Nobody has ever created the perfect game....until now. Applause, applause, applause, and a standing ovation. You folks did it.",
        "Like that when I  get stuck on a level I can play the challenges as an alternative. Took me a while to figure out I could get special jewels without using my points or paying. Glad I can watch ads by choice to earn extra time or speed up special power creation. I'm hooked!",
        "Love this game I'm on level 800, some levels can be a bit difficult, but certainly not unobtainable after some strategic planning and a few extra tries.  The only thing I don't like is when you know the answer for the daily riddle but don't have the emoji to choose, that's when I pick the pile of s**t, I know it's incorrect, but I like to see the stern reaction from the character asking the question.  Decent graphics, never lags.",
        "The music in the background is horrible. Plz change it. Otherwise I would have given a higher rating.",
        "I still play though the game has changed. Sad,thing is when a game designer falls back on mathematical imposibilities to substitute for a difficulty level. King does the same thing. Maybe that's part of the marketing to get us to buy the extra boosters to win more levels. I gave it a 4",
        "High quality and amazing challenges! The audio acts up when I play it through Bluetooth but other than that the game runs smoothly!"

        "The graphic are great and the gameplay is fun but what kept me going was the writing. At first I was like uhhh another newspaper? Those don't do anything... But I kept reading and they are GREAT. On the lower side, the drones often clip in building and can't be clicked or you click straight on it but get sent to a building screen instead and by the time you get back, the fast drones are gone.",
        "Soul eggs are incredibly buggy. On the higher level eggs you can go from earning 10s a sec to 1 a sec just by closing the app. The extra soul eggs through epic research when you prestige isn't clear enough and doesn't match the description. Later game is very much about waiting for a counter to hit one billion which means you don't need to open the app all that much. Other than that, it's ok.",
        "Very good game overall, relaxing and good to play if you have a short period of free time. The only thing I would say is I wish opening the piggy bank didn't cost REAL money because I have thousands of golden eggs in it but I can't get them out because I don't want to spend money. Maybe make it that you have to spend TONS of the in-game money to open it. I would rate this 4/5 stars, as I thoroughly enjoy it.",
        "Great stuff, cool graphics and awesome story writing. A nice time passing game. Would have given 5 stars if a little more improvement was made. Bug - When you tap on the box when it is being thrown by the courier van, the dialog shifts up to the to of the screen, overlapping the cash counter. Suggestion - The whole farm area should be easily scrollable. Also, you could put in an option to zoom out to fit the whole farm on the screen.",
        "I play the game all the time, but it needs easier and faster prestige. Three days of waiting for the next egg is bs with a prestige score of almost 1,000,000. Also \"silos\" hardly earn anything. That's my main complaint. Fix it so they earn WAY more over non play or I'm done and I've actually spent money so if you still want that, fix it.",
        "Fun and simple game that lets you gradually grow your farm at your own speed. This is a game you can play from once a week where you collect the money you've collected offline, buy upgrades, then leave the game for another week; to spending a few casual hours of hunting for the drones that give you extra money and gold eggs which are the games micro-transaction currency to buy permanent upgrades that help your farm grow faster. It not so much a race as it is just enjoying your farm steadily grow over time."

        "I have a question. I have a tablet and a phone, i want to play on my phone with stuff that i have on my tablet. On tablet i am loged in with a google paly account, when i login to same account on my phone it doesnt ask me to download other chapters and i dont have any items or achivements. Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",
        "Not the master. But I had got with the achievement \"thaught the teacher\". After defeating hermit now I am used to magic. Only in few minutes I can earn money and upgrade\u200b my gear. Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won't even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it."

All they want is for you to start sending your real money to buy their play money. The daily bonus on this game is pathetic. If you collect the daily bonus every day and save up for a month straight, you would probably be able to play for an hour or so.... That's If you keep your bets small.",

        "Finally a mobile mmo that actually feels like a real mmorpg. Nice graphics, skills, open world questing, lots of players. Fights are engaging  and boss fights are spectacular and interactive. You do need a team for dungeons and raids as you can't just 1 shot everything, like in other mobile mmos. I've tried loads but this is the best by far! Keep it up!",
        "Man, this is a perfect 5/7! Out of a crapton of Mu Origin game clones, this is even better than original! Polished graphics, nice player skills set, awesome UI items layout - everything is top notch! The only thing I can wish for is adding camera turn on top of player strafe via joystick. Thanks for the hard work, and please keep it up!",
        "Great mobile MMO! Good graphics and narration so the story stays interesting. Additionally...SO much Co-op and PvP and a lot of things to give an edge. Not P2P dominated either so far. Obviously the grind to 55 is tough but I have a few characters on different servers there still very possible.",
        "I think this game is amazing for an MMO mobile. It has a feeling of blade and soul and WOW and the graphics sre amazing on my Razer phone! Actually feels like a real MMO, and I like that there are character voices.  Only problem I am having is whenever I go to turn the Volume up or down all sound cuts out and won't come back on until i restart the game. So I need to pre-set my volume before launching the game and then not touch the volume while playing.",
        "I'm furious.  First you guys fix the Android problem. Now I run thru the update and a screen pops up that I need to relaunch game because it's out of date. How when I literally JUST watched it update? I've spent a lot of time on this game and really like it but if I can't even get to the character select screen, why would I keep it on my phone. It's a shame, it really is.",
        "Could not even start playing. At the start screen the audio is pushing and choppy. This persisted into the game itself, turning off the music did not help, though turning off all sound did. Not playing this type of game without sound. I have a Note 8, so a top of the pine phone, so it's not me running  a phone that can't handle this type of game"

        "This game is amazing. It has GREAT graphic quality, AMAZING game mechanics, and one of the BEST multiplayer trade systems I've ever seen in a game. BUT the support and appeals system is terrible. I've been contacting appeals for 2 weeks about my accidental ban with no reply I've spent well over 800 bucks so I'm not sure what to do now.",
        "Such an amazing game. Been playing since 2013 and loved every bit of it. There's still some work to be done with the whole system. An event that happened on 20/1/2018 my clans banks (Biggest bank on arawn- Braves and resurgence) had there passwords changed by an ex resurgence general. Chief of resurgence got it back then on the 20th OTM gave it back to the scammer! That me me furious. Otherwise the game is great.",
        "If you are into getting better equipment all the time, then this can get boring quick... I was loving it at first but getting better equipment is based SOLEY on npc merchants and quests... Theres fishing and cooking, but you cannot make gear.. No magic item drops... The equipment system in this is very linear..",
        "Dissapointed. One thumb mobile are terrible at getting issues resolved. Recently there's been a duping scandal where many innocent people have been caught in the cross fire, including clan banks stocked with several years of raid spoils. How they don't have measures in place to deal with these kinds of issues is beyond me.",
        "I only just started, and the games itself is wicked cool, but even after the tutorial, I just can't figure out how to use the player chat. It sort of glitches out and won't let my type anything. Is this a game problem, or a mistake on my part?",
        "I usually don't do reviews, but this game definently deserves it! Easy to pick up and get sucked into. Good amount of classes to choose from and customization is very refined. And finally, an mmorpg that doesn't contain a bunch of anime freak characters and outrageous weapons and armor. Such an enjoyable game."

        "Brings Back Fond Memories I love this game! I spent countless hours playing this in the early 2000s. The controls are easy enough to understand and the text is legible on my LG V10. I don't if I'd be able to read it on a smaller screen, they are not kidding when they say this is meant for tablets. If you've got a tablet or phablet I can't recommend this game enough.",
        "A classic perfectly adapted to the phone platform This game is a MUST-have for any rpg lover. The D&D mechanics may seem i bit weird in the beginning, but you will learn in time. The replayability value of this game is almost infinite. Personally I have never played any kind of game that would allow me to play as many hours in so many different ways. The game excels in its easy to handle mechanics, fun dialogue, compelling story, great ammount of side-quests that are actually enjoyable. Hands down best Apk for this platform. Worth every penny.",
        "Great Classic CRPG BGII was definitely a breakthrough in its time, but it still holds charm and depth that many newer games can't even touch. I have this game for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and I can tell the chip set on the phone is grinding gears with the games engine. It's playable but only when the right character menu is minimized but it still gets choppy when multiple spells are being  cast. With the specs on the s7 this shouldn't be the case. Hey Developers any input/ advice on how to solve this issue?",
        "Amazing! There's a lot to love.  First, if you played the original, this is just as good with extras.  Granted, it's a bit harder to see everything, but it's what happens when you take a computer game and make it available for a phone.  Beamdog has brought additional characters, adventures, magic items, portraits and voices to the game to expand the character creation.  Some expansions are dull (like the arena unless you love grinding) but more of this rpg is on the way.  It's truly the best classic game reborn.",
        "I have a special request. I have purchased very possible version of the bg series, and have played as long as the game has existed. Call me a war vet asking for a wheel chair ramp but could you guys implement the imput of  points or the option to roll. 20+ years of rolling for stats has earnt me the option. Other than that perfect game, worth every licence for every platform. Either let us input stats with option to roll or make a shadowkeeper for android please.",
        "Game is great, as I've played it on another device. However on Note 8 it does not take up the whole screen, and the usable screen is significantly smaller than on s7 edge, and is barely playable. When I force it to full screen in settings, then touching on sides of screen are not recorded accurately. For example, when I try to resize the text box, it toggles AI instead. Makes the game virtually unpayable."

        "Addicting but not worth it. Everywhere in the game there are a bunch of Russian POS hackers. You can have a fully upgraded Battleship and a little tiny Destroyer or frigate will come along and one shot it with a main cannon from half the map away. This should not be possible. I tried using fully upgraded versions of Destroyers and frigates and I couldn't even scratch a normal battleship. As long as the Russian POS hackers aren't playing this game it's not worth it.",
        "Amazing game if you like naval warships. UPDATE: As of Feb 17 2018, the new update has seriously increased the game content and fun level. UPDATE as of Feb 27 2018, Lowered my rating to 4 stars because there is a constant issue with the timers or something like that.  I login and collect the crate and start a module upgrading then login several hours late and is like no time elapsed in the game from the last time I logged in. This has happened several times in the past as well.",
        "Best battleship game on Android hands down ! Better than wargaming ship game great controls great graphics !Fun to play good selection of warships and large maps and they keep on doing updates to keep it interesting! And the most important thing is the price of ships are fair keep up the great work . I love the last update with graphics and maps and ships. the only thing the Bismarck is under powered can you make her stronger because she was the pride of Germany and everybody complains she is not a good ship.She is a powerhouse thank you!",
        "Definitely a good game and worth your time and money. Only issue that developers really need to attend to is how they select the team. You can't have 7 ships of high ranks against 5 or 4 ships of low rank. It makes a person want to delete the game even after spending money on it. Keep same ranked players together in a battle. Really irritating.",
        "Fact need a good connection to keep control of your ships Now, I have plenty of $$$ nothing to spend on it. Waiting to get the last max destroyer ship i can get on the random container spin.  Also noted... I open up the app the next day and the container count down says 2+ hours. It should read 0 zero I would think.",
        "This game is unbelievable! I wish that I knew about it a lot sooner. I love how the game was made for online use, but the offline bots you get to play without internet are just like real people! A good tip for new users though, you should turn off your WiFi to play with the bots. You'll fair better then. Also, I wanted to ask how we could change our nicknames? I'm just itching to do it!"
