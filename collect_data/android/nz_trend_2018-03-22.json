        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Good game but I expected it to be the best.  No loading issues or bugs encountered so far. Game loading takes about 6 seconds so no big deal. If madfinger sees this please add new maps and skins and weapons in SGDZ and enhance the game experience at FB as playing the game at gameroom sucks. I promise I will bring you about 100 new players if you did that.",
        "This is a really fun game, doing missions are entertaining, animations are really good. But the only problem is that some of the actions don't work properly.  Now what I am saying is that sometimes there are levels where you have to open doors by doing the action, kicking objects down to continue, but sometimes the door won't work. I know this is the first version so that doesn't \"BUG\" me.",
        "This game has little bit inspiration from many big games like destiny (duh), titanfall, doom. The game does have similarities to dead trigger. All the random loot is cosmetic, guns are easily obtained through missions. Good performance on my S7, but need internet 24×7 to run, even during campaign.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks.",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins."

        "Smooth controls and gameplay. No glitching. Amazing graphics. Running on Samsung Note 8 with the latest updates and no other apps running in the background. Kinda reminds me of Battlefield 3... :)   One thing I don't like is the option to either play as a Guest or sign in using Facebook. Not everyone has a Facebook and it would make me want to play it more if I could sign up using my email account etc. Just my 2 cents. Enjoy!",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "This game is amazing. I've only ever played on mobile since it's hard to find time to play video games. I fell in love within the first game. This mobile version is so good especially being an early release. It only takes up 205mb of storage and runs amazing even on my Honor 7x which is a great phone but is known to be not the best with higher end gaming. I'm very impressed with this game and I'll keep playing it!",
        "The devs have proved that clones can never even come close to the real stuff, this game is the BEST and it has murdered its clones! From awesome graphics to its high stability, the devs have done a fabulous job and has put in a lot of effort into this masterpiece! Thank you for this port devs as my pc cant run the pc version of pubg because of its low specs and im a big fan of this game, you guys have made it possible for me to finally experience this awesomness! Thank you each and every member of your team Tencent games! Thank you!"

It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The Sims keeps progressive challenges fun and interesting, and the Club Wars make for a very fun multiplayer experience!  The graphic attention to detail is amazing! It's quite relax just to watch the shadows of the skyline stretch as the sun crosses the sky or to see hot air balloons floating around the metropolis.  This game is lots of fun!!"

        "Horrible forced tutorial. Your game isn't so complex it needs a 20m tutorial. God I hate games like this. Why won't you just SHUT UP AND LET US PLAY THE GAME. When we go to the arcade there isn't this absurd tutorial telling us every bit of the game. Were not morons! I swear to god, \"Stage 5\" and its still got some girl wearing a ridiculous outfit telling me how to play some easy game that thinks its deeper than it is. I thought this was going to be a modern Afterburner. But nope! Fat chance of that. Afterburner doesn't think were stupid. We sat in the seat and took off from the carrier and shot down planes. You disrespect us with this kind of treatment. It's left a terrible taste and I cannot recommend this to anyone. Your main character is narcissistic and ridiculous and do you guys really get a feeling of manliness being told what to do by a woman wearing that? She might as well fly the plane for you!! She obviously knows how!",

It would help us be less grindy. It would help with collection and able to get legendary easier plus monthly revenue. I would love that. Compare to MFF which is a lot more hectic, you guys a bit more generous. Just please don't put any paywall characters. Hated that.",
        "Fun game but currency is insanely expensive. I don't mind spending money but this game is ridiculous. So instead of me spending a little I spend nothing. I guess my wallet thanks you. It's also so hard to level people up... They keep introducing new characters I have to level up to keep up with alliance missions. Those are fun but I want to level up my other characters too!",
        "It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.",
        "Agreed that DS needs reworking but not frm one of the best to the weakest. Developers, do you even play your own game?? Wasted my $$ & time invested in him. I don't even have lobo if you think I use the 'lowbo' combination in pvp",
        "Upgrade superman please, he is so weak.. i  have Lvl 52 Superman with Lvl 7 gear but his overall is still lower than Lvl 50 Cyborg, Power Girl or even Jessica Cruz with Lvl 4 gear. He is the weakest energy character even though i invest a lot on him.",
        "Pretty good turn based strategy. Wish should some things were explained a bit better, especially buffs and debuffs. Also feel like progress stalls as the game gets fun... Higher energy caps or lower energy drain per mission would be nice."

        "It was enjoyable before the latest update, and the new features look interesting and will make the game better, but there's now a glitch with actually playing? Whenever I hit the ball, I receive some gems and go the distance that would take me two bounces in a matter of seconds before it resets and I'm back at the start. Thought it may have been just a one-off but it seems consistent. Hoping the developers can fix this soon.",
        "Great to use when you're on a quick break. However, the new update needs some more updates. I like how the ball flies faster... But now it's too fast to try and strategically bounce it @ end of flying. Maybe slow it down then. Also, first hit when I open is fine, all hits after, the screen goes black halfway through flying in the air...",
        "Fun game. I would like to see an update that includes sounds effects, music etc. I would also like to see different characters to choose from and/or customization of the character(s). Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I like the game a lot and have been playing it for around a month. The new  update looks and cool and fun and I like the new features and character and stuff but I can only open the game and hit the ball once or twice before this glitch that starts happening. The glitch is that it will go the distance then reset and I won't get credit for going that for or get any money. Please fix fast and keep up with the updates",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "It was fun up until the last update when the developers I assume said \"hey! If we make the ball move faster, we can squeeze more ads in\". The game itself is very fun, however, once you get onto it, you are practically forced to turn your internet off. Things to improve on: change the ball speed back to normal, and make ads more spanned out."

Now there is an energy system and you start from ground zero, mindlessly and limitedly trying to catch up to enemies that could prove a challenge. The battlemap should have been added in addition to the game's previous setup, not replaced it. I will not play until this is fixed.",

I was glad to see my progretion was the same same with new things too do that's always good . Was good to see a quest tree to beat that uses stanama to play fair anuf , gets you back playing it.   But why is endless been removed and replaced with a endless mode that go's through one wave then ends not very endless , that also needs stanama to play that's kind of a buzz kill .  It is a Great update but I would like to see the old game's endless mode to return . Its the part that I fell in love with this great game .",
        "Update sucks original game id play for hours now it seems game makers realized they had a great game so they put the stupid energy restrictions on it so you can only play so much and took away the reset to get enhance stones ive literally been playing hours at a time to get 3 star towers takes forever to gather gems now for nothing since you can only play 1 wave a time for 5 energy .... Id go up to wave 700 by playing all day in short was great game update ruined it better idea would have been made a diff game with all the changes they wanted to make",

Thank you creators for this masterpiece you are sharing with us!!",
        "**Pros** Love the game and like the puzzles. They keep you entertained and therefore I bought the premium version. Helps with beating boring long train rides. **Cons** After buying premium, ads still auto-start when playing the slots. I bought the premium version to get rid of those!!! Moreover, the energy refills and premium tickets remain as prizes within the slot machine, while you have unlimited access to both 😑 Moreover, you cannot reset your game data. Aka: Do not spend money on this game",

        "I tried the beta and loved it, with my main hope for a way which you can backup your game so I don't have to worry about losing my progress. The developers came through and enabled CloudSave. I already love everything about this game and the addition of that meant and immediate 5 stars from me. Additional plus points for the cute games and being able to toggle whether you want poop.",
        "I love this game. I loved the first game a lot but was always super sad it didn't have a save function. But this one does! So you can save your progress with no problem. And there's so many areas of the house to fill up with stolen goodies. This game is awesome. 100% recommended!",
        "Really like this game however. It's been taking big amounts of coins off me in the past few days? I've purchased some of the coins etc. I leave the game with 2000+ coins to return to 800 this morning? I had the same thing a few days ago but thought I must've pressed some buttons wrong. But since it happened again, am not impressed with this. I've paid money for coins which are going missing? Shame cause its a fun game.",
        "I was so excited for this game since the first one is so fun. Sadly, this seems like it was made as a cash grab. Merely riding on the success of the last one, but changing a lot of the mechanics. For one, it costs more to bring the cats back, and it's more difficult to obtain coins. Also, forget about kiips unless you're willing to spend money, because they even changed the system of trading coins in for kiips, costing you more coins for each kiip you obtain via buying with coins. So if you're okay with all of that, it still has cute cats, fun little items to collect, and new rooms.",
        "It is cute and likeable. Love the YouTube video on the backstory. The cost sending the Klepto Cats Out is a little steep with the amount you make. Feeding, petting and bathing seems to do nothing. Having arthritic hands playing the games is bit difficult. Also why do you get dust cloud when tapping on something?",
        "I miss being able to send out one cat per room (like you could in original Kleptocats) now you have to pay 100 coins to send more than one out (even if the cat is in a different room). It's also harder to get gems as you can't trade coins for them now and you only get one per day from the 'gem dog'. Hopefully this will improve with future updates as I've seen others complain about these mechanics too."

        "I love the game its really fun, but the overall game progression is a super grind. I'm only on chapter 3 and I spend more time enhancing my mech with fooder, that mind you doesnt scale up with rank. The exp you have to put in goes up but not the exp you get from C to A rank mechs is pretty much the same unless it's an enhanced mech and those are super rare after the daily mission is used up.",
        "Really impressed with the quality. Even some voice acting in it. More pervy than I expected, but makes me laugh sometimes. Only gave 4 stars because it's a gatcha type of microtransaction game, and I will never give a game like that a perfect score.",
        "The last maintenance fixed the lagging issue thx for the great work  I just started playing it but my impression are positive  I think sounds takes a big cut from  game size and only one male char.  Appeared until now, overall i think it will be a big success, thx",
        "Turn base game. The mech from C rank can easily promote to the last S rank within 3 days of grinding. Other thing that I like about this game is the Pixie's episode. I really thought I get the correct answer and they gave me a long cut scene. End up it was wrong. I was surprised. Yup there is fan service",
        "Finally a good mecha-themed turn base rpg game I can actually enjoy. Cute graphics, awesome mecha designs, cringe-worthy fan services (which I am a sucker of), all in one nicely packaged mobile game. Thank you Nexon for presenting us with this gem 😊",
        "Game is over 2GB! But dl doesn't indicate that. Only installing the opening. Way to big for a mobile game. What a waste"

The only thing you could get was a skin that is 10000 dollars. It's is very hard to get any money. The only good thing was the graphics and the audio.",

But other that it's great though it would also be nice if characters were cheaper and you could buy accessories with no effects."

That's not even hiding at all. Also the health taken down when shooting wrong boject should be 1 and remove auto-shoot. Make it easier to hit props and remove the frigging emoji above the props.  This is more like a running simulator.",

        "Damn you, Tony, this was way more addictive than I was expecting. Especially loved the hints. Might be cool if you introduce different sound effects for the different saws. Also, please keep the beard. Loved it in the older videos.",
        "This, in my opinion, is the nest of this genre of mobile game. Smooth controls and animations, with simple enough gameplay to enjoy, while also continuing to entertain the player. I love how this game is completely free to play, and there have been no issues that I have seen out of the time I played it. Well done, Tony!",

They stayed in contact, gave a time that an update should be in place, and even compensated me with a nice sorry for the inconveniences package. Which I wasn't expecting or requesting in anyway. So great game and better customer support than most other mobile developers",

For example I had 2 ascended points put them into damage reset it and got 20000 back. Gotta fix that. Over all it's a really fun game",

If you lock a specific item it still allows you to sell it with no notice. Overall a decent game that has too much to offer up too early.",

I'm about an hour into grinding and have only been forced to watch one 30 second ad but you have the option to watch a few more for items or perks. No bugs seen yet. I got a little happier when I left the game on and my lil hero's went into the dungeon without me.",

        "Love this game.  Once of the best made games I've ever played, with an amazing concept and exceptionally executed. One thing I think should be changed is the \"infinite resources\" mode. It does not give you infinite resources,  it gives you 100,000 of everything except science.  You can reach 0, and it does not regenerate unless you get structures that do it.  That is the only fix I would make",
        "This is the mobile game that other games wish they could be.  After playing for 5 minutes I said shut up and take my money (to unlock additional features, not pay to win).  Gameplay is simple enough to get going, but deep enough to keep playing.  Interface is well suited to my cellphone.  Art/Graphics are very nice.  If I had to nit-pick, the resource icons could be less similar in some instances, but this is ONLY complaint I could come up with.  If you like resource management, civilization building game play, this is a must play.",
        "There's a very annoying bug - animals often freezes and don't produce resources so I have to put them on certain tiles once again. The game is also laggy when an empire is big enough. The concept is great but there's some work needed 👷🏻\u200d♂️",
        "Absolutely amazing game. The unpaid version is really fun, excellent as a stand alone.  The paid expansion is awesome and very much worth the money. The challenges are fun and diverse, you can spend hours perfecting them.  I also like that this company is not a money grabber. Once you pay for the expansion that is it, no micro-transactions. Great representation of what a game app should be, something I am happy to support.",
        "The game is fun at first but it gets hard i cant win any other planets. I really really wanted to play infinite mode but sadly it needs money to unlock and im poor so i cant pay to get it :( also it sometimes the game freezes when i upgrade something and it the screen hangs. Please please please make infinite mode available free!!!!!!!",
        "I like the game but I don't like that you have to buy the unlimited mode and i don't like that the time is limited. I thought I found a game I would love but then it said the \"end game is here.\""

Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",
        "Lack of game play is what gets me. Don't get me wrong, it's a smart tactic. Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",
        "I was so excited for the new update because it contained a cloud save feature... But guess what... The cloud save doesn't work at all.. The developers just want to draw attention so we could act silly and buy the game for decent 8 to 10 hours of gameplay then if we want to change our device,to be totally left out without choices but not to install the game and cry for the lost money... ADD A DAMN CLOUD SAVE!!",
        "It was a good game. Too bad it doesnt open now after the update. It says something below the logo screen and then dissapears too fast you cant read it. And when it goes to the gear connecting thing to try to connect it crashes.",
        "Can you guys pls fix the game because when I started to play then while its loading THE GAME GOT CRASH! The oldest version work for me but this version it didn't work. Thx to read this."

        "need team voice chat and its super perfect.... anyone wants to try new battle royale? then try this... I think it might've been better than Rules Of Survival... this game is worth it..... it also lets you to shoot while your friends is driving a vehicle..well, only for duo or squad mode obviously....but what's more, you can actually pilot a helicopter..... nice...",
        "Great graphics with minimum config,controls are awesome  and it has dive button,can jump thru walls and climb windows,way better than the other survival games on phone,it has bullet physics! the only thing im concerned about is The lagging when shoorting from far distances,and id like to suggest a configuration for the graphics to adjust compatibilty . Thank you for this game 5stars! Your doing just great devs!",
        "I love this game and the devs reply to my requests in their official facebook page, thats awesome. One thing I wanna have here is voice chat. Definitely the best even low end devices can play this lag free. I recommend this. I don't know why they rate this so low but it's probably cuz it's not tha popular yet. Keep it up!",
        "I don't know why it got low ratings ....    I want to tell u thie guys..  ur game was absolutely great.... 125 players that impressive....graphics is good.. some minor buys ... plz reduce the sound of the heli...the most important thing is the render distance is soooooooooooo good.... i don't know how it's achived with in 180 MB .... I'm telling u this I really liked ROS....but not any more.....bc In here their is no such a lag and it can in any device... skill based  .. very good rendering distance.. the bullet drop is so realistic...jumping mechanism sooooo great and all this good things come with in 180 MB .. I love u guys.... GREAT WORK. keep it up....I really look up to the next update.......😘😘😙😙👌👌👌👌👍",
        "Hard to attack, easy to die. I already point the crosshair to the enemy, and when I start shooting, the crosshair miss the enemy and start to move around randomly, looks like I attack the ground, and end up died. Also, hard to find weapon and ammo. Your game is good, but not good enough. You are trying to fully copy PUBG, which is played on PC, while your game is Android-Based, hard to control. Hard to control. Easy to aim, but never hit, because the crosshair like to move around and land the bullet on the ground. Try to play Free Fire Battleground by Garena. Overall, Free Fire much better than yours. Uninstalled!",
        "Hey, umm please reply! I'd really love to play this game. I really think this is better than Ros and freefire but I cant play it. Everytime I log in and it starts to load it will say \"Poor internet connection, please reconnect.\" why is it like that? I got 4 bars of the wifi. My wifi is fast. please fix it or tell me what to do cuz I really really really wanted to play this game so bad."

The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "While this game is simple, it is kind of mindlessly fun. The problem with it, and thus the two star rating(something I changed from a Four to Two), is that this game suffers from far too many ads. While understandable for something like a reward, this game subjects you to ads just about every time you change a screen. It goes from a little irritating, to absolutely frustrating. Unless you wish to pay two dollars for something that probably wouldn't be worth it for 99 cents, I'd recommend avoiding it.",

It's so rare to find a game that doesn't pressure you into spending money in order to progress, but I've never felt that way with KleptoCats. I appreciate the little mysteries and puzzles/codes. I honestly wouldn't change anything about this game. I love the art, the references, and the creativity put into this game. I've even watched the ads because I want to give HyperBeard some revenue since I can't spend money.",
        "Congratulations on the massive success that Klep2cats will be and all of the great things that have come and will continue to come your way. Please always always keep moving this fun little addicting kitty game forward. One little detail however, the notifications work perfectly on the sequel and it'd be nice if they could be resolved for this one as well.",
        "Love it. I love how it's just like my cat. Lol. Just leave it and it'll come back in a minute. Some may say this game is boring because you have to wait for the cat to comeback, but you don't have to stupidly check your phone 24 hours, waiting for the cat to comeback(lol i did that the first time tho😂😂) i can still do things, i don't have to play it all the time...and I like that. Good job!!",

The only offer completed I got compensated for was liking on Facebook. Not my 200 gems. Not one of the 100 gem offered work . Very disappointed I've deleted the game and restarted a few times jus to try to get the offers to work but nothing. Download if you want it's not a bad game. Quiet fun . But when it comes to customer support ur better off talking to a wall.",
        "I was just starting the game when I decided to buy an offer of 15000 gems for 10 dollars and I did. Sadly I didnt get any gems so I got out of the app, went back in and nothing. Please help me with this problem I want those gems. I want either a refund or my gems I don't care which one it is",
        "Don't spend money on this.  Graphics are even worse than expected for a game based on the most basic, low-detail character thematic.  Unresponsive controls, even when using a device released in the past year.  The paid add-on is waste of money. Removing ads does not redeem this uninspired game.  Overall a disappointment. Don't waste your time or dollars.",
        "The reason the app is or was free is because it is a rip off. When ever it becomes cash dont buy it it's not like it says. Try overdrive it's the same concept but better graphics, controls and story line",
        "Can someone please tell me why all the characters are rip off league of legends champions?? Or has nobody noticed because it's so obvious if u play league.",
        "Ahh. your controller is closer to left and right maybe you just add in setting of controller let your player to adjust them and upgrading hero is so much expensive, also buying a new hero. Why so much expensive ? So if you reading this please fix it. And fix the health bar and add some effech when approach the boss and some story if you can. Lol ! Okay thats all ! Thanks.

There's this one part were there's a crazy drop that you have to go up.and I know this is where I'm will see to go since there is a checkpoint next to it. All there is is a steep mountain with nothing to grab onto . Also the hammer doesn't sense its surfaces to well. Which makes the game a lot harder. But otherwise great game. It just needs some bug fixes. Thank you.",

You think this is just an ordinary truck? Surely not. With its jet engine, it can deliver orders to any spot on the globe, any town or village, virtually instantly. What about this old shed? Take a closer look. This is a high-tech superhero data center! Even that toad behind the wheat patch has his secrets.

There should be and online multiplayer race mode and the mountains just endless also the rocks on the mountain should have a chance to swap places and stuff like that after a few falls also a easy one add in some funny cool looking skins for the hiker and maybe a tool upgrade system and how to get these is u get rock points which u get a few every time a certain hight is reached",

        "Very good! The graphics are reminiscent of scribblenauts, which is a great look, controls are simple yet very good. But, I do have two problems: One, the pricing of the sets are too much for what they are. 6.99? More like 4.99. The currency i can understand, maybe bump up the quantity of the 50.00 dollar currency pack, otherwise, the currency pricing is fair. The other one is that there are many framerate bugs! Please attempt to fix them! Besides my problems, the game gets a score, in my book, of a 4.0, great game!",
        "It was a fantastic time eating, addictive, fun game;  The developer became greedy with too many ads.  Also, at the same time, it started using too many resources, frequently pausing for up to two seconds during gameplay, rendering it unplayable.  I really enjoyed this game. Nice, challenging physics and strategy through design and problem solving.",
        "Only reason I've won't give 5 stars is that they use to give holidays special mission this year they've skipped it. Seen a few improvements other last year an half but nothing major. But all in all fun game build crafts and hope u make it.",
        "This might be the worst godamn game I have ever played in my long and miserable life. I wish I would have put a bullet trough my sckull on the time it took me to play this dispiccable piece of communist human waist. Not only did it give actual cancer, but now I must clench my memory of this game but also purge every single person who has ever played this god forsaken game, including myself. Have a nice day.",
        "Recent update filled the game with adds. Used to play and only see adds when finishing a mission and selecting the option for extra coins or gems. Now they auto play adds between runs forcing you to have to watch two for the benefit. Good game but they got greedy.",
        "I really like the game however when i was playing i finally got the bigfoot and played for awhile. Then i left the game to play my Xbox but when i got back on i didnt have the bigfoot anymore which really got me mad. So please fix that bug"

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Great game, I totally love it. I don't mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

Lovee It!",
        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills."

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

Unless you have or possibly buy power flowers, and you can't even continue without finishing those levels. So for the effort 2 stars but for the fact that your game used 80+ mb of data and I can't continue playing unless I pay you for extras 0.",
        "Just another matching game that ends up being pay to play. Lackluster quotes from \"gurus of modern life\" are less than inspiring. This is less a relaxing game and more a moneygrubbing attempt to add to the empire of a certain exceedingly wealthy talkshow host. Not impressed in the least bit. In short, save yourself the time and space on your device, and don't download this!",

Learn the definition of free and fix it",

Update, I am still playing the game, I have to say this is the most beautiful and imaginative game I have come across, it has been really well thought out so hats off to the designers of it, I just wish there was a little more opportunity to gain diamonds. I would certainly recommend anyone downloading this game.",

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "Cannot get the app to load properly, but it is a really fun and addictive game. Great challenges, and I like seeing what designs others have come up with. I've won challenges with very little money, it is possible, if that is a concern for people. I would like to see challenges developed more quickly, and ways to earn more money. I usually have very little money to work with. Maybe have an option to get keys or money when voting. But overall I really enjoy the game."

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

        "Mars: Mars is a very fun game in which you take platforming and collectables to the next level. The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "It's like this game was made just for me.  I love everything about it.  I hope for future upgrades to keep the game fun and engaging.  The magnet tail needs to be improved a bit, so that the meat doest drag behind.  Also a change of scenery could be cool.",
        "Ads don't work (it always thinks I'm at the 20 day limit) so making any progress in the game is impossible. It's just a grind without any payoff. Really boring.",
        "My only issue right now is I can no longer watch the ads for extras. Every time I try, it just tells me they will refresh in 24 hours.",
        "Fuuuuuuuun! Silly timekiller and a solid game. Ads are not intrusive.",
        "Sometimes there obstacles that I have no choice  but to receive damage the question is what causes less damage like that's not fair. Or when the tank comes. Before it comes it shoots a missle how am I supposed to predict where the missle is going to be at if it gets fired before I can even see the tank. And several other things I would love to point out but I'm sure I can only type so many characters. I genuinely like playing this game a few fixes can make it more enjoyable instead of me getting frusterared. Another small suggestion the magnetic tail is a waste the way it is. Mainly the meat gets dragged around and gets left behind. Maby make it to where with each upgrade it increases the circumference of its pull and actually pulls them to you instead of dragging and leaving behind. Any ways of you would like to hear more ideas let me know. Also I'm just going out on a hunch whoever made this game is not the one fixing it. Game create out creating games and intern or whatever is the one doing the \"pollishing\" to the game and is making it worse. So someone who knows what they are doing needs to be doing the corrections not some dumbass you found down the road if that's the case. Everyone should see the difference in the signature and everyone has a unique signature aka trade mark."

        "The stories are really interesting and it is hard to out down the phone once you got into one of the story. 😂😂 Although I really do wish that it is more easier to get the diamond but overall I totally recommend it!!  Keep it up the good work!  😊",
        "Can anyone tell me what SNS is?",
        "I loved it so much😍😍",
        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

        "I like the game. But it drives me nuts I can only play for a little bit. Then wait 3 hours to play again. The ticket reload is annoying. They should have ways to earn more tickets, and give you at least 5 tickets. Lol ...I thought the characters talked, but they don't. So that'll be a fun if they add that in. I've been play bad boys and I like it.",
        "This is a really fun way to read and loads of great stories inside. You should get passes quicker and free when you buy diamonds like they used to do it. The ads are annoying but I know they help pay for the app too. You should be able to skip ads with purchase for a short time at least.",
        "This game is amazing. I can play and discover many interesting stories. But I have a problem its an issue long ago. It's about connecting to the network because the app in my phone can't connect well to the internet its an error. PLEASE fix it...😣😣😣",
        "Great story's to read.the ones I love to read is Isak &Finn.what can I say I love all stories and some are my favorite ones I just read over and over,like Love is a Drug.p.s I was playing pitch perfect in the deep treble it only let me go up to 18 only and know that I want to play it it takes me back to my favorite.",
        "I think that if u like drama u should get this app. I've always loved this app I always get upset when I loose the ticket thingys cuz I'm at a good part of the story lol 😂 but ya I give it a 5 stars. I LOVE IT 💕",
        "I can't see my full screen! I cannot even see one word our my character in the story! I see one little fragment of the game! This game is a horrible game! I would be nice if I could actully see the game!"
