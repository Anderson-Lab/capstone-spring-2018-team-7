        "Thank you Bluehole and Tencent for making the best mobile game I have ever played. I tried the PUBG mobile clones before this official version was released and I must say I'm extremely impressed with the entire experience. This is as close to a console or PC game as you are going to get. Superb graphics, easy to figure out and implement controls, the ultimate battle royal game for mobile. I have never loved a mobile game so much. There is a reason this is a 700mb download. This Game is 5 stars across the board. PUBG for mobile is EPIC.",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

I am enjoying this relaxing, mind game however, I had to reset my phone and all my progress was lost...not cool! I've contacted the developers / company twice with no fix offered yet.😔😕 Hoping to get an accommodation and a way to avoid this issue in the future!",
        "This is a pretty awesome app which makes our mind to formulate words with the given letters. But many a times we come across words for which we are unaware of the meaning. If you guys can create a small block on the screen which displays the meaning of the last word created/accepted. Then this app will become an ultimate learning app or say vocabulary building app as well. Hoping to see the enhancement is sometime near future.",

So never buy a new phone if you don't want to start over.",

        "The advertisement I saw for this game, WASNT EVEN THIS GAME. I downloaded it expecting a different time of word game, looked like a whole bunch of Scrabble word tiles lined up and you'd choose words. This game is nothing like that. Its ok, but very misleading advertisement and disappointed in that.",
        "It's fun and cute. I like that it gets harder as you progress. Edit: March 17th, 2018. There was an ad after you completed a level and that was fine. That's how it was last night and usually the ads were quick. Now there is an add at the very bottom of your game which really makes it difficult to concentrate and you accidentally click it every time you shuffle your letters. This was 5 stars, but now it's going to have to be 3. That, to me, is very annoying and eventually I'll stop playing altogether as a result."

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "After playing for three days, this doesn't feel like a Sims game, some actions and interactions with objects are meanless, why do I need to use the toilet? One of the key factors of the Sims is to fill their needs, what are the needs of these Sims? It doesn't care at all if I decide to not pursuing one of the stories with friends, hobbies or career. And where are their feelings? Their aspirations? If I follow two romantic stories,  those Sims don't seem to be jealous even if I'm dating them in the same room! This is a game for the money,  not to play a simulation.",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much"

        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it.

        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "Fun off the bat... But then it slows down to a brutal snails pace. It's a great concept, it just needs a lot more updates!  *Slow claps* great work on the \"updates\". I shouldn't have updates in parenthesis.. The characters are cool, leveling is also a cool touch, and a whopping 7 new bats? Killing it!..? But come on, way to go extreme overboard on the speed! All the other bad reviews cover it better. I just wanted to also sarcastically congratulate your update.",
        "pretty good game, glad they're updating it and adding in more bats. I play it when I'm waiting at the airport. the new update sped things up, made it really buggy. resets your hits at 44000 M and isn't really playable at this point, hopefully it's fixed soon",
        "Latest update totally destroyed the game. Even using the basic bat hitting it perfectly straight it takes the ball 2 seconds to fly 100,000 meters and then the game resets back to swing again. Without even getting to actually make any currency for upgrades",
        "UPDATE: Every time I hit, the game resets it's self. I hit the ball the meters get up above 80k and then the screen goes black and then I'm back at the plate.   Any upgrades coming soon? I have all the bats and am over 30,000 meters. Need some more upgrades."

The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn't much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.",
        "Let's be honest here. The concept was very creative and unique, but the game was very poorly designed. The slide is not smooth and   feels very unstable, I wasn't able to enjoy playing the game. The graphics are very low and the game itself is slow. Apart from that the idea was very well thought of but I feel you should have added more time and professionalism into the whole design, the game has potential.",
        "One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don't really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...",
        "I really like this app but the the amount of ads are crazy! Wayyy too many. On a good note, the personalisation. I really like the different range of balls and the night time vortex, where everything stands out, and is all black. The trails are really neat too! Although the ball is quite sensitive when dodging around the obstacles. It is still great! I got a score of 104 on my second go! I'd definitely recommend this app! Also i have the samsung galaxy s4 so you can definitely 8nstall this if you have the same phone as me!😊",
        "It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.",
        "It's hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I'll be doing fine but it'll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I'd love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks."

        "Over the few years of playing I have installed, uninstalled & reinstalled the game all due to frustrations of not being able to complete the higher levels ( usually around the higher 30 lower 40 's )   After spending considerable time, large amounts of the points to purchase all the options offered I am still unable to win, move up in levels due to the set difficulty of the game. I therefore uninstall, only to find myself in no time at all missing the game...the challenge & reinstalling the app.  👍👍👍  Good job to the developers.",
        "I don't like that strong competitive advantages are behind pay walls. These advantages make PVP almost unplayable because of how unfair it is for those who haven't paid real world money for them. Also, one of my fully upgraded non-starter ships was completely reset.",
        "Great game. Would have given it 5 stars but a recent update has made the commercials play at max volume. I play the game in silent mode, in bed, while wife is asleep. Sudden barrage of loud commercials has ruined the experience. It has actually resulted in me playing less and therefore has had me watch less commercials. Go figure.",
        "For some reason all the videos have stopped working. The double coins video, the video for another life and the video to allow an extra spin of the wheel, please fix and I will 100% change my rating",
        "Hard to win PvP when you can't get any power ups. Need to make it more fair. I have no trouble losing a game but when you make it to level 4 and only got 1 power up. Almost impossible to have a chance",
        "Tried multiple times for them to give me my purchase, I have shown them the evidence and they agree I don't have my in game purchase and have been trying to fix it for ten days and won't issue a refund. Horrible customer service"

I hope you make the main menu button apear immediately or allow you to click your back button to go to the menu of the game but other than that AMAZING game!",

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",

        "Game sucks donkey *****. You play maybe 10 beginner holes and get chests that open in 12 seconds. THEN you play a normal hole and get a chest that doesn't open for 4hrs. You only get four chest slots so that means you can only win four holes then you have to wait 4hrs (or 8 or 12hrs depending on the chest you choose to open) before you can get anything for winning a hole. In two days, I haven't even played 18 holes. Guess you gotta have money if you wanna play. Thought I trusted the \"Editors Choice\" games, guess not.",

        "Only been playing a week and matches are not equal. I am playing obvious payers and people that have multiple tournament wins with maxed out equipment. They are killing me. Plus I go first 9 out of 10 times, no joke. This needs to be fixed"

This is a problem that really needs to be addressed. I read the reviews before downloading, so I know it's a consistent problem.

        "Hello NetEase, thank you for this wonderful game. I have been playing RoS for a few months now. Lovely game but after the last update, my game freezes at the server screen. After several attempts if at all the server menu loads, the game kicks me out when I try to login my account. I tried repairing the game many times, reinstalled it too many times, but the same problem persists. Hope your team will look into the matter soon. Thank you!"

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

The refill of free points every 15 minutes are great and I enjoy the challenge of doubling them, tripling them and so on.  Thanks for the fantastic game but please fix the 'free coins on us' broken links.",

        "Was doing great until day 3. Then NO bonus and a big dive to no funds. If u want to play fun games for a few days, then uninstall...this is ur best choice."

        "Simple, Nice and Addictive. Almost perfect! But the game build lags from when the log records too many life events, which could be solve with a clean log record button. Another Thing is the name your child gets when your child is born in korea but you are from another country, the kid gets your name instead of your surname as his/her surname",
        "I love it! The only thing I would say is to let is have the option to transition without being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Or at least give us an option on the action board(with the profile of our person) with the option to identify as a transgender at schooling age of 6 or 5. Also, can we have the option to go to early schooling from 2 years? Some people do this. I love this game! It's very interesting and fun.",
        "After so long Google will actually let me review this now! I absolutely guarantee you will have fun with this game. There's so many choices that affect your life, you can be so many different things, and no life is like the other. If you're looking for a quick life simulator game to pass the time, or just play any time at all, this is the game for you.(P.S if you want to transition, you need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Very rare.)",
        "Overall Its time killing for me, and, just some advice, we should have a Save state, because im kinda upset like.. i have played these game for 3 hour to age of 60 and retire and having a 7/8 mansion bedroom but i accidentally clicked back and then its started over again.. I wanted to see ma kids grow lol, but then i clicked it :(",
        "I love this game and it leaves a lot to your imagination. I do have a few things I would really love to see in this game. I would love for there to be 5 bedroom houses. 4 bedroom houses just aren't big enough sometimes and mansions cost WAY to much even if you're making over 100k a year. Also if you can control your children as well as make suggestions to your spouse to get a job, work out, ect. Would be amazing.  I would love to be able to have little grand babies on the game as well as step children. Even though this last one is a small request I would love to have my children in order by age if I adopt an older child then the children I already have without them being at the bottom of the list. It already states that they are adopted in their details tab so they shouldn't have to be at the bottom.",
        "Great fun little life simulation with a lot of potential. Their need to be more career paths other than work, painting, music or ceo. I want to be an athlete, a career criminal, drug runner, politician etc. And the UI needs to be cleaned up. There's no reason why clubbing and holidays shouldn't be under leisure."

        "I love the game and then when i saw that there was 3D projects i was so excited but they did not meet my expectations the controls were a little hard and the graphics were a little shady. Also there is a lot of adds i don't mind some adds but there's just so much so it would be nice if you cut down on the adds. Over all i really like the game i love that i don't need Wi-Fi to play this.",
        "Ghoulishness hzhdhdhdh VC Bob hzhdhdhdh hzhdhdhdh VC USD per the attached resume and cover and I will send a private youweirdo if you are doing well and that was the we can do it again but this is a nice day you can get the same thing happened to me and see if you have a nice weekend and I will have a good idea for a little while to get a good time to do this is an automatically by Microsoft outlook for iOS and room and the best way to do with the room and the fact I have to be busy and I am going be able but screen software to view the full image to open in full size and weight of the time to get it done by then and I have a great day room for the late response I got the email address to send me the link below to verify that the same as the one that was the best regards.. room was not able and the fact I am.",
        "Simply love it, if i may make a suggestion... how about providing an option to hide the finished works from the first tab? That way one would not have a lot of scrolling to do find a new piece to start. :) keep up the good work! 👍",
        "This game is AWESOME!!! and Everytime the game updates their app it adds more exciting options to playing the game such as creating your own pictures from your picture gallery folders or other of your downloaded photos from your picture galleries or saved photos. It's so much fun. I also find it to be a Great stress reliever for me. ThaNkS, pixel art app. I love this game, I find time each day to play... Very Relaxing 🤗🤗😀😀😉😉.",
        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too.",
        "Great way to relax or calm down. Lots of choices without having to earn game coin to buy more that only disappoint. Mix of both easy and challenging. One thing would improve over all play and that would be an easy way to locate any missed cells at the end of a puzzle. Having to scroll through some of those detailed ones to find one or two blanks can be a real headache! Other than than i think this is the best color game I have tried! Keep up the great work!!"

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun!

        "Finally got the game to load, was delighted to see that the multi hour rewards were 880,000, so much more than other slot games! All of a sudden however you guys have decided to restrict those hourly gifts to 200,000! How are we supposed to play these games when most of these slots by default are asking us to bet several hundred thousand credits at a time? And yes, I do buy coin packs on rare occasions, but I shouldn't have to just to play this game! 😒",
        "It is a great apps and the games are amazing. I've reached level 241 and won big amount of credits.. however I just found out i could not go back to the pain page and keeps saying that is on downlaoding assets. Can anyone tell me what can i do to...?",
        "Loved this game but seems like product madness is very money hungry. You guys have to remember your just a game not a real casino. Lighten up on your wins and bonuses and maybe ill give you a try again.",
        "I think its fantasic i would like to see more coin bonuses as i dont always have the money to buy. Highly recommend it! 👌 be refreshing to see replies to good rateings not just the bad ones. Seriously who cares about the bad. 😂",
        "Do not download! You should not have to wait up to 250 spins for a feature (yes I counted). Get stuffed product madness, worse than the real thing. Give me my money back",
        "Fafafa gold slots are very easy slots for Jackpots. They hourly to 3 hours  bonus. They also once a day a daily spin. Levels up really fast. Now I have tried to purposely get rid of this game. However Every time I tried I would win more.  I really put it to the test. Thank you."

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",

It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved",
        "I installed the game. I was enjoying it then suddenly it stoped working giving me an error message of \"license stoped working\". I uninstalled it and will try to install it. I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",
        "I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.",
        "Characters repeat the same thing over and over and it gets really irritating. And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

If anybody else has this problem, please contact the dev team they will gladly help you. Happy mining. Cheers",

Not to your Facebook account, or Google play game and has problems with it's server. Why any one would spend money on this game until they could at least save stuff is beyond me.",
        "MY STORY OF HUNGRY SHARK  I've been playing hungry Shri since years and I reached my tiger shark.... suddenly it got updated and I lost all my progress and returned to the first level of reef shark...I was so disappointed and uninstalled the game after a few months I reinstalled it and while playing I saw the cloud save and clicked it.....I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD RETURN TO MY PROGRESS....I enjoy playing it and I love the new background and updates  Best wishes- A hungry shark fan",
        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "Love the game but in the last couple days, I'll get into a warp and it'll freeze completely on me. And It truly disappoints me because I could've had so many coins by now. I cannot play the game at all with it not freezing and making me start over.. I don't know if it's a virus or what but I wish it would get fixed."

        "I love this game! Not only is it a great way to spend some spare time, but you can play it offline too! I downloaded this game because my little cousin (9 years old) was playing it and he wanted some help. Its a great and fun filled way to help teach kids how to spell new words and get their brains going! Not only for kids though because there are some pretty big words to figure out, but it's fun for all ages.",
        "I love this game!! Keeps my brain awake. I love that u can turn the music off. Very addictive game! The ONLY thing i dont like is they are very cheap with the points. I play another game thats almost exactly the same but at level 136 I already hav 8600points. Its gonna take forever to get that many points here!! Oh and i dont use FB so i hav no way of getting hints WITHOUT using points!",
        "It may have a few ads but it's just fine with me,this game is very addictive, even my 7 year old plays this game. My only problem is I had to start all over again after getting a new phone. But other than that bummer, I love the game n so do my children. Keeps your mind working",
        "Good game, but why won't it take \"tire\" as a word? This is a legitimate word, and yet it never accepts it. Also, when you get a new phone, make sure to back up your game data and use the backup to restore all apps and data on the new device.

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

I liked the opportunity of exiting out the app while my Tamagotchi is sleeping so that I don't have to wait awhile for his energy to refill. I've exited out of the app three times after putting him to sleep and three times, I had to return to put him to bed again. PLEASE fix this because I liked it before the new update.",
        "I paid for the starter pack which says it will remove the mandatory ads but guess what, ads are still there. Please do something about it and I will change my ratings.  Edit after reply* wow not even an apology for someone who paid. Kind sir, then please at least let your consumers know that there are actually 2 kind of ads instead of just simply stating 1? No Tom dick or harry will know that unless you state it. Good day.",
        "The only issue i had is the back button when tamagochi sleep. It make auto-wake state when i push the back button. It would be nice if even i push the back button tamagochi still sleeping instead wake up and also option for how long they sleep like 4,6,8 hours. I'll change the rating after the back button issue has fix. Btw the game is good, you should add adventure or something like that.",
        "Good nostalgia, awesome graphics but needs better execution. Allow optional interactivity with friends, for example. The main point of using a smartphone is connectivity. Make earning anything easier, this will increase the replay value. Your game will become popular by word of mouth, I tell you. Don't make it a quick cash grab. Think about how you can keep the game afloat instead of having to scrap it and start anew if it fails.",
        "I did a YouTube video over this app. Overall Tamagotchi Forever is fun. But ads and lack of things to do made this app a miss opportunity for the creators. I do like optional ads. But the ads at the top and in between screens are lame. Also for an app like this cosmetics are the perfect thing to add, but they limit the costumes to about 3 each character. Another nice thing that would've been cool to see would've been decorating your house & visiting friends. These other things would've made the app great.",
        "I can't see ur advise is helping me, none of them. Back button will appear after i press phone's back button. And it makes my pet wakes from his sleep.  And yes, we can collect all of the character but we can't interract with other player, we ONLY can collect and evolve them, not like in tamagotchi v7 if u know what i mean.  Unistalling this game"

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

Comfortable gameplay, not a time hog. Cons: 40gems for an additional host slot in diagnostics was for the que, not simultaneous diagnostic host tests. Game could only be played online. Completing 2 Escalante training sessions don't always get rewarded in daily tasks.",
        "I like the game it's quite engaging but  at some point in the game it becomes limiting because of the 30/30 host cap and it's difficult to get more hosts to combine with the existing ones because there's not enough space. I can't just delete or combine the existing ones just to free up because I need them too.",
        "The Delos installation is taking all daaaaay! Stuck in it! Tech support is USELESS!",
        "The 30 host cap immediately becomes pretty difficult to work around, especially when you need to have duplicates of the  hosts to increase their max level cap/attribute score as well as duplicates of hosts for hat colours. I'm hoping there's a way to increase this later in the game. Also, synthblood is incredibly difficult to obtain especially when you need more to fix higher level hosts. Overall though, the game is pretty generous with currency, so I don't think I've ever ran into a hard building wall that made me think I had to spend money on it to progress further. So far, I'm enjoying the game and looking forward to the updates",
        "The host cap of just 30 is a real problem because it becomes difficult to rank up higher level hosts. I would love to continue playing but the cap is a dealbreaker. Hope you can fix this asap",

I spent SO MUCH TIME and effort in achieving everything, and yet all of a sudden you'd lock me out of my account like this. I am gravely disappointed, and I hope you could fix this issue."

        "Good fun.",
        "This is a great way to exercise your brain. For me, as I get older, it's important to keep my brain active & this game does that effectively. And it's fun too! I bumped into my niece the second day I was playing, which is super cool. I don't see often because she lives in TX & we're in MS. She kicked my butt by the way.",
        "I have resigned games frozen for over 40 days only for some to pop up on my turn but of course I can not play them. Numerous games I play disappear but pop back up when I uninstall and reinstall. But I still can't play them. It is not just with my Samsung 8 note myy husband has the same problem with his LG. Fun to play but getting to be to much to go in and try to resign games",
        "Its a really nice overhaul of the old version. The only issue i have is the push notifications for it. There are times I have to open it to see if it's my move or not. Other times it works good and sends the notification. It's just a little glitchy in that aspect. I am currently using a Galaxy Note 8 and it does the same on my iPhone 8 Plus as well. So it's definitely something within the game. Once thats fixed I will gladly update this review and give 5 stars. Otherwise great game, very fun and addictive.",
        "The game is challenging and excellent brainwork especially if one is competitive enough to want to accomplish their weekly challenges. I also enjoy the solo challenges. In addition the new decorated eggs challenge adds a whole other level of advanced thinking. I like to use the word radar most, but also the hindsights, see where you can play, and free swaps."

The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!!

        "Guys this game is the best offline game I have ever played as it is toooooo much addictive. U would not believe me, firstly u would die very easily but as u play on then it would be easy to create high score. It also makes your reflexes more faster. The creators have done a great work. And people who are saying there are lots of adds are talking rubbish.  Play it!!!!!",
        "Want to play an ad? Download this game and you'll get to experience all the thrills of pop up ads between brief stints of playing the game you thought you downloaded instead of the ads. There is at least two ads per game. Some of the ads go landscape to further increase game play pleasure, X one out and Bam! Bonus round go straight to the app store to see the ad you X'ed out available for download. Go back and BAM try the X again YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACE. Good times were had played ten games and uninstalled. ADWARE ten millions downloaded how many kept it longer than twenty minutes.",
        "It's so fun with all the different types of patterns.im telling you its the best game you will play in your life.When I die it's actually quite good, because the last time I did had 100 to spend and when I had passed the next 4 rounds I had 10,000 to spend so you should realy get this game,and Change your life people.Plus the new thing is the star block makes you invincible for a short amount of time for example I was going when I had 93 and I went in 24 star and I Could go through 100 and 123,000 for 1 minute. Anyway great game if you liked my review go onto Episode to see that review. Hope you love the game. Oh and I forgot to tell you a list of all the patterns we have purple, green,rainbow,pink,🍔,💵,🚗 and grey.",
        "It's a very fun game with so much to offer, the snake colors are very funny and colorful, but one thing I do not like is that there are SO many ads! When you simply try to restart a game it makes ANOTHER ad pop up for the 35 time. Please fix this issue.",
        "Nice concept, nice controls, the problem is that is too much randomnes and less skill. It forces me in corners where I'm definitely dead or the good boxes are in corners where i can't go because of the walls and that also means im dead. Please make it less random or ar least make that if i comith to a path and because of the game i cant chage is, at least dont make the first mistake ista death.",
        "It's to many ads like beyond the amount I've seen on any other app. You lose a life then there a 30 sec ad after every time you lose a life. When the ads over you jump right back into the game. Making it difficult to play because it doesn't give you enough time to make your next move. If they remove the ads may it would be a better game."

        "Suggestion:  Have your developer(s) move the \"In Game\" volume icon to the bottom left corner.  If youre appealing to the masses. Remember that roughly 90% of the world is right handed.  While holding a phone with two hands; sideways. I cannot be the only one that accidentally keeps hitting the volume button with their \"Thenar Eminence.\"  The part of your palm below your thumb.  That and I paid for your game. Stop making me watch adds for an extra life. Haha 🤙",
        "This will probably sound cliche but- Too many ads! I wouldnt be complaining if the 'No ads' payment had worked. Yes, it went through, And sure enough the money was taken off of my card, But the ads stayed. Otherwise, I like the game lots.",
        "Purchased the game with no ads for 2.99 since the ads seemed to make the game run slower. I recently switched devices and the iap button doesn't do anything. I have to watch the ads, deal with the lag and loss my 100% acct. contacted the devs 2 different ways and haven't heard anything back. Google wouldn't refund me either. I played this game multiple times a day. It's one of my favorites but since they won't honor my purchase I won't honor a 5 star review. Shame on the devs",
        "Personally I love this game but be prepared to fail A LOT but once you had the game for a while you kinda get better!It's so much fun and addictive!! The only thing I don't like is all the ADDS there is soo many but still love the game 👍",
        "Honestly, i had to change my rating cause this app caused a heck of lag on my phone while it was sleep. Like simply i turned off the screen while playing the game and then tried to turn it back on, the phone was just simply non-responsive, took a while to turn the screen on and eventually caused the lock screen launcher to restart. Like really the app shouldn't be doing anything when my phone is sleep. Nexus 6P is my device just so u know.",
        "The game is fun and a great time killer, but it just lags too much, and there is too many ads. One second im on top of the leader board and the next, a person spawns on top of me! If these bugs were fixed, I'd gladfully give this game 5 stars, but for now, HORIBBLE!!!!"

They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",

Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",

        "Great game and I love it! However when game is buffing or out of range they take the coins or if in bonus it kicks you out and money is lost and never returned nor does it place you back where you left off. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY! thank you. I still rate it 5 star cause I know you guys are going to handle it.",
        "at first was a blast but as any new slot game it tightens up and harder to level up. graphics are great but i will not buy coins on a daily basis in order to keep playing. so sad that this game turned out to be like the rest of them.",
        "Gameplay is interesting and sort of a hybrid of a Big-Fish-style game and those other too-many-blinky-lights and too-many-mission games. What irks me, though, is that you can't revert back to lower limits when your chips shrink. They may think that will make me buy chips, but they think wrong. One other thing: A game associated with NatGeo should be able to hire proofreaders and copy editors so that grammatical errors don't show up in the game.",
        "I have just started, but I wish that I could understand what or how to play the game better. This is my first slot machine game. And I really don't know how to play yet. Could you put some of the rules on at the first of the game, for us dummies?",

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

I also recorded myself playing because I would live to show this game up to the world and give a review. Really enjoy it and think it deserves to be spread out",
        "wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven't! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there's the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it's long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁",
        "This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous\"Candy Crush\" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can't seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can't stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.",
        "I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it's so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You're clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I'm only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.",
        "Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.",
        "It's a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I'm going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??"

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

All other puzzle improve your skills but this isn't since you have no time to caulate the expression it's more a test of memory then calculation because you can only 3 star it if you know the expression by heart if you try workout you answer right but run out of time. You should make is so each correct answer adds time so you can accurately l improve. Also most games are broken with not enough time to do the given task and workout same as previous has no buttons so you can't play it.",

Star ratings give the game good replay value, and the workout mode is a nice addition for something short and sweet.

If all the images come at once it's impossible to pick the one appearing last. Have to remove the app though I was enjoying it so far",

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more.",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "Fantastic graphics, great controls, overall great game.  Recommended to my friends child.  Some tasks  (i.e., leveling up a character, waiting to clearing a curse, waiting to open a chest...) take too long and their is nothing to do while you wait.  Game has improved tremendously! Love the game, won't stop playing. Thank you Disney!",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?"

Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",
        "Great time killer! On those nights I can't sleep, which is too often, this is the best app to turn my would be long night into an extremely short night. The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "This app is great for passing time, I also love how you can play offline. Its very addicting as well. The only downside is that there are way to many advertisements, I can't even play one song without there being an ad",
        "I mean the game is great! But all of these add-on power up stuff always being added ends up ruining the classic game for me. I love the good original design, no power-ups or anything too extra. I don't use them and find them annoying. It's a great time killer, and a real challenege.  But, as said before, the game is going too extra and I don't really like it.  Playing it is fun, the add-ons are not."

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

Because when I click the restart button then click the screen I would always end up behind the starting point even though I didn't move yet I die immediately why is that? pls fix it, everyone who played this game of yours would appreciate that.☺️😉 (btw I kept on dying on the first part of the game because of that so....I deleted the game!😀).",
        "Just extremely broken, can't even play the game without the ball not touching the first platform and falling off the map or the game's score just going up while nothing is happening. The game is too hectic and the gravity is too much compared to the last update. It's a really good idea but I hope this isn't just a quick grab for cash.",
        "Having to restart the app every time you want to play instead of being able to hit RESTART sucks.  The app won't let you restart a game without a glitched ball each time.  Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",
        "The game is extremely broken. I can't start a game without falling off the map, and there are times when I don't even play it's a blank screen and my points meter goes up. It's a very broken game I'm thoroughly disappointed.",
        "it is extremely broken. after the first death, it starts you out right in front of the start platform and you cant play it again unless you completely close the app. its a shame that they dont even test the game before they launch it and that google play cant prevent it from launching in the first place. great game, but extremely broken.",
        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

        "Great game. Very addictive. Can use more work. I am a clan leader and I should be able to send my clan members items such as teleports, speedup etc if they do not have it and I do.  Also 9 roses a day is not enough roses should at least rollover if only 9 are going to be given. There is also a lot of account trading and account merging going on. Clans are bullying other members into taking over their account and forcing members out of their clan leader positions. This is a very expensive game and these are very unacceptable things that members should not have to deal with",
        "Not one time in a year have i gotten gold on lucky wheel. Unless i used all my chips at the end of Skelton prize. They make u use acceleration to hit targets.  Now it seems it takes more to hit. They give cheap gifts so u have to buy. I refuse. So no money no play like mz. Don't bother unless u r rich. I see they keep negative reviews away",
        "I had an issue with payments and refunds. Your representatives claimed your offical website had a refund policy, which it does not. I have requested a working link or a copy of your refund policy on the 15th of March 2018 at the time of purchase. Google have advised me to first make a review to speak with you direct before taking further action.  I have contacted your company via email, fb line and attempted whatsapp. You have responded a little to fill surcharge on account and then performed malicious and negligent to any other request I've made. Google have also tested your refund policy and witnessed it's not there or working. I look foward to a response that meet my requests.  As reported before edited I have contacted your fb, your whatsapp, your email and line contact and have been ignored. I have copies of all conversations.  I love how you deny any request for your refund policy and sanction bans. This is unlawful activity and any customer who has been threatened of a ban or banned should report this app.",

After you collect everything, there's nothing else you can do, I believe there are many ideas that Voodoo can implement.",
        "I love this game. It really helps if you have anxiety problems like i do. Plus its too adictive not to play. If you could add more powers then that would be great. Plus i love the way you can upgrade your tank and choose what perk you want. My favourite is power as it helps alot during sticky situations like when you have three layers of 13K health blocks!!! Altogether a fun addictive game that kills time!!!",

You cannot have more than 2.15 billion points to spend at a time but you can earn as many points as you would like, but you still don't have more than 2.15 billion points to spend. This game is still very addictive, I am level 1,000 for shooter speed and level 600 for shooting power.",
        "It's a great game but there is too many ads. Every time a games ends, it pops to and ad. The game is s good play and you can just sit in the middle, do nothing and not move to collecting points to up grade. That's because the course repeats, not very challenging.",

        "The gameplay is pretty good. Although it doesn't feel like you're .aking any progress because the game will just keep getting harder. The reason why i rated it 1 star, is because of the ads. There is an ad every single tome after you die. I just couldnt take the ads"

        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!",
        "There are so many good things to list about this game. First, the graphics are extordinarily beautiful. And how much this game can relax you is AMAZING! When I play this, I swear my stress is gone. This game is never stressful. I find it amazing how satisfying this game is. I also love how realistic this game it is. The veiw and echoing is what really make up this game. Every sound is perfect for the setting. You need to download this NOW!",
        "Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.",
        "Great game, but premium is almost a requirement. The game itself is great, with an uber-cool, never-seen-before concept of smashing glass with metal balls in mysterious dimensions. The only problem is that getting premium is almost a requirement if you want to do well in the game. You can't continue the level once you die without paying. I would rate this game five stars if it weren't for this.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!"

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine..",
        "This game is all pay to play. You can't compete without dumping a bunch of money into it. So like an idiot I put some money into the game and sure enough. It matched me with guys 10 times stronger then me. There's no winning unless you plan to put a lot of money into it. Which I will not be doing. Uninstalling"

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "It is a fantastic game the game speed should be turned down and the controls need a little work but otherwise I love the game. I also like how u keep coming up with new ways to get animals like jurrasic, mythic and no incet world. I hope you can make an under water world where u can schbadive to get new exotic fish. Hope u do this.",
        "Awesome how there's so many aspects and how if u get bored of one thing then yu can just move on to another and when u accomplish something you feel like throwing a party",
        "Awesome really addictive and love how the abilities of the animals really represent them in game. Love it!",
        "Good game. Great for wasting  a few minutes at a time. A little heavy on the ads",

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season",
        "Kinda hate the drift feature, like the car just auto drifts in the direction u turn. This gets annoying too since u can't turn normally when needed and the car just starts drifting, making u hit more obstacles. Graphics are good, my phone can handle the very high settings so I haven't played on the lower settings.",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is actually good. The biggest downside is that there's A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT to watch during playing. I know this is a free game, but c'mon! Waiting and watching minutes of the advertisement is longer than playing the game itself. Not to mention the conversation between characters in the game also took too long to wait and there's some things need to use real money before it can be explored.  This kind of game supposed to be fun and gives the cha cha feeling, but instead I get frustrated of waiting for the advertisement to finish before I can continue playing.  Out of all that, this game is great."

        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "Supposed random game is not random. You only win the lowest prices until you start spending gold.  Black market is the same. Also it will take you a decade before you get the best robots unless you shell out your hard earned money. I hope the drop off scheme would earn me points, however it's just for one type of robot.",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard"

        "I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.",
        "Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating 'the option' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.",
        "I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the 'hints' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven't discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it's not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.",
        "Pretty good word search game. It's sometimes hard to hit the right letters, especially toward the bottom of the screen. Occasionally words share more than one letter in common. Sometimes  (especially in the  lower levels) a word will show up more than  once in a puzzle. Maybe extra credit for finding a word that's not on the list?",
        "It's a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don't find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.",
        "I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It's educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it's just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁"

Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

Then I noticed that they changed the looks and now it looks horrible and stupid I was disappointed by this plus to many damn ads! PS unupdate the app the older version was better the new one sucks!!",

        "The game itself is pretty good. But the thing is, there is a point to where it is to much ads. I bet that u make money every time some1 sees an ad on in your game, but u won't make any money if that person stops playing the game because of how much ads. I have been playing this game for 10 minutes and already come across around 100 ads. I might take away some of that cash income because the amount of ads Is insane. Would u rather make No Money, or A decent bit of money?",
        "The game could be better if you tone down the ads a bit more... Maybe 10 games one ad? Or maybe more? Its really annoying when you get ads every end of the round.",
        "To many adds ❎❎❎❎❎❎ corny characters. and finnaly very stupid. This game should be fun because of the adds but it has to much adds for me to have.😲😒👹👺💀☠👊"

        "Great game with fun objectives that keep it challenging until level 15.  Only issue with it is that ive recently lost all.my gems due to some sort of bug and now i dont really want to continue playing just to get back to 500 gems to experience something other than sky summit.",
        "I like it and it is a good game, except now I have no sound and the videos do not leave the screen so I can spin the wheel. The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",
        "I have enjoyed this game for a couple of years wirh no problems. The only thing I can complain about is earning so many coins and jems and not having anything to buy with them such as new characters and powerups. It's a good hand eye game.",
        "Ok I'm mad I got a new phone. There is no way to save progress. I lost 1,000 gems and 2 million coins. This is BS. They should make it so u can connected thru Facebook like most of the other games. Get it together temple run 2",
        "I abosulutly love this game. It won't get a 5 star though because I have had 4 different coin skins get taken away from me and those were actually my favorites. Idk if it was a glitch or I didn't do something but plz tell me what it is",
        "The blazing sand map is really boring. Only 3 different location there. But looks same all the entire run. Make some free space. It is very boring to run in sand all the time. Make variation like Frozen Shadows atleast. Add some location. Make some variations."

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together. To think I've actually spent real money on this game and can't get a timely answer.",

        "This game is great! Though there are things I would change about the new race mode and some things in arcade mode. For example, instead of having to pay a dollar USD to cut the rope tire, why not pay a thousand coins to get rid of it for the next 5 or 10 times it needs to show up, and have us pay the dollar to get rid of it for good. And in arcade, if you accidentally missed your reward,why not have it double the next reward rather then keep the amount the same all the time, otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing besides those two things, I love it ^^",
        "The climbing game is the only thing I hate, it's such BS. My knife will slide and hit a branch after it went into the wood. That's not supposed to happen. But overall great game.",
        "Not perfect but it's really good, hate the tires though, not willing to pay any amount of money to remove them. It would be better if after 1-5 thousand score on race, the tire would be removed or maybe throw a knife 10 times through the tire and it would be gone. Kinda silly to pay to  remove something that would make for much better gameplay if the player could play the game and earn it gone. (Mostly doing this for the 500 coins but this is an honest review)",
        "Great visuals, smooth physics, and addicting Gameplay. Great game, my only thing I'd change would be the end-game knives, past 10k all the knives kinda suck, and have awful 'flipability', making it pointless to save up for anything above 10-15k. If you added a better variety of knives into the game this would be a 5 star.",
        "Please devs, read that. You are losing the point here. The game should be good and exciting so we can support you, and not irritating and frustrating. The knives always hit with the sharp part and it is not always that it hang on the wood. It seems it is a matter of luck/random result of some algorithm. Now if that matter of luck wasn't enough, we need to dodge an annoying tire, or just pay to have it removed. Instead of pay because we like the game we should pay to play? Put a price in the game and all knives available to buy with the game money and I buy it. Let it as it is now and you won't ever see any cent from me, not even from ads because I only play it offline. I refuse to watch any ad even if I could increase a reward in 10x.",
        "IM SICK OF YOUR SHIITY UPDATES JUST TO GET SOME CASH OUT OF YOUR USERS! this Game ran smooth on my Phone but after all those updates it just stops responding. and u should ask before logging in Google Games👎👎👎"

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "I don't know why the controls have a 3.7 rating, they're actually pretty good. The gameplay's decent and the graphics are too. Btw I get over 600 score everytime just to let you know because the controls quote on quote \"barely move the car\"",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",

        "It's stupid. It's really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn't turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked."

        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",

The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Great game so far! Love the old school feel to the game! Resembles Diablo a lot! But I love the Diablo series so being able to play a game like that from the palm of my hand...GOLD! Tons of customization from characters, skills and equipment upgrades. Most of the better items are obtained just by playing! No need to buy items, save those gems for more skills to adding more companions to fight along side you! Running low on gems...just keep playing! Love a game that rewards you just for playing! Keep up the good work guys! I don't post reviews unless it's worth it so......see you out there!",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell",
        "Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I'm playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!"

    "description" : "Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.Eternium is crafted with passion by a small band of old-school RPG fans, who love making the game they always wanted to play.",

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",
        "Well the reason I put a zero on the graphics was bc I didn't get to see them.😢 I just wanted to let you know that I want to request a update on the game maybe just like let people see the video chats and not the pictures. It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry.",

        "Its awesome but why is their no idle cash when you aren't playing? I thought thats what 100 coins per min was",
        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

        "I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that's some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.",
        "I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I'll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!",
        "Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it's the other way around, dumbass.",

        "Incredible as always. Level design is amazing and the graphics are spot on. However, controls are wanky on mobile and makes a few techniques way harder than they should be. There also should have been more levels.",
        "AMAZING!!! Good game RobTop games make more be games there's only not 12 3 but wait a sec 4!! Meltdown is now released play more levels to do with seven seas vicking and monsters"

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

        "Major buggs i was at level 16 keep and level 22 had a mishap with binding my account and now i cant get in touch with anyone about the $230 ive spent on this game this month on pack i cant even use now!!!! Aa well as all the glitches that you have to put up with... I try to do research and the times counts down but it wont show as completed although it takes your rss away which is why i bought so many packs i wasted that money just last week!!! Haven't even had time to use the things i bought and now its all gone!!!! I loved the game but i will not continue to play or spend a dime on it until this issue is resolved if i get my money back i will think about not sueing them and play the game again which i dont mind spending money on because it is fun just needs improvement and Google play needs way better customer service!!!!",

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

THANKS FOR THE AWESOME GAME 👍👍👍👍👍",

Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "I just bought a golden crate for 100 golds, only to get a muscle ECU uncommon part. Disappointing,  no blue prints. Even in a free crate you get blue prints.  Frustrating the reward system is horrible. Am never going to buy any golden crate. Players should be given choices to buy golden crate but you get trusted upon with useless worthless part. Otherwise good game",
        "Great game, accidentally spent 100 gold buying a crate I didn't mean to because they swapped them around in the recent update. Wish they didn't do that, but i guess I should've been paying attention. All in all love this game as far as an arcade racing goes."

        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon. It's a good game but you've been warned..."

Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance"

I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!! I downloaded two games and completed these ridiculous tasks to earn extra \"cash\" in the game.   They both show completed and say that they've given me the reward.... but they haven't.   I disputed it.   Waiting two weeks on one of them and one week for the other.  This is racketeering.  I've been hoodwinked.. bamboozled!  I'll change my my review after they give me my CASH$$",
        "I really liked this game.  But after a while when I was playing there was message saying \"waiting for opponent's connection \" so I was waiting for a long time and then nothing happened.  But I lost ALL OF MY COINS!!!!!!  can you please fix this??  Whoever made this game.",
        "The friends system is all jacked up...   I share a Facebook, we can't use Google ID to each have our own.. And even existing friends do not show up. Fun game if you don't mind playing alone in a big lonely world of emoji.",

        "I'm having issues with the speed/timed sessions.  Towards the end, the animation sequence will glitch, resulting in my opponent having time to get off an additional shot, while I'm attempting to reset and draw the bow.  Outside of that, it's an excellent game."

        "The reason I gave it a low rating is because this, I've had two friends she my code for an extra life and it didn't work either time. To make it worse, I've emailed them twice now about the problem and they won't get back to me on the issue. Other than that though it's not a bad game. The host talks a lot but what trivia game host doesn't?",
        "Stupid Wont let me use extra lives. Force closes randomly while in the middle of it and sometime when it starts make u miss your chance then tried to use extra life. This app sucks needs to fix force close parts. Screws me out of chances",
        "This game is so much fun to play independently and with a group. The only problem it will sometimes lag but I'm sure that's being fixed. My only two suggestions are that you can add a place where u can watch back old games because the host is so funny it would be a shame to miss out. Another would be to create a version where it is a group mode that you can play between a group of friends for fun. (Separate from the live game) Overall this game is amazing and it's amazing that there is a game everyday😊",
        "The questions are very hard!! It's fun even if you don't win! But it would be nice! Sometimes the game lags and boots me out of the game. Once I got the answer correct but the app still eliminated me! I wish they would rotate the music. Wow the pots are growing!!! Why not instead of getting extra friends for extra lives, have 3 or 4 chances to get the correct answer?",
        "The game is constantly lagging, freezing and glitching. Also do not like that I cannot change my answer even when I still have time left. The platform needs to better support the number of players that are logged on at the same time, or have a limit to the number of players so that it doesn't freeze. Cannot play properly."

If \"Second Chance\" feature were removed or didn't play ads, this would be an easy recommended purchase. As is I advise you not to pay money, because it doesn't did what you expect it to.",

        "The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says \"combo broken\" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!",
        "I really enjoy this game. Ive maxed out purchases on tracks n cars, modified them all. Now its TOO hard to gain coins to open cars and much exciting tracks.. no updates on additional tracks.. think the optjons should be reviewed. Its now once you get where you are the only way to gain more is to go online to TRY and get coins to get anywhere... which sucks!!!!!",
        "This game won't let me purchase anything. Everytine I start the app I get the \"validation error\" pop-up. I've sent mails to support, left multiple comments but nothing happens. I just get ignored. I am truly over his game with the level of support I am receiving, which is absolutely ZERO!",
        "One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.",
        "I think it should have ALOT more cars. I also think that they should alow custom decals and visual upgrades. Also a better online platform. Like a real time multiplayer. Other then that it's an OK game.  Its not been over a year and...it seems like they update this game every...6-7 months, really bad. Gets reallly boring 🤦🏽\u200d♂️",
        "Love the game! But since the update I'm unable to purchase cars/cash. Every time I open the game it says I need to connect to the internet to make purchases even though I'm connected and can still play multiplayer etc. Any help would be great"

I will only play with the coins this game allow me thank you",

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "Honestly, this is the best game I have ever played. It's very addicting and I think I have a very high IQ because I have beat four out of five levels in less than 3 seconds. Longest level I've played is maybe 15 seconds. I have beat the first two sets of 50 levels within about 10 to 15 minutes. I'm curious, you know how there are game runners who beat games in a record time? Is there some kind of game Runner tournament or any challenges for this game? I am beat this game completely in arecord time. Thank you developer for making the best game ever. This game can actually bring out the genius in anyone. Btw, I haven't used any hints also, I'm impressing myself... Yay!!!😎😎😎",
        "\"contains ads\" is an understatement! unless you plan on paying, dont bother.  you play a stage for 5 to 10 seconds and get an ad after EVERY SINGLE STAGE! AND THE ADS USE DATA.  videos. long ones. spammy. uninstalled.    i would have maybe paid if the game did not turn me off so quickly with their ridiculous amount of ads that made me annoyed instead. so i uninstalled instead of getting far in, and rewarding dev with $$$.",
        "Dumbest game ever! A silly trick is enough to complete 20 stages in 5 mins. Trick -&gt; Just extend the start point to the direction which you cant cover by a whole traversal! Oh forgot to tell you, out of that 5 mins, 2-3 minute is just ads!",
        "It's a cool game where you outplayed every other game on your phone and it helps to kill time when you're going somewhere or just waiting on someone or class to start.",
        "I love this game when I'm feeling stressed or stuck on a project I start to play and it relaxes me enough to get my creative juices flowing again",
        "I don't have anything else like it, and so far its a much different kind of challenge then I'm used to."

        "Frickin amazing game! Extremely relaxing puzzle solver, no flashy game elements, simple and elegant. Great soundtrack and easy to difficult levels. Highly recommended. It did stutter for some reason on one of the levels on my galaxy s8, kept flickering for some reason but I forced closed it and restarted and no more issues. Really good job devs!",
        "It's simple yet complicated. It calms my nerves and I initially downloaded it to help me fall asleep. I wanted something that I could mindlessly do and not mess up if I pressed the wrong buttons. But it's also challenging enough to make me think. The graphics are simple yet colorful :)",
        "Good fun and keeps you wanting another round of play. Seems to be easier as you go through, however I'm only 40 plays in, and things may change?.  I hope so. I'll be sure to play on to find out. Can't stop now! THANKS FOR A STRONG GAMEPLAY.",
        "The game is quiet, relaxing, soothing, and all around great to play. I know the advertisements that are played aren't their choice but that's the only downside. After a few rounds you'll get an ad that is excessively loud if your volume is up. The content of the game is great, the ad placement is not.",
        "Indescribable. This game offers a break from reality into a Vista of entertainment. I play hours and hours on end of this game trying to finish that one level. To the people who made this game. Hats off. Absolutely brilliant and I suggest it to everyone looking to spend their entire life playing a masterpiece",
        "Great puzzles. Soothing music in the back to enhance thinking. 2 different modes. Didn't notice that at first. Its pretty cool. I like it. How do I prove this isn't a paid for comment? Idk but I promise I'm real. Try it out. I haven't made it too far but the puzzles are growing in difficulty."

This way your progress won't be lost. If you face further issues reach us by e-mail.Do I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop?No. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. Only if you opt for the secondary game, called \"black mode\", you may need to pay a coffee for it after level 100.I don't feel the game is challenging. Why?The challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now.

And it is just what it says it is it's just a game like we played When We Were Young remember Cowboys and Indians this is the same thing I had a slingshot when I was young I think every little boy did it's harmless. It does not teach your child to become a murderer.",

        "I am deleting this for several reasons. 1, the physics are not real. A person's hand doesn't move like that. 2, there is an ad after just about every level. Short, but still annoying. And 3, I think a company that can't take the time to respond to it's feedback isn't worth it.",

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",

Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. 😟",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",

My wife bought \"180\"  twice thinking she may have made a mistake the first time and only ended up with about 300 total. She already had quite a few to begin with. Ripoff!"

        "Fun but won't let me access game without forcing me to open w.w.f. 2 in play store. Constant McDonald's ads pop up where next game button is that trick you into clicking the McDonald's app in play store. If it wasn't for that I would love it but I foresee myself deleting because with time because of that.",
        "Seems pretty hopeless. When I try to sign in, it sends me a password reset email. When I click the link it takes me back to the app, same screen. Result: endless loop. Like others I can't retrieve what I paid for and they want us to use Words 2. This tells you all you need to know about their business model. Just look at all the 1 star reviews rolling in, but they probably don't care.",
        "App used to be 3.5 MB's now it's 100+MB's. Optimization based on my apps setting should never have been defaulted to on. That was/is real sneaky.  Your video ads are out of control. I will only play one game at a time and exit immediately after move to evade ads. You show update messages when none exist. Notification icon always shows 2+ when I only play one game at a time.",
        "I  tried to reinstall Words  but I  couldn't  recall  my previous  password.  It won't  allow  me  to  reset  it. If I  try to  access the  game  via Facebook,  it wants to  connect  with  my friends and  set up Words2 which I don't  want. When I was able to play the Solo game, 2 minutes  was too long to wait for  my turn. Enjoyed this game but will have to uninstall since I can't login.",
        "I love your Game! There are glitches at times!  Otherwise, well-designed!   1. Please, Fix the Solo Game Glitch: It doesn't return the play and Times itself Out! Happened several times now! It simply is Not working reliably!   2. Also, please Return the Safety measure of Asking whether I want to make the Play of a Word I've marked! Sometimes, I've accidentally pushed 'Play' while meaning to return or move the letters! Too easy to do with the Touch Phone!! Or, allow to Undo the Play turn within the few minutes of making it!   A wonderful game on the whole!"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

I don't mind the cost for some extra packs. I am having issues with being able to watch videos for hints, though. Just gets caught at 5he loading screen.",
        "Update destroyed the UI. It was hard enough to play one handed as it was, now the smaller icons and narrower sidebar make it even more difficult. Also, longer item names like atmosphere now get truncated at the edge of the screen because the sidebar is too narrow. Either add an option to switch back to the larger layout, or add a left-handed mode with the UI mirrored horizontally. Basically unplayable while multitasking now.",
        "Fun game and addicting but pretty pointless. Please add internationalization!  I used the original one as a vocabulary discovery app thanks to the availability of multiple languages. I would have expected at least one other language for a \"sequel\"!  Otherwise it's really just a time waster (which is fine, but way less cool)",
        "LOVE this game! I honestly didn't ever expect an update and I was fine with it. The game was perfectly complete but I'm really happy they revisited some things because there were a couple things that were a bit wonky, like Liquid and Solid never worked like you'd expect them to. Solid+Water= Ice but Ice+Liquid doesn't = Water. I'm not sure what exactly they changed, but I'm just glad that the developers are still involved in it.",

        "Guys, I loved this game. The game is very sophisticated and deeply planned. The developer made an outstanding work and put so many little details. I loved how scoring system works. At the end you see result of your choices, and every single little detail make a contribution to your colony's final situation. Kudos to developer, far making an app I haven't liked this much and satisfied for a long time.",
        "By far my favorite game. But maybe you could add a 'visit planet' option where you could where you could gather resources for repairs or send out some colonists to study ruins and gather information for the databases. And maybe add a way to survive a fall into a black hole and it sends you to another dimension that has different game mechanics. Idk I'm not a developer but these are just a few ideas that I had. I love the game tho, it's super fun.",
        "Idk. I just like it. It's fun. I got one ship to a planet with so much of their science and culture data still intact plus some from an alien ship so after landing on this perfect planet with a resource rich moon they all transcended this reality. That's my best yet. Worst yet was when they crashed on descent cause there wasn't anymore landing gear and everyone who was t dead already died",
        "I was a little apprehensive about the game at first, as I'm not big on text adventures. But this one did it for me. Absolutely amazing concept and I keep playing it over and over again. If you haven't thought of it yet, it would be cool to play a text adventure after they've landed.",
        "Simple easy to use text. Hard to put down. Maybe new worlds will come in the next up date. Along with some more choices to deal with like a paasanger awakens early do to space madness or is awaken from outside disturbance,Sickness ect..*****",
        "The new update mostly introduces events where the best case scenario is nothing happens, and the worst case scenario is the player suffers catastrophic losses. These new events further unbalance a game where you're already harshly punished for consequences and bad luck."

        "Great game, great idea. But, when you have even 2 workshops, notification for broken machines are really annoying. Every few minutes a long vibrate which I cant turn off... What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",
        "Candy crush, soda crush, & candy crush jellies cuts off for no apparent reason while in gameplay. The game has done that on 4 different devices.",
        "Constantly crashes and freezes taking everything I have away. I took a screenshot but of course I can't post it because it would prove the game doesn't work",
        "TOP GROSSING!?! YES OF COURSE, bc WE'RE ALL STUPID! I'm playin a level w/ the Monklings, like 124/6 if u watch closely if u catch a long, 6,7,8, row on Monklings KING WILL NOT ALLOW U TO HAVE THE WHOLE row. Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",
        "I love this game a lot. In fact, I like all of the candy crush games. But when will the show come back? Also, when can we play against the Jelly Queen again?"

You can spin any game, at any bet level, even buy more chips but the payouts absolutely disappear. It will  happen to you, trust me.  Beware of Jackpot Party!  THEY FLEECE THEIR PLAYERS!",

I wonder if your advertisers know you block videos from playing. I could understand if it were for real money but this is (WAS) my bathroom game.",

        "I use to actually win back in the day on this app but now it's about impossible. Also the ad videos for free coins is a complete scam !!!! You receive 200k coins which is basically a spin and you will not win. All free coins from ads will not produce any wins. Please tell me there is not a different payout percentage off the ad coins. But you're making real money from us watching  the ad. Mmmmmmmm....",

        "Like so many other games like this out there it is\"pay to win\". This is nearly every \"free\" mobile game it there now. So why the 5 stars? A few reasons. A big one being that they do make the super currency accessible without paying via offers. Many of which rewards higher amount than what someone would come to expect just for making it a fair ways into other games.  Second is that the levelling system is fair and no content is truly locked for those who don't pay. It will just take you a little longer to get what you want if you don't but it won't be excluding you from the best content.   As for the game itself is alright. You collect heroes and you can engage in a variety of activities. From a campaign mode and it's associated elite version to random dungeons to guild wars, pvp, and a gauntlet. Overall you can kill however much time you want on this game. Once you start attaining higher levels you will find it easier to spend more and more time on content.  Finally as always I strongly recommend doing a Google search too learn best strategies.",

It will repeat the words several times even if you get them right and by the end of a session you're certain to remember the idea expressed by a word. For each answer they display the word in context so that you are not confused by the place of the word in the sentence. If you don't know the pronunciation it has a sound file next to it once you answer so no worries as to your pronunciation of the newly acquired word.   You can also play against online users. It is timed so it adds intensity to the game but don't expect anything thrilling. It's a simple app designed to help you acquire new words and thus ways to express yourself.",

They are so much nicer looking and easier to spot than the new ones you tried in February. Thank u 4listening to feedback.",

        "Not really easy to understand how to get started playing the game. I had to figure out a lot of it for myself but having to do that got frustrating so after a few days I just decided to uninstall it. It presents as cute and entertaining but trying to learn a game with minimal instruction doesn't give a great first impression",
        "This is one of my favorite mobile games. My only issue recently is I spent money on coins after a level to finally finish it but the game crashed and I ended up having to start the game over smh it keeps crashing but this is the first time it crashed without fixing itself...hope you guys do something about that",
        "Update: I read where you stated\" Our developers only release levels after they personally ensure that levels  are beatable without the use of purchase's\".  I was wondering, do they play a level for a week like I am so far trying to complete it? Are they really playing or it's what the computer tells them? I doubt that any of you are actually playing this game.",
        "I have played this game for months and it was fantastic until the last 2 updates. After those the levels became so hard it's impossible to beat them without spending money. If you enjoy playing the same level for weeks at a time then by all means download. Otherwise don't waste your time unless you want to spend money.",
        "Fun game but today while I have been playing, when I hit give up it keeps going to the 25 coins for 5 more moves no matter how many times I hit it. I have had to exit the app and reopen it to play the level again without spending coins. I hope this is just a glitch and not trying to get people to spend more money.",
        "I love this game however, it has taken multiple lives from me for no reason. The game starts you off with 5 lives & then I accrued 10 lives from winning multiple lives from extra spins. All of a sudden the lives just disappeared and I was reduced to just 5 lives again. This is the 2nd time this happened to me which sucks cause the game is fun as hell."

And the most silly tyings are about those relics/chests/shells, where they have very big power compared to other real big fish, and they can jump out from the water like a blue marlin. Gosh....what the heck....LOL 😂😂😂😂",
        "I'm only at level 3 but it's great so far!!! You know how I can best describe it? Its like one of those deer or bear or dinosaur (I'm pretty sure they have dinosaur too now lol) shooting games...the ones that have the siiick graphics and the rifle upgrades as u go along... Only this is with fish... And a fishing pole!!! Other then that it's pretty similar to one of those... only with this one u get different tanks to keep ur catches in if u want.. or u can sell em 🤣 I'm happy so far!!!",

        "The graphic are great and the gameplay is fun but what kept me going was the writing. At first I was like uhhh another newspaper? Those don't do anything... But I kept reading and they are GREAT. On the lower side, the drones often clip in building and can't be clicked or you click straight on it but get sent to a building screen instead and by the time you get back, the fast drones are gone.",
        "Soul eggs are incredibly buggy. On the higher level eggs you can go from earning 10s a sec to 1 a sec just by closing the app. The extra soul eggs through epic research when you prestige isn't clear enough and doesn't match the description. Later game is very much about waiting for a counter to hit one billion which means you don't need to open the app all that much. Other than that, it's ok.",
        "Very good game overall, relaxing and good to play if you have a short period of free time. The only thing I would say is I wish opening the piggy bank didn't cost REAL money because I have thousands of golden eggs in it but I can't get them out because I don't want to spend money. Maybe make it that you have to spend TONS of the in-game money to open it. I would rate this 4/5 stars, as I thoroughly enjoy it.",
        "Great stuff, cool graphics and awesome story writing. A nice time passing game. Would have given 5 stars if a little more improvement was made. Bug - When you tap on the box when it is being thrown by the courier van, the dialog shifts up to the to of the screen, overlapping the cash counter. Suggestion - The whole farm area should be easily scrollable. Also, you could put in an option to zoom out to fit the whole farm on the screen.",
        "I play the game all the time, but it needs easier and faster prestige. Three days of waiting for the next egg is bs with a prestige score of almost 1,000,000. Also \"silos\" hardly earn anything. That's my main complaint. Fix it so they earn WAY more over non play or I'm done and I've actually spent money so if you still want that, fix it.",
        "Fun and simple game that lets you gradually grow your farm at your own speed. This is a game you can play from once a week where you collect the money you've collected offline, buy upgrades, then leave the game for another week; to spending a few casual hours of hunting for the drones that give you extra money and gold eggs which are the games micro-transaction currency to buy permanent upgrades that help your farm grow faster. It not so much a race as it is just enjoying your farm steadily grow over time."

        "I love your games. The graphics and controls are great and I would give it 5 stars but the gameplay is rediculous.  You cannot keep any credit regardless of how many you have and that is very frustrating!!  My game is over as soon as I begin almost.  I \"might\" get to play for 10 minutes but that's only if I get lucky and fix a game that's winning right from the beginning.  I have even purchased credits several times and that has only made it worse!  I cannot keep purchasing credits for a game that only wants to take and doesn't last, nor should I have to.  Please work on this issue because other than that, you have a phenomenal system and I'm going to try to be patient and hope I get to see a difference.    Thank You!",
        "Game not playing , its up to date but no updates available so i can get my daily credits which is 7plus day in if it doesnt sort itself by midnight it will take me back to day 1 im not impressed",

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",

Contact me as soon as possible.",

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",

        "It is awesome!! So addictive! My only problem is that I would lol there to be more things to colour. But if that sacrifices the quality, I can live without more",
        "Absolutely adore this app! Terrific colors and artwork. I would like a palette of brown colors. I think something we could go to for tips about which colors look well together and how to make our colors go from light to dark (like in the ad pictures) would be cool to have",
        "The upgrades were awesome. I just wish that there was a way to fade the colors from one to another within game mode . Thx guy ur killing it"

        "Used to be five stars now 1.  FIX THE DOWNLOAD ISSUE WITH THE SPRING UPDATE!   Listen to your customers and at least acknowledge that you might be working on solving the problem.  Not responding at all is horrendous customer service.  Will be deleting the game shortly if not fixed.",
        "Sometimes I would give it a five star other times 4 star. Good number of challenge keys per visit to none challenge sites. As few as two visits needed for one visit to challenge site in final level of challenge (requiring 25keys). Love the two modes for cards of fate. No time limit but fewer tries works great if you write down what you find. It surprisingly has improved my timed play of this mini game. There are getting to be too many items and NO search functions to facilitate where to find a particular item, what collection items belong to if someone wants it and you don't want to send it anonymously (case if you send a requested item) and don't send it from the gift bar. One of the better hide and find games.",
        "I changed my previous rating. There are so many glitches, especially with new events  and support doesn't respond to requests. I haven't gotten totem bonuses for three days and new event is nearly impossible at times to find bunnies and objects. This used to be my \"go to\" stress reliever but now it just creates more stress.",
        "Instead of relaxing me this game stresses the hell out of me. New bunny location is extremely hard to find the 🐇. And the time limit is too short. I know im wasting my time writing this cause I've seen a lot people complaining about it and nothing is been done. Will be unistalling if it doesn't gets fix. Good day",
        "The main complaint is that some tasks have insanely short timers, like for the new event where you have to find optionnal stuff that's really well hidden as well as the usual pack of items that usually takes the whole timer to find. Great game, bases itself too much on money dropping.",
        "The only thing I don't like about the game is that by the time you search a couple of places (depending on ur level) is how long you have to wait to get enough energy up to search again. Depending on what you want to search it can take up to an hour or more to get the requirements. Other than that I really like the game."

I love anime and I love how you can chat with your friends. But if you touch the person in the menu like when you touch the Tummy when your on to the next heart. Can she PLEASE say *Baka! Watashi no yo ni watashi ni furenaide kudasai!* If you know what this means. Your Game is very fun ;)",

What i mean by that is, almost all of the items are being sold by gold tickets (which i cant top-up) . please add more items that can be bought by silver coins.. I have like 16.5k on my acc and i have nthing to buy... Please read this and make this possible ..if possible thankyou..!",
        "I have been waiting for a game like this since DayZ. I am truly addicted to playing this game. I do however wish that after you get shot and knocked down that you would have a chance to restore health rather than die. But I do understand that if that were the case, the games would last a lot longer. I love the game, the graphics are as good as could be expected for a mobile device but the game play is so fun!! Great job!",
        "Amazing game Absolutely fantastic on my tablet, iPhone has mega lag so maybe your issue is your devices @laggy users. No complaints graphics are better than rules of survival, less stuff to pick up, but smoother game play, instant match making 90% of the time, great community, constant improvements, very very happy with this game. Spending money has no point other than style and bragging rights no effect on in game play.",
        "Great game, very addictive! But a lot of hackers in the game, making the game unfair. Hackers usually performs: 1 shot kill Goes under ground and kill you while you can't shoot back Unlimited health See through obstacles I hope the game developers would update and get rid of those hacks",
        "Nice job developers! After that small update you've screwed up the loading screen! There's isn't a start button and other selections like shop, warehouse, etc those are bugged out also. Next time, tell us when there's an update even those small ones its happens unexpected. Fix it ASAP",
        "I think this game has more things than other games but the graphics is some how really i can't describe it. It is good and it is not just like that. That is the describtion.... I joined today and  played with squed and i won the game me only. Hope you will enjoy this game and happy wishes all of you"

And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Awesome It's a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)",
        "Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "Great game, me and the family enjoy it immensely and we have all made our contribution, thank you. The controls in card battles on the phone are too fiddly, considering there is a lot of unused space on the screen: this would have been developed differently if it wasn't attempting to mimic the desktop version. Lazy! Is the \".. playing over WiFi...\" warning still relevant? Unlimited mobile data and 4g means many of us have as good a connection as fixed line. Love the game, thank you.",
        "This is an awesome game I play it be very day and I had two games I would always play now I don't even play them at all because this game is so awesome and I kinda play it to much.  But I did get my last account deleted for some reason I was mad and couldn't get it back so I had to create a new one",
        "Everytime I play a club arena game (free every 24hours) it will keep telling me i disconnected from the game while my Internet connection is fine. But when I play other normal arena games, it turns out fine. I find it very annoying because i have to wait 24 hours to play my favourite club games and it always disconnects, and it makes me mad. I hope you notice this comment and leave a reply... Please fix this... Thanks :(  Edit: It works fine now, thank you! :)",
        "Very fun game, my most played game by far but the major issue in this game is hackers. You get good and start to play the end gamers and realize 90% of them are bots with millions of coins and as soon as the game starts you are sent balloons to your side that cannot be activated until round 15+! It's frustrating to earn my coins legit just to have them taken by all the hackers and bots. Ruins the game when makers aren't doing anything about it.",
        "I LIKE IT BUT IT WOULD BE WAY BETTER IF U ADD MORE MONKEYS AN IF THE BATTLE THAT U PAY 100 TO GET 200 MEDALIONS WONT GO AWAY NUT STILL COOL PLZ ADD MORE STUFF LIKE MONLEYS",
        "The Mob defense ruins the game. Can't lose when you have them maxed out."

I am on  stage 890 and have been wondering if i will ever get to the tree top. Review by player indicated that he is on stage 3410. That takes playing.",

        "I love this app because it's just enough of a challenge so it can be done without being boring or getting so frustrated your ready to throw your phone across the room.  It isn't rigged to fail like so many games today!  UPDATE:  I've just reached level 1,600 and still enjoy the game every much as I did from level 1!  I honestly can't say that about any other game.  This is a great game for just passing the time, or challenge yourself to get 3 stars by studying all possible ways to complete the task.  YOU choose how much effort to put into it.",

The AI got worse at the same time, so it's not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.",

        "I love these games, really, and I was on a roll, but I can't get pass level 48 because my Wiko LENNY3 touch screen isn't responsive enough to register both fingertips at the same time. EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can't wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.",
        "Not a bad game by any means, but the \"meh\" rating is due to how short the game is. You'll download it, play it for a bit, and then it'll suddenly be over. I didn't mind that some of the puzzles were too easy, while others seemed a bit too vague (nearly forcing a hint), but what I did mind was how few puzzles there were. 50 puzzles doesn't sound too small a number until you realize over half the puzzles are completed idly in a few seconds.",
        "Brilliant follow-up to YELLOW! ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! And, there ARE games trying to pretend that they're the same...only Bart Bonte does it right!  I try not to let myself do too many levels at once, just so I can extend the game. I can't wait for the next color!",
        "This game and yellow have single handedly improved my relationship with my niece. She loves playing these games over and over every time she comes to visit. Christmas day she didn't want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.",
        "By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another \"Yellow 2\", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)",
        "Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I'm familiar with Bart's mind by now. &lt;3 I think it's great that clues are available though and that they don't give everything away right away. It's a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!"

The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)",

This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It's not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you've got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable."

        "I have played this game for years now. Great new levels, still challenging, and fun ways to earn power-ups without having to make a purchase! Loved it until it quit working on my phone. Doesn't even crash anymore, just quits mid-play and I lose whatever progress I'd made. I play when I can on my tablet, but it's just not the same. I don't know why it won't work on my phone without spontaneously closing! 5 stars if it did...",
        "I love, love  this game is difficult to play, but to my opinion is the best game on line ihave been playing for 2 years and my goal is to beat it . you get rewards. I spend money but with the rewards you get something back  ,also I just started another game with is similar like pandapop and iam a also give it 5 stars . even that iam a grandmother of 72 years old. I still popping. !!",
        "A wonderful game to have very fun and exciting install right away you won't regret it. I've reached level 1049. It is super exciting to me learning how to Ricochet the balls off the walls. The projection of the angle need it. This is my all-time favorite and I highly recommend it to my friends and family. Plus, the little bit of flaws and the enemies within the game, will have you taking a break and coming back for more. Just know that I've deleted this game twice but always came back to it because this game , is fun and challenging .  If you don't like a challenge you won't like this game .  Just so you know , it does not require internet, to be able to play this game like others. Technicians please put out more games that don't need the Internet to play. This game is one of them. Just know that option is super helpful. We need more games able to be played without internet intervention. Ty taking time to read this. Have fun a Poppin. LOL",
        "Not bad, not great. Randomly stops in the middle of play and you lose a life. Also takes a long time to load and to move to the next level. Okay for free, but if I paid for it I would be asking four a refund.  Update: I've contacted the developers multiple times. They keep sending the same canned response.  Game crashes frequently. Frustrating when you are just about to finish a level. Uninstalling.",
        "I use to give this a 5 star rating until I lost all of my panda belt progress when I updated, 5 days ago. I sent a report to you and got a message that said there was a problem with the update. I'm still waiting for an answer on when this will be fixed. I refuse to play any levels or specisls, like badboon lair until I can receive the panda belt credits. If I don't receive the panda belt credits or if I am not credited for the points that I lost I will uninstall this game!!!!!",
        "I loved this game and have played it for a few years now. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the last few months, it just closes on me mid play and I lose on my progress, as well as any items and special powers that I used to advance in a level. Very frustrating to lose items and have to start all over on the level."

They stayed in contact, gave a time that an update should be in place, and even compensated me with a nice sorry for the inconveniences package. Which I wasn't expecting or requesting in anyway. So great game and better customer support than most other mobile developers",

        "Beware: Some of the ads won't close when they've finished playing, so you've to close the whole game and lose whatever progress you have made so far. Mediocre and repetitive gameplay that is not worth mentioning; have tried better ones.",

        "It was good at the beginning then I  got to a high level and it started kicking me out. I still have the same problem. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it even went onto their Facebook page and explain but there was still no fix. I give this game 2 stars. No point in trying to advance if problem is not fixed.",
        "It's a great game.  The problem I have is you get screwed out of your prizes from time to time.  And then when you contact support you have to wait for 2 days.  Then you get a message assuming you dont understand how the game works and a thanks for understanding.  So the poor customer support is what got this game it's 2 stars from me and the prize screws.",
        "Good game but... I played it on my tablet then it broke so I bought a phone insted and downloaded it again so I can play it but then when ever I tried play it I would finish the tutorial then it would crash imedetly after😩😩😩 please fix Ludia I LOVE the game there's no better dinosaur game out there!!!😍😍😍I would LOVE to play the game and become a subscriber to the game # number 1 fan!!!!!!!",
        "Well Ludia tnx for having those patches disappear. But what about having lesser price for like, poor countries??? I mean it is hard for us to buy because its always that high priced. So can you make adjustments??? I am just thinking....🙏",
        "I love this game from the bottom of my heart but I have some problems like matchmaking in tournaments it can get annoying but still enjoyable at times but honestly it can get unfair is it about the level of your park or the dinosaurs because I'm confused but still I love this game thank you ludia"

I could play this for a whole day and think 10 minutes just went by! I loved this app so much! Thank you for making a good app. Well... I have nothing else to say except It's amazing, I suppose I'll play it for another hour!   I Liked it!",

Often loud vidoes wasting data. I do not recomend you download this blatant addware app. Its fun and novelty quickly gets replaced with advertisement. And you become a monkey watching adds rather than participating a very simple game of would you rather.",

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played and ever will play. I recommend it to everyone. Even if it doesn't look good to you get it its awsome. I think or know you will like it. Also it's so cute and the graphics are awsome. Also everything is priced so well. I love how you add new stuff often. Also you can level up fast, and let go of your purse into a new family. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!,",
        "OMG THE NEW UPDATE IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY SAW MY OLD REVIEW AND DID ALMOST EVERYRHING I ASKED THEM TO DO OMG LOL XD GREAT GAME!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁 COULD NOT B HAPPIER ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! 😝 Edit: ANOTHER AWSOME UPDATE!!! BEST WOLF SIM IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!! 😆 😆 😆 😀 😁 😁 I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN I LOVE MINECRAFT AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING COMING FROM ME!! 😀 😀 😀 😀 😃 😃 😆 😆 😗 😘 😘 I LOVE U TURBO ROCKET GAMES!! 😘 😘"

Also I had the manitory jump off and I could not jump over one checker but then I reallize that there was a double jump and also that a king can jump everyone but i apparely couldn't do it. This game needs alot of work.",

        "Too long per word I agree with the other reviewers. My kids were giggling as they picked out each sight word the first 15 times, but by 20 they were asking if it was done yet. Is there a way to shorten the levels if the kids are getting 100% accuracy? They got through the first couple words, but now they never want to play.",
        "Rubbish I'm an adult and I found this massively infuriating let alone my kids!!! Its poor! Constantly closing for no good reason and having to progress full through the level just completed to unlock the new level. Not a good app!!!!",
        "Kids lose interest very fast Had high hopes for this game from what I've heard about it but my son's lost interest very quickly because it takes way too long for the right words to come on the screen. I would have paid for the full version if this one was good.",
        "Love it, but..... I don't understand why it doesn't save the levels. So every day he opens that up he has to redo everything. He loves it but comes to me and says that he's tired of doing level's 1-8 all the time.                Can you please make it so it can save??",
        "Kids aren't going to learn it by seeing or hearing it once, I like that it repeats. I think people lack patience these days. My only concern is some words fly across the screen too fast even I missed some and you lose a life. If that can be fixed I'd rate 5*"

So I will give it sadly a 👎.",

        "WAY too many ads.  play 30 seconds, then watch a one minute ad.  Dont really know if i would like the game or not, i never got to play much of it, spent most of my time watching and trying to closeout ads.",
        "First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕",
        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver."

I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it's the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!😀",
        "Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!",
        "Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn't deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it's to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.",
        "it is so good and not at all for the people who think their bains are going to be trained in a day. better than other apps. although I found an error in Memory Match level. when we click on an already shown image twice then the image becomes distorted also after giving multiple clicks it goes to normal so moves left and time left both decrease simultaneously. please check on the issue. rest other levels and games are superb.",
        "It's fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I've failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.",
        "I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on \"memory match\" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it's worth installing."

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",

I'm not saying everything should be cheap and easy, but should increase cash values or offer other ways to earn cash.",

And the camera (free camera) followed the truck perfectly in order to see the suspension moving with the terain. Now the camera does not stay where you want it. Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics. I unistalled other games because this is all I spent time with. But now I dont know?",
        "nice! im waiting for long time for the game like this... and this is it. but, please add more common truck like nissan navara, toyota hilux vigo & revo, mitsubishi triton, ford ranger 3.2, isuzu dmax.. and also please fix the mud graphic to more realistic.. thanks..",
        "Hey devs, great game, I think a winter map or just more maps would be awesome as well as an option to sell vehicles rather than just collect them. Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",
        "This game suck because it never work it always lags out and every time it says loading trailer it goes back to my home screen. In my review i mean all of this and hope ypu make your game better so it doesn't suck but for now it does suck.",
        "This game is literally what I have been looking for. This is the perfect offroad game. I just wish that there were A LOT more maps and vehicles to chose from. It's boring to constantly go to the same maps. Also the multiplayer is pretty fun. Expand the maps and create new ones please!"

However, after the first ten levels it becomes an infuriating cacophony of balancing your bridge on rocks and mountains without anchor points and hanging your bridge from hot air balloons. Levels become so frustratingly impossible that you are forced to watch the videos for hints to get enough stars to progress.",

It may have adds but they are expected in a free to play mobile app. The adds are easily controlled and aren't annoying at all as they can be easily closed and come in moderation. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are cool and it's very fun and addicting. Perfect to pass time. The developers done a great job, hope for me great games made big these guys.",

        "Whatever you did to the graphics in the last update literally hurts my eyes. I tried playing, but the headache bonus is bogus. And why is the xp tally after finishing a round so damn loud now? Why was that necessary? I uninstalled finally. After years, there's just no way I can ignore your ruining of the game. You do realize you're not #1, right? It clearly says #5 on the app store page. You're not even #1 on iOS. lol Where are you #1 exactly?",
        "Hate the new update. When playing 4 cards, you now have to switch between screens and I have missed bingos and extra points. Is there any way to uninstall new update? Also, all the extras are missing from the screen. Where has the inventory gone? To see chat, you now have to click on the icon, then it takes up the whole screen. What makes this update better? I dont get it",
        "Latest update is horrible. Now I only have 2 cards per screen and have to scroll during game. If there is a way to get all 4 cards on one screen then you need to explain how to get it back. Also no longer says how manybingos are available when round starts. Tremendously bad update. This game went from one of the best to one of the worst. Please fix",
        "Since this game updated in feb i cant play 4 cards as explained in so many emails to bingo support. No one helps the problem dont get fixed im tired of this how can you have a support group that dont help at all. But you want good ratings for your game this is pathetic really. Im not gona issue another ticket or send emails. I think this is the worst support ive ever received",
        "To many glitches. Constantly freezing. Having 2 refresh is off putting.  Duplicates of shadow cards is ridiculous.  4 / 5 of same items. Slots don't pay out. Collecting stickers is a joke. U get the same 1s not the 1s u need. I don't spend money on games .would not waste my money",
        "It would let me play before I had to update again. I click on the open button then it comes up saying that my internet connection is not working.This game has never done this before. I just want to play my bingo games."

        "Literally unplayable. Game pauses itself in the middle of races multiple times. I am nowhere near touching the paise button and even went as far as to place my phone on the ground and touch the phone with only one finger on the accelerate button. SOMEHOW the game pauses itself 7 times during that race. Uninstalling.",
        "It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could \"ditch the glitch\" so to speak. Thanks",
        "So hard to beat the game. I'm not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can't buy anything in shop without real money.",
        "Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win",
        "Been playing for a few years and about to quit because every time I have a lead my bike goes forward by itself and starts glitching. Almost feels like I'm being cheated out of a good run. Maybe it's because I don't pay to play. Please fix or I'm deleting!",
        "The one thing that wrecks the game for me is the little hangup glitches that happen constantly.  You need to be precise to win races, and it's pretty hard to do that when the game is always stuttering.  Running on a brand new MotoZ2 Play, btw."

I love the game to bits, ive played it for like 10 years! So im guna wait for a new update with thr bug fix !",

        "- Update: Really struggling with the game at the moment. Lots of problems that other people are also experiencing. I think the glitches need fixing before a new storyline is rolled out. - Still my favourite premium game. Can be played without any extra purchases. New characters and items are obtainable during special events and donuts can be earned doing regular daily tasks. Special event storylines are well written and keep within Simpsons humour. A highly recommended past time that will take over most of your spare time."

        "It looks good and the gameplay is fun. Unfortunately that fun only lasts so long before the game devolves into micro transaction hell. Each round gets so expensive that I can only play one or two unless I were to buy coin packs. These guys should be ashamed.",
        "Really fun game but costs too many credits to play and the extra five cards and wild are over priced considering the cost of credits per game round. Could be better if these issues get resolved I would edit my review to five stars all around.",
        "It is a fun game. BUT, the levels cost so many coins that it's very slow. Unless you plan to pay real money or can win every level 1st try, expect to play maybe 1 game an hour.",
        "Great game...however sometimes no matter what you do the cards just don't allow a win. Gets a bit aggravating when that happens. Eats up all your points real fast."

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

The translation is spotty but works good enough for me.",

You scrounge up a few caps for expensive items you need to survive, just to realize that something else is needed, but no longer obtainable. It's literally a game of waiting to die. There are no options to make the next game go smoother, or any progress. Bethesda would be ashamed, that is if you even have their permission to use the content that clearly isn't yours.",

        "So far, not bad.  Update:  gathered enough parts to repair the university and it won't unlock.  I emailed the developer and haven't heard back.  It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can't use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great game with good potential. I love it. But there are still some minor bugs the car baler somtimes acts weird. And the dismantling process sometimes goes reverse. And then there is the part of collecting building materials. It is too hard and we need to be able to get building materials from elsewhere than the scrap cars. All of them including wood, bricks, and concrete. I am looking forward to the car repair function.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly"

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

The updates are very slow you have to wait for a while if you've gotten to a certain level,  that sucks for a real gamers.. Hopefully they get around to updating new levels faster. until then I guess I'll download something  else like chess.. Hopefully there's no long wait for updates there!",

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Great game, I totally love it. I don't mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills."

Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game. Literaly all have similar characteristic +1 and +5 etc. And what is the point to collect other characters? For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different. You can reword weapon for rank, rank 5 win something, rank 10, 15, 20...",

        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers",
        "This game is a lot of fun, really addictive and completely free to play. Of course you can buy stuff if you want, but it's not necessary.   Multiple game modes, a ton of upgrades.   This is a good one."

        "Since last update I can't hit a ball to save my life, what's happened?  Some of the views are misleading so you are unable to aim your shots properly.  Also there is a degree of inconsistency with shot making so room for improvement.   Takes forever to get enough credits to improve clubs unless you spend money..  most of the offers to get credits either don't work or if taking surveys you won't be accepted.",

        "I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I have to say, I didn't have high hopes when I started. 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop and I wanted to play more. It's a different take on a Final Fantasy game, and it really does feel like a Dissidia game in RPG form. The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

        "I love this game. It's the closest thing to tap tap revenge I've ever found. A few notes though:  There is so much lag that it seriously impedes gameplay I really like having a customizable Avatar like ttr3 I don't really like how the notes jump into the button and stay there, I like when it's smoother.  Other than that I would say this is a great game!",
        "OHMYF*CKING GOD 🤓 the nostalgia! I used to play this game back in high school and I've been saying for years that it needs to come back now that smart phones are a thing! This game is amazing and very well done, the song choices are fantastic and catchy and they've added in some extra controls during game play compared to the older tap tap.   I am so happy! Thank you developers! 😍",
        "I have loved the tap tap series way before revolution came out. I started playing this and have already noticed a problem regarding gameplay. As you play, there is the unlucky event of all the hit buttons missing, and reappearing again just for you to lose your combo, and generally lose the game. Just a little problem I have.",
        "The only issue I have with this game is as a mobile game it is flawed. Naturally since it is vertical I hold it with two hands and play with two thumbs, making the triples (one note on every part) very hard to get all perfects on. Other that truly a fun game.",
        "Its really fun and I love it, but there's a few issues. Song packs are advertised as reduced price but it's still the same price. Some songs are cut short and I don't get to play the full thing. And some good songs just have awful level design and I don't get how they even made it into the game. Can someone tell me how the hell to add friends??",
        "Have always loved this game but even on my brand new Note 8 it has a hard time registering notes that are side by side at the same time. Even if I intentionally press harder and space my fingers better. It's random but will happen consitantly through a song if that makes sense."

        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics"

        "I love Snoopy! This is a great game. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star is because it runs slowly on my tablet. I do not have that many apps on my tablet that can inhibit the game's performance so not sure what the issue could be. Overall I do like this game!",
        "After I purchased coins on 3/22 and while  using them the game froze on me in the middle causing the coins to go to waste. I would like a refund please.",
        "I only tried it because I've always loved the Peanuts gang ! Although the games are maxed out with either match 3 or bubble popping, this one has proved that they aren't all alike ! Its cute and challenging. I've really enjoyed it so far !"

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "Really impressed with this Escape room! I've tried several others where I don't get anywhere, it makes it no fun to play! This one is just hard enough and some easy ones as well that it makes you use your brain & have fun at the same time!!! I'm basically a beginner and got stumped quite a few times, but eventually figured it out. This is the best escape room app I've played so far! Please make more!",
        "This really got me thinking, I loved the variety in the levels. The only issue is that some levels do have steps that are impossible to figure out as there's no connection in the clues. I had to use the videos more than I would've liked. The other issue is that you can't save progress so have to start a level from the beginning if you move away from the app.  Overall a really fun game that's had a lot of thought put into it.",
        "This game deserves my 5 stars!  and I'm no doctor but this is a perfect brain teaser to help your mind grow. It's addictive and for me no matter how hard a level got I NEVER wanted to delete this wonderful app. I now mastered all the levels and now it's time for me to delete it.",
        "Me and my two kids loved this game! It took us about a week to beat it but we were so proud of ourselves when we did. The help button was very useful for us in a couple levels that we just couldn't figure out. Fun game that really makes your brain work. Can't wait for new rooms!!",
        "Beat it within a day. You have to have good logic and reasoning skills. This is one of the top escape games going. It's not like others where random items open up doors making no sense. It's more tomb raider/resident evil type escape puzzles. Great game. Need alot more of this. Good job devs. Goooooood jooooooobbbbb!!!!"

The wins are far below expectations. in other words, the wins are way below the amount of coins spent. That's a turnoff for me. You wait so long for the bonus and get almost nothing in return. Can you please modify it so it pays a little better? All else great, the graphics, sounds and choices of slots.",

It is silly to invest an hour into exploring only to lose it all because of an extra click, especially when you have a bunch of telaports. When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",

        "It's great fun!! My only problem is when I watch first position in events those fast bikes look really fake. I hope it's just how it looks and it's not the actual game physics when I unlock those bikes. My biggest problem is tournaments. They have different categories for entry cost but the high speed players can still enter and win any tier tournament below Thier skill level. They should not be allowed to dominate lower tier players",
        "If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don't mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.",
        "Great game. Only criticism is, when your racing with other players where there are lifts etc. They can bypass the lift and go over water like it's just not there. And like others have said during tournaments the leader is like 10 seconds faster and supposedly on the same bike. There must be hackers there is no way at all the bikes fly or hover. Come on guys get a grip on this so it's fair for everyone",
        "I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It's miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi",
        "Bit hard to get used to at first. But when the bikes been upgraded and Machu Pichu opened game gets much more enjoyable and less frustrating. Smoth graphics with good gameplay. Any purchase gets rid of ads but at nearly £5 for cheapest purchase it's a bit steep (and you get very little for your £5). But, all in all, a very good game that's worth sticking with.",
        "Cherishable app! I love it, just some minor problems: - Has plenty ads and never skip once when quite competition.  - Its controls should be customizable.  - Partners' profiles should be viewable.      Thank you for your help!"

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

        "I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",
        "I love this app! It's sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it's a fantastic app!",
        "It's a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it's really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars",
        "It keeps crashing it doesn't help at all there are like 10 characters I'm a girl so I don't like pokemon I'm an 8 year old so I'd rather have older  girl characters and you can't choose the colors to draw with.There is nothing good about this don't download this if you are  older than 5 years and your a girl and your not babyish",
        "Well the animals are cute and the drawings are cute, but I thought you could use the rainbow color like in the picture,but you can't😢you should still get this app and definitely of you like drawing. It's still fun though!😆"

        "This game is really fun!! One bug I have found though is when you reset you're ascended points it gives you 20000 back no matter how many ascended points you have. For example I had 2 ascended points put them into damage reset it and got 20000 back. Gotta fix that. Over all it's a really fun game",
        "So far it's a very fun game. The music reminds me of old rpgs, and the random loot reminds me of Diablo. I'm about an hour into grinding and have only been forced to watch one 30 second ad but you have the option to watch a few more for items or perks. No bugs seen yet. I got a little happier when I left the game on and my lil hero's went into the dungeon without me.",
        "Can be very fun but is confusing at some points. For example, while attempting to ascend, you must lose the battle. Capturing beasts is also confusing and im still not sure what they are even used for. Otherwise, great game!",
        "This game gets very complicated very quickly. The game's mechanics of clicking on your character to heal them doesn't work often because the characters move quickly.  If you lock a specific item it still allows you to sell it with no notice. Overall a decent game that has too much to offer up too early.",
        "Auto play ads, and loading message on the screen at all times.  Power ups for sale at all timed.  These are the features that turned me completely away.  You should stay away too.",
        "They say it is fun playing this game, bit to me it's not. Why? The words are so very tiny cant read message written in it. If you let the letters enlarge it i'll give you 5 stars"

Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don't get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys' creativity.",

This game is addicting but it's hard to get past level 20 if you don't have Facebook. So I'm stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better",
        "Had to lower my stars. You have to use all the retry and balls a couple times just to figure out levels. Then u play 1 level and u wait for more energy. Same ole money app pay to play. Was ok until higher levels. Now it drives me crazy. Good game though just can't play it much.",
        "This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can't get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don't know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun",
        "Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That's truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that's ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I'm back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can't wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.",
        "Would be better if you could do everything without Facebook cos that sorta limits options for some people. Also could you please get rid of the energy bar? That makes things hard. But like that you put your actual voice in it."

I don't know what d problem is please tell me a solution",
        "It would be a really good game if it stops letting me use my coins then when I'm in the game for not even 5 seconds. It would shut down on me and when I login back in my coins are gone. I will like you to fix that",
        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",
        "Its good but the update mess me up because i have so many song that ived by but now i dont have any of it and there s a limit by purchasing a song 2 songs per day? And what happen to the connecting with fb? What the heck",
        "The new update STILL didn't fix the coin limit. And when I tried to buy something with my coins that I didn't have enough coin for it. I lost all my money and it told me I didn't have enough money to buy it! But it's still a good game. Also please put love ward in the game thanks",

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",

Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn't that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven't played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!",
        "It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don't have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I'll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.",
        "AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It's scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory's and watching theorists make more theory's. Amazing game and it's worth the money!",
        "Great! Even though this is only the demo, it is amazing. Just playing the demo made me nervous, but despite that I am purchasing the full game. (Luckily) I was able to complete the demo when I played it, so I am a valid advice giver to anyone who tries the demo. My advice: Get the demo. It is great. Another piece of advice is don't waste your battery. I was able to complete the demo with three bars of my battery left. The last piece of advice I'll give is to keep an eye on Bonnie.",
        "Force Close I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN ANY LIVING SOUL!! And then it doesn't work!? It's an awesome game and I would never hate, but is there any way that you can fix this? And I was also wondering if u can make the demo free for the first game out as well. Thanks Scott :)",
        "This game is scary for me because purple man jumpscares me a lot and am 9 years old. Scott thanks for making it but I will gave it 5 stars if you put a warning sign that says that there coming. Also if you could make the flashlight with more power and make it go to other nights and hard. But this game is scary and cool"

        "Great concept, design and execution. The game is simple to play but extremely hard to master, along the lines of Flappy Bird, and more closely, QWOP. The design language is innovative and intentionally sketch-like, but the physics of leg motion are hilariously realistic. There's no elaborate story (which makes this great for casual gameplay) but the motions, expressions, costumes and messages provide a compelling setting and get us to get quite fond of the clumsy main character.",
        "This game is so addicting! It is so fun and silly. The only thing I don't like is that every time I die, this thing pops up asking if I want to revive. It's kind of annoying. But overall, a great game!",
        "Simple game, does everything it sets out to do. Physics can be a bit weird at times, though. (Legs occasionally buckle for no apparent reason as if the ground has some sort of sliding factor.)",

        "The game is absolutely great but I wouldn't like to pay money just for a simple game like this to get ad free. Look the game is fun and addictive but it gets annoying with ads all the time but you can always just go on airplane mode?"

        "Perty good Edit: We're in the middle of an event and the game won't load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",

Furthermore, it seems the only people who play anymore are the weirdos who just write the word instead of draw so you can guess, which makes the whole game pointless. Like, the heck, dude? They want all the points and none of the fun. Ruins the entire app because that's all you ever get anymore.",
        "It is interesting and addictive game to play with friends. I would have given 5 for everything but for some bugs. One is it takes along time to load. Two there is a bug where even if the game loads we cannot see the drawing. Please fix them",
        "Too many ads! I liked this game years ago, forgot about it and recently downloaded again. I would of hoped that things would of improved but no. The annoying \"do you need a bomb\" keeps popping up non stop. Wish they would of added more brushes by now since it's a drawing app, it just makes drawing much harder since I use it on my mobile phone. A paint bucket would also be nice instead of coloring the whole page.",
        "Redownloaded this game after not playing for a while and it's pretty similar to before, but the amount of push notifications is making me uninstall again. I have notifications turned off in the app, yet I still get a push notification what seems like every hour. It's so unnecessary. So I am happily deleting this app again.",

        "This is the best of its kind for mobile, and one of the best overall. The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST. FU!CKING FIX THIS LOGIN ISSUE!!!!",
        "Well they still have to grow but I think it's op. As I play a lot of CS:Go (not sponsoring)  then I thought this could help me because my PC stopped working.. Anyways graphics aren't great but good.. They aren't clean. Oh and last before I end this comment- when you complete offer for credits it doesn't give you the credits.. That's sad..  So yeah.. Just keep it up!! 👍👍"

        "Microtransactions riddled garbage. Fun game but you need to play some levels like 100 times or buy stuff. i was about to play some games but after this I don't want to play anymore. Gaming on mobile is joke",
        "Fabulous game! I absolutely flew past all the episodes and the online save feature works fantastically well. I successfully recovered gameplay from about 6 months ago. I got back my progress and all my gold. One of the best games out there :)",
        "Definitely a relieving break from the onslaught of talking Tom spin offs.. This game here is the most redneck tower defense kind of game you could get, and I love that. It's a standard shooting tower defense game, but with variety in enemies and even multiplayer! Who woulda thought?",
        "IT can be scary because it fell like you go lose but then it fell. Better because you won i JUST GOT THIS GAME 🎮  2min ago and am on leavel 5 GANG GANG AM A GIRL",
        "Fun best game, easy to play and all i can say is fun as hell. I guess i could be more fun if you add some gore effect or blood splat. Super fun if you can see the bullets hit them.",
        "I've loved this game for such a longtime!!  I always make sure I download game whenever I upgrade to a new phone...it doesn't bother me to start all over bcuz I could play this game from beginning to end everyday!!  Game actually allows u to start where u left off but many times I choose to start from beginning..i wonder if there's ever going to be a sequel to swamp attack...swamp attack 2, swamps revenge??  Lol...i HOPE SO!!!"

        "Sadly I have decided today to uninstall this game. I've been really enjoying it but it is simply too resource hogging for me and keeps crashing. I think it needs an option to turn off animations especially when building etc.  EDIT. Since getting a newer, faster Samsung tablet the game has improved for me immeasurably. Excellent!",
        "Amazing game! Very similar to the original RC Tycoon, but a few added changes to make it more interesting. I've only encountered one major glitch where my park was erased and instead was given a friend's (I still had all coins, tickets, cards) but I had to rebuy whatever rides and buildings I had that my friends park didn't BUT they reimbursed me for it and gave me enough coins to rebuild my park (probably twice over thh). So overall a great game and great customer assistance too!",
        "Usually ill make it to level 10 in other games like, but this has been the only one that can hold my attention for so long. Just hit level 40 a figured it deserved a review! 5 stars from me! I love that you dont have to wait for anything. The missions just keep popping up regardless of how many you finish. If I didn't have any responsibilities I could literally play all day long.",
        "My very first tychoon game and I love it. Very addicting! Can't stop playing. Such fun building your own amusement park. Could have a tutorial you can click on whenever you need to know how to play but, other than that, really good game."

Different features to the game, but that, too, is to be expected. You can choose to watch ads to aid your progress, but they are not intrusive, which I appreciate greatly. The game really isn't challenging in the beginning, but I haven't gotten far. This is totally worth the download. Great, great job devs, thanks for all the hard work!!!!",

I do wish there was more information available on how to increase the happiness of your followers... as it seems that no matter how much you build and gift and inspire they are always behind the Astari! A little work in developing a help section would go a long way! And some more diverse purchase packages would make it more appealing to pay!",
        "This is the best game I've downloaded from the playstore, ever. It doesn't bombard you with ads and you get sooo much content! You even have the option to watch an unlimited number of ads for free gems if you so choose, and gem costs for items are totally reasonable. The story is cute and interesting and the graphics are pleasing. The controls are also very user friendly. It's been like three weeks and I'm still addicted. Superb work guys!!",
        "This game is mesmerising. The graphics seem simple, but they are so elegant and beautiful. The background music is good too. Edit: I got addicted to the game, and that cause its a game that absorbs you in. I had previously rated it 5 stars but now, the game won't open at all. It stops working every time, is all my progress lost now?",
        "Was looking for a settlers type game when I found this.I love it. It is a calm and addictive game. Love the story boxes ,I can't wait to complete the story, (I bet mrcreepypasta on YouTube would knock a narration out the park). Really enjoy the landscaping element, just waiting on the seabed ability now. Only bugbear I have is stickers seem to be very difficult to obtain. It seems boxes are few and far between once grey cleared areas have been checked.",
        "Seems like it could be a cool game. Didn't mind the ads until they started just playing the sound on a black screen. Timer runs out and no x to continue. I restart the app but I have to get past an ad to open a pretty important menu. (Galaxy note 8)"

The gameplay and controls are ok besides the repetitive fights. The boss battles are incredible at best. If I would rate it from a 1-10, I would give it an 8.

        "This is an idle game with effort and pretty fun writing, with a lot of ways to feel rewarded without cracking your wallet. It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "The fast pace of the game keeps you hooked.  They don't throw ads at you but certainly make them available for great benefits.  It's not clunky at all which makes it easy to pick up and play a couple minutes here and there.  It's a ridiculous concept of making money off taxis/fares, heck I'd move to the cab driver profession if I made &gt;$500 million on one fare... but funny and fun nonetheless.",
        "I really like this game a lot. I'm not usually into these idle games, but from all the ones ive tried. Ive enjoyed this one the most. Other then the occasional slow down, it mostly runs great. And the model for ads is very very fair. If you decide to watch and ad, you always get some kind of reward out of it. But its completely optional.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Huge battery drain compared to any other game i have played including the new tekken and sims mobile games which are much more graphical. Will sometimes lose game progress when you completely close the app (so not running in background). Taxi's occasionally get stuck on buildings or vanish off screen completely. If it wasn't for these issues it could be a much better game.",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like."

        "Oh boy this way funny! I think my ears are going to burst! XD Anyone who gets it, try playing a song backward or in overlord. IT IS HILARIOUS!!!   You did a great job on the effects, and even when i had the ghost playing the brightest song it sounded creepy. The dragon also made me want to hide as it sounded like it was stomping around as the music blasted through my ears.  Overall, great app. I might be using it on halloween... XD",
        "The app works wonders! The cathedral effect is my favorite (it also makes your voice sound a thousand times better, lol). There are some effects I'm not a big fan of, though, and I think they're not that interesting, such as Poltergeist, Android, Cyborg or Devil. Still, this is the best app for voice effects!",
        "This is the best app! You don't need to talk or to record your own voice in order for this app to change your voice. All you have to do is to type what you want to say and.... That's all! You git my 5 Star, greetings from Philippines",
        "This app is surprisingly a pretty efficient and versatile little gizmo! It has actually quality effects and is super easy to use. I find myself downloading it again and again whenever I need sound stuff, because I keep getting roped into bigger fancier apps that get too complicated and expensive.",
        "I like how you change your voice and record anything like barks, nerf guns, singing and growls. It might be cool if you added a GROWN-UP voice effect you know for kids, plus people who are already grown up could see what they'd sound like double grown-up! PS: Your video \"IS very funny\" No, it wasn't funny, IT WAS HILARIOUS! :D",
        "Nice effects, but Death, Dragon, Evil Puppet etc. All sound very familiar. I think the Death one should have a much more echoey scratchy voice, Dragon should be super loud, superior, scratchy. Same with the fly, shrinking, and small person etc. They all have super squeaky voices  Make them differ And maybe add a girl voice and a man voice so you can just be plain man or plain girl :p Its very good and I like how you can record it, so I can now troll people with the zombie voice."

        "Like the game BUT WAY TO MAMY ADS. No game needs this many ads, I can't do anything without an ad popping up. It is really getting on my last nerves, ecut down the amount I don't mind a few but not that many.",
        "The amount of ads is ridiculous! Especially from that \"Tune Blast\", it's really annoying. And, w/some of the ads you have to wait 30sec before they're done, there's no \"x\" button. The actual mahjong game itself is decent.",
        "Overall, I love the game. The only thing wrong is that there's too many ads! I can't even go from menu to menu without an ad popping up. It's very irritating.",
        "I think there is a pretty critical error about the card arrange. I have just played today's game (12/2) and found it impossible to complete it. There were only one pair of cards with two dots and they overlapped each other, which of course I could not pair them up. And there were three pairs of one strip appeared.",
        "It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down."

        "Great game but on small problem. I can usually get the easy ones done in 10-17 minutes, until I get to an A. Ries \"easy\" puzzle. When I do those it turns into 45-50 minutes. I can do the medium puzzles in just under that time.  I think they are misclassified and should be look at. Other than that they controls are great and provides good entertainment! Ty.",
        "Never mind.  Took me awhile but I finally figured out the system.  Maybe I'm just not seeing it but when I come back to playing I can't tell which puzzles or packs I've completed.  Could we have a check mark or change of colour or counter bar to indicate which packs or puzzles have been completed?  Easy controls and easy to see size for my tablet.  There are some ads if not purchased but they don't pop up unexpectedly and are quickly closed after just a few seconds.  I wish other dev's would take note of this.  Since I will only be using easy to medium puzzles I probably will not pay nearly $7.00 but if it ever goes on a 50% off sale I just might buy.  THANK you for your reply.",
        "This is a really good crossword puzzle app. I'm not too keen on the ads. It is obviously American so us Brits do have to really think on some of your more homegrown clues. All in all I am thoroughly enjoying it as it keeps the little grey cells working.",
        "Great game. Good mix of easy - challenging puzzles. Only complaint is that when the app is open, even in the background, it will cause my spotify app to pause music every couple minutes, so I am unable to listen to music while playing which can be frustrating. But that being said, I still thoroughly enjoy this app!",
        "The game is well made. The content is often lacking. There should be report features for crosswords that are incorrect. Larry H has several mispellings in his crosswords, making them nearly impossible. \"Aron\" and \"Navaho\" are so blatantly wrong, I wish he couldn't submit his crosswords anymore",
        "Excellent puzzles! Sometimes a bit USA orientated (sports & politics) but general knowledge is universal. The hard level is really hard, easy makes you think hard too sometimes. Does not use up data in the background. Recommended."

        "It's an OK game the reason I gave it 3 stars was it gets a little boring after a while and the controls are kind of hard to use but if u like these types of games then u should absolutely try it",
        "Ii really like the graphics te music and yeah the game is really interesting and fun don't listen to bad reviews some people just want to tarnish their reputation and some maybe there is a problem with the game on their phone",
        "The reasons rated this all the way is because that you get more options of hair color and it's no copy game like the others were it tells you what to do so yeah",

The card backs and faces are cool, I just wish that shuffling through the cards and reshuffling was a little faster. Overall, I love solitaire and play it A LOT, so this game is okay by me.",

You're locked into the game end screen and are left to tap the recent apps button then kill the game using the \"X\" else tap the \"Home\" button, which leaves the game running in the background. Clearly the developers don't know Android as well as iOS, which doesn't give the option of exiting gracefully like Android...",
        "Only thing I'd like to see changed is to have the option to skip all the whooptedoo after winning a game. First couple times, it's cute, but by the dozenth time it gets tedious. Apart from that, I'm a happy player. (EDIT, a couple months later...) Another real nuisance is the continual request for a 5-star rating even after I'd given one. As a consequence, I've lowered my rating. Still worth playing, but there's serious nuisance value.",

Been playing for awhile now and not once did I hit the Wheel of Riches or What's in the box. It's bit deceiving that you have to increase your bet to activate the Wheel of Riches or What's in the Box when it rarely or never hits. At least allow those to hit once every thousand spins or something.",

        "My mom loved you so much. She passed away Dec. 18th. She would've loved this game you have. I play in honor of her memory and well, i love you to. Been a fan since before your johnny carson appearance. Wish i could go to your show and play a game for the fun of it and to meet you. Sincerely, Tim Simpson",
        "Ellen, love the candles that light up to spell your name. Clever. The reels in your games are Hurkey jerkey. Smooth is better. Solo, where is the box in What's in the Box? Where is the reel in wheel to riches? Your pay outs are much better on max bet. Took me a while to get to 100M. Keep up the creative good work.",
        "I keep watching the ads to get extra coins and none of them get awarded. I never get the wheel of riches or multijackpots or what's in the box no matter how high I play. I've played SO MANY times on the #Imatellen one and the heart emoji is as big as it gets but I've never gotten the bonus game. These glitches are ridiculously frustrating. Honestly if they don't get fixed soon I'm just gonna delete and find a different casino app.",
        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !"

        "READ THIS NOW!!!!! i love it it is very addictive a great time killer and once you start playing it you can't stop unless your battery is dead.how you play it  js t hat you make videos and then by tapping ijt you earn money an d when you have enough 🤑$$$ you can buy a pug and then he has a store and you buy stuff for it. You also can put stuff in your backk yard. And you c an change the way you look. And the best part i s you can buy really cool stuff with the diamonds and you can earn more subscribers. Thank you for reading this it took me 2 min.to type it",
        "This game is so edicting. I only just got it and ime loving it. I allredy have a rell chanel but this game makes making a vidio simple and fun. All you have to do is tap pres publish and boom you get nice coments good vuis and nice suggestions. Man oh man am i adictid to this game. Good adictid it really really is such a good game. That my freind is why i gave it 5 stars and recomend it to evry one. It is just as good if not better than peudiepies tuber simulator. So pleas get this one",
        "I get that free games have ads. That's fine. But you can't get 20 taps in or switch to a new tab before you get another 30/50 second ad. I thought this was just a fluke, but it keeps happening every 30 seconds like it's on a timer. This game would be fantastic other wise. Uninstalled it after the first half hour.",
        "I found that this game is so addicting till you got like 100000 views ever second... then it becomes very boring... but I do recommend it to people who want a game to play for like 2 weeks but don't expect any big reward for play long... I just want tapps to make something rewarding to getting higher like designing your gaming setup or actual able to make a video and upload it to the game... overall good game",
        "Surpisingly fun.    I'm not a big fan of clicker games, but this is defiantly worth it. The game is not overwhelmed with adds, and you get to customize your character. However, when you reach a certain point in the game, Its not fun anymore. Tiers just take time because of the progress gap, and there is basically nothing to do. If they added more stuff after you reach the top, I would rate 5 stars. Can you please add a update to fix this issue?",
        "Surprisingly fun. I'm iffy on idle clicker games but the reviews convinced me; there's lots of unique aspects to this game that other clicker games don't have. It's competitive, which is cool, and you can actually customize the upgrades. The main thing that makes me stay away from idle clickers is that there's no customization. In this game you can customize your room and yard, character, and even choose the videos you post. Lots of fun stuff to do, definitely worth a try."

        "Below is my earlier review. As of today, 1st December 2017, I'm on level 3410 and the game is not moving forward to the next level. What's happening?   This is the only logical, fun and satisfying bursting games I've played till now!   Just one suggestion, you should give more ammunition for the black balloons rounds.   Great game! 👍",
        "I was looking for a simple game to kill a little time and that didn't require too much concentration. This fit the bill perfectly. I didn't care about point scores but if you do you might find this a bit frustrating because the point scoring is pretty ambiguous. Otherwise this is a simple but fairly entertaining diversion that can be played for a long or short session while you're trying to fill some spare time.",
        "I would love this game! I even reached level 3410! But it doesn't let me progress from there. I am stuck after completing 3410. There's some glitch. Please fix this!!!",
        "Cant get games 162 and 163 they are not there and find it keeps freezing.. very frustrating",
        "It's the best. While I am babysitting  my young grandchild(1Yr)old  he can help me play too. It is the best game ever even  my husband wanted to  install it.",
        "I've downloaded this game several times and when I get over level 100 the game doesn't load the next level. I wish they would fix this gliche."

        "Simple game that had the potential to be fun but the fact that you can't dodge the spears is stupid takes a lot of the fun out of the game.  Bug: Any score above 19 doesn't get registered for some reason. I got a highscore of 19 and after that even if I get 22-25 kills, the new highscore is never saved. I think the app is not counting the added points for headshots.",
        "Great game, but what's next? Have the Spear of Infinity (cool) and have reached 420 kills. What about an exploding spear (BOOOM) that clears the entire field. Especially those fireball buggers. More aggressive opponents too would be nice :-)  Thanks for a fun game to pass the time with. Cheers!",
        "Great game. Too many ads EVEN AFTER YOU PURCHASE THE ADD FREE UPGRADE. Point scoring makes no sense. Upgrades are practically useless. A few tweaks would make this game a classic. Unfortunate that the developers have chosen to be greedy and lazy.",
        "Absolutely love it, two suggestions though to perfect it. A sensitivity adjuster for finer aiming would be cool, but most importantly, could we please have an option to select a single background colour. It's jarring having the background changing all the time. Great work though!",
        "I really do enjoy this game. but it had suggested I download another of one your games called \"vikings\" in exchange for 900coins. afterwards there were none awarded or no indication of how I would recieve them. I hate stupid ploys like this or even miss direction whatever it may have been. I'm actually considering deleting the app because of it.",
        "I unlocked one of the special abilities and it is hard to use in gameplay.  I would be in a game and as an enemy shot an arrow at me I tried to click the small button on the bottom right corner but I wasn't able to because it was too small.  I would suggest that you make the button bigger for convenients. Thank you."

Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards. You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",

Ask anyone in bf 62",

        "Cost of everything in the game is particularly high. And gems??? Don't even get me started.  They just dropped some limited time dragons in the game, and the cost of EACH them is OVER $100 if you haven't been able to earn that many gems in game yet.  Which takes a very, very long time.  Uninstalling today, casual players beware.",
        "Very relaxing game. I wouldn't say it's a \"time killer\" because after playing for hours you'd probably spend a lot of cash out of your pocket, if you don't want to pay this game calls for lots of patience. If you have PATIENCE you will NOT have to buy anything. I've been playing for almost 2 years now and I have only spent 30$ on the game and not because I felt like i had to but because I just wanted to; to speed the game play up a bit. I have gotten every dragon so far, even the event dragons, and limited time dragons, etc. Without  having to spend any gems. Sometimes it takes days of breeding the same pair but it will work if your persistent and patient! :)",
        "Concept-wise the same as with many breeding games. It's fun, a nice game to have for here and there.  Generally good ideas were implemented into this game. Most dragon designs are really good. Unfortunately I don't understand some of the mechanics in the game like removing something from the market makes you lose this item? I mean the last time I have opened a market on the street, I kept my things I put for sale. :? Please fix those logic flaws.",
        "It's fun enough if you don't take it too serious. I could write a long review but I was in the middle of playing when the game kept asking for a review, kind of annoying. But in all honesty this is one of two games I have consistently played for a long time now, so I really do like it.",
        "I really love this game...i have this one and the other DragonVale. I have alot of fun with my grandkids breeding the different dragons. I will say tho that I would have given this 5 stars all the way across if it didn't take so long to get some of the dragons. We have been trying for the Knarr dragon for months and can not get it. It is very frustrating. If it wasn't for the new events that give us a chance to breed new dragons I am afraid I would have uninstalled this due to it taking wayyyyyyy to long to breed certain dragons.",
        "I've been playing this game for a LONG time. And it continues to keep my interest! It's so fun! And with the constant release of new dragons and events, it stays fun. I wish there were more events, but Hey! It's a great game! Expand that market place though..."

On tablet i am loged in with a google paly account, when i login to same account on my phone it doesnt ask me to download other chapters and i dont have any items or achivements. Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",
        "Not the master. But I had got with the achievement \"thaught the teacher\". After defeating hermit now I am used to magic. Only in few minutes I can earn money and upgrade\u200b my gear. Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "I have been playing this game for over 3years now and I know how far I have gone with the game... Just lost my phone and I got a new one and... Google Play can't restore Me to my previous level.. Please fix because I can't just start playing the game over from the beginning.. Thanks"
