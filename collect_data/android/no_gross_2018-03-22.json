        "My first played MOBA. This is excellent game and there's nothing could beat this game. Otherwise, please make improvement like losing stars cause of that AFK player. Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

        "I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I have to say, I didn't have high hopes when I started. 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop and I wanted to play more. It's a different take on a Final Fantasy game, and it really does feel like a Dissidia game in RPG form. The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

        "This WAS my favorite game and was happy to spend a small amount of money to make my team competitive. If you are a new player DON'T download this game unless you plan to spend thousands of real money you are too far behind to compete. It now takes about 15 million in game currency to max out a character with all it needs. you will only make about 8 million a week if you complete every task and join a good team. So basically 2 weeks per character and you need a minimum of 5 maxed characters to make a dent",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "From the most review, maybe Playstore should add rank and trophy for the most worst games update. And the MMORPG is a Role Playing Games, and the role for us is simple in this game, it is a same role as others, rank up your power, thats all. How can such game be called MMORPG? I suggest there is new class for this kind of games MMOPOG (Masive Multiplayer Online Power Oriented Games) + AEP behind it, A.K.A Auto and Easy to Play. Hail power which is as easy as to pay 😁.",
        "The good. - Visual : one of the best visual in mobile game in my opinion - graphic setting : the graphic setting are good, just like a pc game where there is a lot of graphic option player can choose to get optimum performance.   The bad  - Auto questing : seriously why bother to play if it use auto, it's much better if you guys upload it on youtube as a video series.  - story : not really interesting. - character creation is just too limited.",
        "Well... It's a good game. Better than the others... Tapi sayangnya pay2win aja sih.. Gw suka dungeon grindingnya.. Kalo bisa tambahin Special equipment yang gabisa di beli pake duit tapi di dapetin dari lawan boss , dungeon , clan war dll pokonya hasil dari loot. Tambahin juga sistem trade antar player dong pake red diamond / adena biar economy sistemnya seru.. Biar chat ga sepi.",
        "Why can't I purchase at the bundle shop using prepaid load? I want to but that red armor selection box so badly. Please help it always says transaction failed. My Wi-Fi is stable no problem with my connection. Please fix. I'll give you higher rating when you fixed it. Anyways it's a great RPG, it's well balanced and easy to play. Continue improving.",
        "Graphics is 5/5. Gameplay is 4/5. Control is 4/5. Given that this game's graphics is excellent, ithink the developers need to work more on making variations and unique customizations towards the characters. Now that there is a 3rd class, there is still no difference between the appearances of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd class. Unless you cast a skill, that's the only time you you'll know that character's class. I think this is what Netmarble must develop further. It is already given that most games nowadays are pay-to-win or pay-to-grow. So, making the use of excellent graphics by various character customization and great gameplay is to be expected.",
        "Graphic 5/5 Very nice for a mobile game.  Gameplay 2/5 Lack of depth in character customization. No stats or skills to change and can't change gender and looks that much in character creation.  Control 3/5 Nice but it would be better if we could aim which target we are going to attack with basic attack and skills. Like if we press the button there's some sort of wheel to control which direction we're going to attack.  Overall nice game but definitely can be improved."

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

The minus is city is to small for lot of player like that. Very crowd, i cant even see other player appereances. So camera angle maybe you can make lil bit wider or higher so city can looked much bigger",

I only can report the first transaction because the app is not allowed me to report again before the first one is solved. I topped up for event but the event will  end today. If this is solved after goddess kiss event, I just want my money back. I wont delete this until the problem is solved fairly.",

It brought me back to the main menu n tht i hav to log in again BUT i cant log in. I even uninstalled and installed it back a couple of times. It feels like im just taking chances here to be able to play. This all started in the afternoon for me. Not sure bout the rest. But please take some action about this matter and/or respond to us regarding this matter, Thru facebook or here. I really like the game. Soo please. Help. Explain whats happening. Get it fixed quickly.",

        "Awesome It's very addictive! The graphics are nice too but I was disappointed with the heroes - there are only three to choose from. And, you cannot change your avatar for easier recognition. The current thing is okay but sometimes it's difficult to know who is who unless you really pay attention to the name of a player.  Overall, it's awesome and highly recommended :)",
        "Had so much fun and thrill in playing the game. Graphics and overall performance is great!! Though i would just like to be helped with my old account.PLEASE HELP ME RETRIEVE MY OLD ACCOUNT :( I want to continue my old progress but since ive changed phone, Id have to redownload and log in in the game. Tho unfortunately you guys updated it from the last time I played it and now, When i log in using my supposed account it kept me getting right from the start in choosing character. How can i get my old character back? Thats so unfair :( I made all effort :( My username is PetLucifer. Also, does server has to do anything in relation to that? Cause i cant remember which server i used to log in"

I emailed support and they told me what server my character should be on and she's still not there! It keeps prompting me to make a new character.",

Other people in game said they had the same problem and said to fix it, you needed to uninstall it and redownload. Which I did. But now my characters are gone and I have to start off fresh. I've spent money in the game on  building up two characters. And I'm pissed now that it appears its money totally wasted. I feel that this is basically stealing!!",

It keeps restarting and resetting to 0%",

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

        "So much development has went into this game, the reason why I like it is because of the consistent updates and new stuff. It's hard to find games now with nothing new to bring to the table. It makes you want to invest into this game. Not to mention how generous they can be with the free gifts and whatnot. Keep it up Netmarble!",
        "NM is slowly setting up higher prices for uniform qualities that should be 750 when on sale.. Now all new uniforms are 1050 when on sale even if the bonus and changes are trash. I'm disappointed that this game is changing drastically to a greedy game. Soon i will uninstall this game if this will continue.",
        "This game is awesome. Love playing it everyday and everytime. But  recently I have a problem with the game crashing almost all the time. Please help me fix this problem.  I also want to ask when will you give Odin a uniform? A better skillset, a heal, and a piercing ability for him to shine again as a god. Looking forward to it Netmarble.",
        "There are some incredibly predatory practices with the in app purchases.  For example, if you buy the new Emma Frost pack, you won't get her work fully leveled gear, and that isn't made clear on the purchase screen.  You will need to buy the package at least once, and possible multiple times over to actually advance her.",
        "This game was good. The past 6 months have just been a display of how game companies do not care for user experience but rather their pockets. Cash grab all the way. This game had potential to be the greatest, but a pure let down for the entire community.",
        "Game is easily a 4/5 stars, it's fun, addictive, and fair. It has had it wobbles but for new players, there is enough to do to keep you interested without needing to pay cash."

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring.",
        "After playing this game it's extremely pay to play. You never get notified if you get placed in a higher tier. There is very low rewards which makes upgrading your weapons and armor a grind unless you purchase them. Whenever you get a duplicate insignia you're supposed to get gold but you never see it. Because of these things I'm uninstalling the game. It's garbage. Good job devs!"

        "Not like the online version at all. Graphics are below par. Can't access everything such as miracles on the mobile app. Can't sign treaties or find alliances. For it being 2018, you would think the app could do everything the online version does. Disappointing in every aspect. Pull it together, creators! Make something that is useful in this age, not from a decade ago.",
        "Its the worest app ever so far. Lacking so much things that playing the game on the app causes you to lose stuff and bothers you. The funny thing is thay their site always tells you to download the app. Seriously start thinking with logic. If the app lacks so much, then stop insisting on showing that app downloading window on the site.",
        "Cant even log in to my account. Works just fine on pc, but the app is straight up garbage. Username recovery doesnt work either. Practically nothing works and i havent even logged in yet. Insane.",
        "When I started playing I did not provide my email. Now that I want to provide, I cannot.  I go to the lobby. Click on Extra information. Enter my email and new password  and press enter details. Nothing happens then  Something worth looking into",
        "Too terrible compared to the pc version. The design team of this app should retake the course of basic game designing.",
        "The game is best on pc but worst on the app. Looks like the app developer missed so many things. It gets stuck on loading status on many areas (Pillage, Transport goods, etc) and it lacks many features that are already available in pc. So technically, you still need to log in to browser version in order to fully enjoy the game. On this age, some of us no longer use browsers and expect just the app to give all things needed. I considered buying some ambrosia but seeing a lot of problems makes me think otherwise. I hope the developers spend some time in actually developing the app. The game itself has a lot of potential."

        "Overall this game is really fun.. just that I'm from SG and my friend from TH we were planning to play together but we realise it's both different server we can't play together.. Is there anyway for you AOV team to make a server for all SouthEastAsia so many will all be happy... sorry for any inconvenience caused.. appreciate for you team to try your best. Without you guys we work get to experience such good gameplay. Thank you 🤗😘",
        "This game is awesome! And more importantly, it's waaaay better than the cancer graphics of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. This game needs strategy and teamwork, unlike MLBB, it's a very easy game that doesn't require brains. MLBB has a lot of cancer players, trashtalkers, and stupid players. Although, you can never remove those kind of players but at least they stay in MLBB, and smarter people plays this. This is the best MOBA on smartphones! Kudos!",
        "I seriously love this game and got me hooked to MOBA games. One quirk though, I got the skin for Astrid which looks like Arthuria from Fate Stay Night. One suggestion is to make her sword glow gold instead of red to make it match more to Arthuria (Saber). Thanks! Keep up the good work!",
        "So I played to get the heroes for free on road to glory. but then there was this one hero i liked. maloch. it says i have already gotten it. but i can't use it since i havent acquired the hero. and i cant buy it. so kept playing to get the next hero and still the same problem. its like its giving me false hope or assumption that i could get those heroes. but no guess i was wrong. or it is a bug. fix this asap",
        "I'm done. At least balance the matchmaking system and determine a players skill level. I was on Gold 3 then back to Silver 1 again? Wow Tencent. Good job making an enjoyable game, but this won't make me say that this MOBA is fine for me. Fix the issues first.",
        "update I wonder why game app like R.O.S and this moba AOV need a huge update. Please make this game using abit amount of size from before & please make game more balance. Player with low connection please dont make them didn't join any rank match or what.. they always make our game really bad"

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though.",
        "I am currently on vacation and this app has given me more points of interest than using Google Maps alone!!  Every single pokestop is something interesting...  I don't know why I didn't think to use it for this sooner.  I've seen more in this city today than I have the 3 days I've been here!"

The graphics are  really bad on mobile and you can't higher the graphics which is boring, but I still love this game its really fun.",
        "Garbage ot gives ur computer viruses. And games are limited on the phone or tablet people with out robux can't play bloxbrug so its not a goof game and people should be able to customize the character with out buying robux its just dumb",
        "This game is AMAZING!!! Just fix a few glitches though. I play this game 24/7. I even get my tablet at bedtime and play on it. 1 last thing. Why did your moderators not get our reports and why can't we say simple words when we chat?",
        "It's a really great game but there are some flaws to it. First of the game is reall laggy for me and tends to always disconnect me in a game and I fell as if the reporting thing doesnt work either because they are never really blpcled for a while but those are tge only things but overall its an amazing game",
        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",

You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",
        "I love this game! I play at every opportunity I get. Thanks for helping me set up the game on my tablet. I have however, run into another issue I hope you can help me resolve. I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

        "The graphics are cool, the gameplay is all fun and games, no stupid  energy system allows me to play freely as I want to. This is one of the best games that I have ever played and I love Sword Art Online. However, the only downfall is the scout rates for both characters and weapons. Allow me to give this suggestions instead. At least 11x scout give one guaranteed R4 characters/weapons. Other famous games do it, believe me. This will fix all those comments about scout rates.  Added : the game is still as good as it was when there is no R5 chara. Seems you guys haven't take my advice.",
        "This should be played in panoramic mode rather than portrait with a virtual controller instead like most, if not all other rpg type games on mobile devices. This game is a bit of a mess with its bugs and layout. Character and weapon scouting is rigged as you will mainly get weapons that your characters cannot equip or vise versa. Half of my 20 characters are sword wielders with no one above 4 stars, and I have only 2 weapons that are swords! This game needs to have better consistency with it's character to weapon generation.",
        "Nice game for mobile sao... no energy bar witch mean no limit to play time and anytime... easy to understand system and good graphic... just need to improve the heat problem little better next time coz either use wifi or data the heat from playing this game is to hot... others... it superb game for sao fan",
        "I played it multiple times. I did around ten 11x pulls, and never even got a 4 star character. Truly an appauling display of a gameplay experience for a great anime. I recommend not playing if you expect to get through the game with a decent character.",
        "Controls is trash, potrait mode screen hinders sight, and the warnings for boss atk all look the same. Cant see if i can parry or i must dodge. The jump is screwing with my ability to move, and the bosses aoes r so big and unblockable i might as well forget getting close to it. Rng for scouts is so bad i want to quit the game. Im stuck unless i pay money but it doesnt come with a garantee ill get a 5*. Fun to start playing for a few days but hard to keep playing the game.",
        "I dont have a problem with \"Scout\" since i got both GGO chars and guns.  Yesterday I can play it. But now I cant play.. after title screen it send error message. I tried my net in FPS game and theres no lag. Pls help. Also pls remove the character requirements in the quest. Like Leafa.. I dont have her since I only Scout twice 😂 I think its better if you just add jump button than swipe to jump cuz sometimes instead of dodging the enemy it just jump and receive tons of damage or even die. Btw. Main quest is easy but event quest is challenging and I enjoy it..  (This is the first time I write a long review) sorry if my english is bad. Thank for this game. I really enjoy it."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

        "Awesome game! It is user friendly even on f2p players. May I just suggest one thing? I think it would be fun if you could get on and off your mount anywhere. Be it on the town or at the battle field. But so that it wont be used as a means of scape, it should have a casting time to ride the mount. Over all it is the best game there is. Love it to the moon and back! =)",
        "This game is awesome actually but the developer keep opening new servers instead of merge the server. So many people choose to stop to play Seal because of this since less people play in most server. So please don't waste your money and time to play it. You cannot transfer your character to other servers. You need to start from begining. This make the overall experience becoming so bad.",
        "Good game overal. But.. Admin.. Can u please explain to me.. How to use old account when i use other phone? Coz its keep make me new character. Cant use the main. I log in using samsung play. Or can i bind with other account? Pls help me. Coz i change use 2 phones.. And the other one always run off battery. Thanks",
        "I love this game, it's so addicting. But I only gave it 4 stars because we have too many servers. I highly suggest to not add many servers and just fix the older ones because the players in older servers are getting fewer. Like, I'm in S105, and it's not been a week but there's already another server? And it's draining players. Please stop adding servers so some servers will have players too.",
        "I really loved this game. Its content its gameplay indeed it is really my taste. However, i hope that we can transfer into other servers without restarting ones account. As well as the timing system of each events sometimes its not exact. Hope you guys work on it to make this GAME BETTER. Pleaseeeeeeeeee!!!!!!",
        "I was seal(pc) player long time ago, after go to college had to stop to play games on pc(need it for my degree) until i hear that seal on my region is closing, played for 5 years,vacum for roughly 3 years then closing. I just swipe left, right, searching for new game to play, then i found this one, indeed its good, but not even close to the seal pc. That being said, the game itself is ok, it like other game that already around, hack n slash, vip, etc. But i can't feel im playing seal on this game. It feel like playing common game. I can't express it properly, but ... Yeah, uninst, i don't want to ruin my memories bout seal."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Would be better if the game wasn't playing by itself, I mean come on maybe most mmo have auto run auto battles but tht just ruined the point of gaming!. Why not just give the players a mini map or something to navigate and let them find their way through the game. Its not a bad game but this is not a game at all with all these auto battles n stuff in here. I know u can disable it but still yall know wht I mean.",
        "Love it! Sure, it has auto battle and auto guide for missions, but it can be turned off if you are really picky about that. It has much more choices in class, and highly customizable.   There is a bunch of other awesome features that you don't even need to spend money on, so I myself would recommend this game to those who like this sort of thing!   Thanks developers, you're awesome!",
        "Servers seem to be stabilizing so I'm going to change my 1 star review to 3. This game would have been great if they used the same graphics as the story. In this day and age developers have made huge leaps forward in the department and this game doesn't show it. Its jam packed with things to do, customization and other things. If they update the graphics this game would be the masterpiece that it needs to be!",
        "Doesn't seem to work on my mobile data? I don't have high-speed, but other MMORPGs work perfectly fine on average speed. I get the error message \"Server Connection Lost (0)-1\" or something every time I load it, and have yet to get farther than the loading screen (where the current event pop-up comes on, after the download loading screen.) I was really looking forward to playing. If I can get the app to work (going to try online tomorrow!), I'll happily change my review! I'd really like this to work on my data, though; I don't have wifi at home.",
        "Fantastic game it takes some time to get used to the camera angles (It would be even better if you could rotate the camera around your character, it improves the atmosphere). Combat is ... Well it takes time to get used to that too that could use some improvements. Character design is good I like it Story is good also (Still progressing). Overall great game few small updates and changes will make it a even better game.",
        "Just as a personal opinion, a 60 fps option would be a good  initial long term patch to be working on. Also you need to realize the fan base your working with, I haven't played the pc version but it looks like some of your fans transitioning from pc top mobile aren't very happy.  Also the mobile rpg type game fans are pretty hard to please initially, we've probably been through tons of other games with the same approach as you. Other than that I would think about how to polish the game up a bit more, maybe look at other games and see what elements make them look polished verses your own game?"

        "I love everything about it!!! It's been a long time since I've played RPG other than my PSP which was almost more than 5 years back. I missed playing games like this so much and I must say this game brings back memories when I played Naruto crazily. Brings the crazy inner gamer out! So yes! I love this game! Thank you♡ And everything is perfect too!",
        "It has: 1.Waifus 2.Badass combat 3.BEWBS 4.Cool gears 5.Cute beautiful graphics 6.Fun, REALLY FUN gameplay 10/10 will keep playing. One problem that have occured for some time, there's no more english subtitles. I don't know what will be the reason for that, but please bring it back. The cutscenes are not useful if you can't understand it.",
        "Its got amazing graphics and great gameplay..but when i close the game for a short time and reload it..the screen always goes black and nothing loads. Ive already tried force stop and unstalling and reinstalling it and 80% of the time its a black screen! Please fix it!! It's certainly worth 5 stars if it loaded 100% of the time! Thanks :)",
        "Best app ever. I really like It but one problem. Can you please allow spaces on the name like  *Otaku world*  Because it would be more better :D  And I like All the character's and the kawaii Ai chan :3  I really do like this game. I love anime and I love how you can chat with your friends. But if you touch the person in the menu like when you touch the Tummy when your on to the next heart. Can she PLEASE say *Baka! Watashi no yo ni watashi ni furenaide kudasai!* If you know what this means. Your Game is very fun ;)",
        "I'm surprised by how much I really enjoy this game. This really does deserve a 5 star but the reason why I'm only giving 4 is because there's only 2 log in options. I would really love it if there was an option to log in using my email account because I don't use Facebook. I'm really scared something might happen to my game progress.",
        "the game is almost perfection, however there are still room for improvement on minor details, like font and in game description as most of the description are cut off half way if too long. also events should be roll out more timely than to throw you ll at one there's too much to focus on. overall the game is great."

        "Highly addictive. Great fun. Only downside Is, when you get to higher levels, upgrading buildings takes way too long. I'm talking days! Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "I really enjoyed this game for a while. But anytime theres any sort of update the app wont load up. And it just so happens that whenever this occurs it's during a kill event. I cant explain how stressful this game can become if you actually commit to playing it",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "Cannot get the app to load properly, but it is a really fun and addictive game. Great challenges, and I like seeing what designs others have come up with. I've won challenges with very little money, it is possible, if that is a concern for people. I would like to see challenges developed more quickly, and ways to earn more money. I usually have very little money to work with. Maybe have an option to get keys or money when voting. But overall I really enjoy the game."

But dont be soo greedy. please make some more events and make some balance in duel or whatever because of course i cant win against someone like 45lvl when I'm 30 no? And the summoning rate is low mystery amulets are only one for a week lol i think it will take 10 years to get ssr for me. I dont want to leave this game please make something thanks you.",
        "I loved the game when I played the beta. Turn based rpg with different parables within the story mode. Unique unit designs. I cant get very far with the game because the audio echoes itself to the point where its almost hard to understand what is happening. Its a good thing there is subtitles. The game prides itself on its audio aspect by recommending \"use earphones for best experience\" before starting, and I would really love to hear the game.",

Also the packages in the game ate way overpriced. Some skins in the Chinese server are free (ie moonlight blossom yuki onna) whereas in NA server you have to pay to get it. Honestly if the playing field is equal between the NA and the Asia server were equal, I'll stay in the NA server. Right now I'm going to move back to the Asia server even tho I can barely read the story.",
        "I love absolutely everything about this game. Its perfect...accept for one very big detail. Sadly, the characters that have unique and strategic skills are amazingly fun but will never amount to anything in pvp. The good characters are all too easy to play with and it becomes dull due to the lack of thought it takes to win. PVP is a disaster in gameplay and matchmaking. Otherwise, this game is very good.",
        "It's a beautifully made game with a good story line involved. Sure it can be pay to win and all that, but nothing that a bit of hard work can't catch up to.  The controls are easy enough to understand and the combat system is just as simple. It does offer a few unique things such as the shared resource for bigger and better attacks, but it only adds to the depth of the combat system. All in all it's a good game and well thought out.",
        "It's a fantastic game. It would be nice to lock actions so when you're on auto you don't waste orbs. You can pay alot to get more summons but it's all about grinding out the materials and taking the time to level up the guys you want. Would recommend for anyone who loves a good farm/grind game."

Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "Fun way to pass time and super addictive but most of the levels are insanely hard. Some can only be completed if you're lucky enough to get the bonus items in the right place. Also the safe box is getting on my nerves. I thought it was a limited time offer and would go away but it's been there for 2 weeks now!",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

        "Really entertaining story. Great tactics gameplay and characters. I enjoyed this much more than I expected. Steve Jobs said, good artists borrow but great artists steal and I feel that that is what this game did. Very heavy Naruto vibe with Logi and Dias. Then of course,  the Full Metal Alchemist feel with alchemy and the door of truth and leaving part of your body on the other side of the door in order to gain power. 7 kingdoms, 7 deadly sins. This had a good animated opening and song. This game has been very entertaining and I'm looking forward to the next episode to see what happens next. Good stuff, Gumi.",
        "Quite unique game with active players who already experienced the japanese version. UI needs lots of improvements, my goodness! Like Units page must have a back button, and be available not only when going back from Home (Talk abt inconvenience). Loot pieces on-hand should be available when newly acquired loots are pressed and hold! Screen transition also needs optimization for faster reaction.",
        "So far I have only been playing the game for a few hrs. The graphics are sharp and the controls are easy to learn. My only complaint is you can't turn the camera a complete 360 to get a better look at where you opponents are. Other than that it's a great game. Closest thing to Final Fantasy Tactics on Android. Love it.",
        "Best Turn based tactic game. You dont need to be a whale to be good bcos of10% \"rainbow\" summon chance. The stage and event is quite challenging. The only problem is MULTIPLAY. Please make the player can switch between private (code) room to public so that if we only wait for 1 friend, we can switch to public to fill the other 2 slots. It is because if we go to public there is a high chance our friend cannot enter our room bcos of full slots. And then force us to disband and recreate room over and over just to make our friend enter our room.",
        "Game is SUPERB, however it will be awesome if devs could implement following suggestion 1. Quest mission pop up is super annoying if we want to manually farm the equipment in the story mission. 2. Try again mission should be automatically enter the dungeon instead of choosing the team formation. 3. Auto go option, so player can easily farm the dungeon.",
        "Great VAs and story. What I mostly disliked is how slow the combat is even with the accelerated mode, to grind materials it can be quite annoying if you lack skip tickets. I hope they add an option to skip combat animation soon."

        "Time to Uninstall, new server open every week and nothing new about the game. Lag and disconnect every 3-5 min. It's got worst after S17 open.. this game is the same as Loong Craft just different skin. But at least loong craft server is much more sturdy. Please DON'T tell me to check connection or reinstall the game, because I already did it 3 times, connection it's perfectly fine, cuz all my other game I play run just fine.",
        "This game is really a good and fun game. Unfortunately, the dev ... just like most devs ... open the new server all the time which made players from old servers keep migrating to new one. After 2 weeks playing, you'll start to see empty cities in several nations. The dev nees to stop opening new server and start to merge the old servers. If not, this game won't last long.",

I will change my ratings after I recovered my character. Thank you.",

Instead of focusing to the last server they had. When saying that the server is FULL it doesnt mean that all character here is active, when the new server is open everyone choose to  go there. What will happen to the other nation on the old server??? Some are ghost nation, coz everybody quits becoz of new server. Please fix this issues. Thank you.  Please bring back my 6000 power loss on my character on s25",

The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",
        "good way to teach us to be patient should we prefer to play freely.   Occasionally error.  KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "entertains well. but plz try to improve the swiping feature ncz when we want to play the first or second episode ,have to swipe all over down n got fed up with that, its taking too much time to do so. its really urgent to improve that thing.",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",
        "Very disappointed in this app over the last several months.  Every time I go into app to play game I get kicked out.  It is not always immediate which is very frustrating because I will loose lives etc UN-necessarily."

        "Nice game but the way they select the game players within the same \"strenght\" is unfair. Because they use infamy to measure your lv but at the same time you can get infamy even when you die in the first seconds of a match. In that way you are obligated to face strong enemies because your team is good enought to win the battle without you. In that case the game delievers a bad experience for the player.",
        "Plz push an update to hide chat button during battles, while battle the screen should be much cleaner with minimum icons on screen or transparent eg weapon icon. Auto on off header which shows ship names icons etc to enjoy the game screen on mobile.  Ship score is added but how know the quality / grade /% over the other strong ships where do our ships stand on that point of the certain ship levels.   Sea texture and colour need to be more improved, i really love the water in the poke'go. The way it appers its great. Plz add weather effects lightings nights Strom snowy etc head lights to ships, Reload animations, ship colour paint jobs decals,",
        "Could you fix the guild rivalry page. After battles when people go to check the quests etc. it does not pull up. Have to exit game and restart. Happens a lot and gets frustrating. Other than that it's a very good game",

        "Bear with me here.  How about introducing a pulse that stuns? A yellow item, radius 5, 1 slot point and stun duration probably shorter than the Tesla stun in the respective training level.  OR!  have the fixers pulse gain the ability (training maybe) to stun enemies for like 1-2sec. Same duration as when a Tesla shield is forcefully taken down. (not so sure about the second one, but the first seems good)",
        "I love this game and the fact that all the pictures of the game above aren't hyped up. They are the real game. The game is good and I love being able to select my weapons I'm still figuring the system out completely but it's great overall. The only thing I might ask for is a slightly better tutorial"

I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!",
        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

But, Paradise seems pretty cool so far, only thing I'm not a big fan of is how everything deals with irl money while in the 'old' one you could build up gems or materials for certain things like VIP levels; also I heard about rewards being given to old players like me? That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",

        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",

It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved",

I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",

And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

        "I'm glad that you've finally thrown in 5v5. It's a lot of fun.  I'm aware you're trying to do your own thing as far as mobas go but I'd appreciate it if you'd consider adding a way to set up your own build before entering que. Many mobas do the same and I enjoy putting my own spin on builds without having to sit in the shop menu in game for 30+ seconds attempting to adjust everything from the standard builds.  Just a thought.  Thanks for this amazing game. =)",
        "The game is pretty good and the 5vs5 was the update I have been waiting for. Very easy to play nice graphics and controls are easy as well. But since the update 3.1 I have been getting bad pings but my internet is pretty good above 5 mbps constant an bing are well below 50. So have been getting thumbs down for rude pings. Kindly check i have been playing this gane for almost 2 years now. I dont want to remove the games.",
        "I've playing vg since its been 2 years before 5v5 update. After the updates i was start matching up time was taking pretty long and when it start to play the screen doesn't show up, after that it return to vg homescreen. Vanglory is one of my favourite game in these years and i don't want to take it off from my device. Try to fix the issue pls.thx",
        "Couldn't get free rewards for halycon, I clicked on them and it did nothing. I also had a rare mystery chest key and When I clicked to use it, it did nothing, not even get rid of the key. I had to reinstall and it still didn't work, please, help. I also never got that free chest for creating a profile. Very much appreciated if you help. I also don't know how to claim my five free heroes and one skin .-. And it shows I have no wins, which I do, but please, this really needs to be fixed!! I'm sure it's not just me who is having this problem. I also can't open my EPIC mystery chest, even though I have a key. Fix this.",
        "Nice gameplay, very good looking graphic for a MOBA game, on phone obviously. Very nice and comfortable controls. Impressive multiplayer and, fighting system. But The only problem i found is sometimes i still disconnecting from games due to low internet connection, but i got a solid 10MBps speed. I hope Super Evil MC quickly fixes this up. Really irritating when im fighting with enemy hero and you just \"pop\" disconnected. The others features are just fine.",
        "50 mbps connection with 47 pings tested during gameplay. Every time i start vainglory 5v5, works well. 10 mins in the ping goes to 30000 ms. I close the game and go to speedtest to check if my network works fine. ITS BEEN WORKING GREAT THE WHOLE TIME. i get back on the game and the ping is still 30000 ms till it goes back to normal after 5 mins. 5 MINS LOST. and after the game is over? DESERTER! do not push updates when your servers cant handle it. Its been happening to many players but they keep on thinking its their nets fault. Smh..."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Devs don't listen, battle fields are very imbalanced and half dead really. It's really a pay to play game so be prepared for that. It could be fun if they would pay more attention to players and not so concerned with how to make you pay for the next thing.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor"

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it.",
        "I love this game as it's challenging but not ridiculously hard! Very addictive & u can get coins & power ups within the game, 2 help u, so there's no need 2 buy any! 🤗 Pity more games aren't like that!! 😊"

        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "Had friends refer me to the  games. At 1st I wasn't  happy I couldn't  just  select  the games I wanted to play I had to earn the level it was on to open them. It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm",
        "Have so much fun playing this. It's nice to be able to have a \"flutter\" and not use real money. Good fun, great graphics and so many different slots to choose from, plus the rewards are well worth it. Thank you hof! Awesome!! Love this game! Though only one thing to gripe about, the adds are becoming more invasive. Despite this I thoroughly enjoy myself! So keep it up!"

Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",

I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

Some of my favorites are in the  classic section. I have been playing for several years. Today I am upset because of deleted chips, went from 1.2m won 690k but they did a minus instead of add. Grrrrrr  😊 Today my chips are multiplied, I'm doing great. It's a fun game.",

I only have it because of my BF Friends and I have money invested in it. BF don't seem to care that the luster is gone from a lot of their players or even care to bring it back!  😕😕😕😕 Still hoping for the best though!",

Plenty of freebies and bonuses are good. Meet and chat with people around the world. Download now and have a good time playing slots, blackjack, roulette, Texas holdem, burn 3 poker, or Big Fish Fields horse racing. Cheers!   Don't plan on winning.",
        "I'm addicted to Big Fish and I keep  coming back for more!  No matter how many other casinos I've tried, Big Fish is right up there at the top!!!  The graphics are good,  the bonuses are good and the tier rewards are the best!!  The social aspects are really good plus you get rewards for/and from friends.  The only thing I would change is the ability to give gold.",

BFC ONLY CARES ABOUT TAKING MONEY FROM PEOPLE WHILE RIGGING THE SYSTEM AMONGST OTHER UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR. GOOGLE PLAY SHOULD BAN THIS SCAM APP."

        "It started out as a simple companion app and has evolved into an everyday game. I still feel there's a lot of untapped potential. Needs to be more customizable. I see a lot of players with the same or similar team as mine. Needs more team involvement. Overall they have done a pretty good job with the new additions altho a story mode would be nice. The next step is obvious. Rather than 1 year at a time. They need to keep it going and just update when the new 2k drops. I would actually spend money if this were the case. Knowing this game is done in a few months makes me reluctant to do so. Do this and I guarantee ur profits will soar. I'm not the only one that feels this way",

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",
        "This is not actually a review its more like tips for those who like to play the game. I started playing on December and I already have a chopper. I could easily build a second one. The alpha bunker is the best place to get parts. Try using the traveller and selecting 5% chance to find a car part before you open the treasure boxes. Keep the best weapons for the  bunker.  Spots that appear on the main map that have timers are the only places you will find your body incase you die out there. If this is helpful I will give more tips on clothings.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and addicting, with patience.  My only complaint is that everytime i die,  which is often,  i lose all my stuff and can never find my body again.  I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",
        "WARNING: every time you update the game, it cannot connect to your google play account for god knows how many hours or even days! The risk of losing all your progress is VERY high. If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",
        "I love the game. But seriously? You get 1 energy every 5 minutes and at minimum need 13 energy to get somewhere... Also why do you stop letting us watch ads? It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",
        "I'm done with this game... I have spent hours on it and despite being level 99 the game has stagnated. This latest update... Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game."

        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update",
        "its a nice game, but please rate the places lil bit low, it's hard to earn money, and when we save it for a place to buy, a raid takes place... increase the spin no. also atleast from 50 tp 60... it was fun at first.. but due to all this it's becoming boring.",
        "I'm honestly speechless at how simplistic this game is, but it so fun! It's so simple to play, everything about this game is just AWESOME! It's super addicting, a great time killer, eveeything is just great about this. I don't usually rate games but this one made me rate it, keep up the good work!"

If you are a Westerner do not play or pay on this game.  Their customer service sucks.  They actually try to get you to feel sorry for them.  Its amazing.  They will only steal from you.",

        "Nice that this game is helpful to a point. Yes could be a little bit more forthcoming about items and there do's and don't on Upgrades and applications",
        "Just getting started I guess",
        "The graphics are great and the game play is interesting but it's very independent to new players; from other players as well as the system itself. Like things that have been improved on in this genre of game in other apps are still frustrating here. Oh well, what can I expect from a freemium game? Overall it's enjoyable but I have to take it in doses; basically until I get frustrated by the gameplay or other players. All in all, there are worse was to spend your time."

        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star",
        "Will change my review after connection issue is fixed. The most recent update made this game unplayable. I have played for over a year without issue but not now I cant update the game in app at all. It gets to the end of the update and hangs there then it gives me a download fail no matter what I do. ****Update**** It seemed to download today but I have lost over 3 days of logins which sucks. Looking at the bright side though I can play again ^_^."

        "The makers of this game have absolutely no respect for the people who play this game.  So many bugs and errors and yet not even a single fix or update. That too when you have to pay for having this game! You can't go beyond playoffs if you're playing My Career cuz the game crashes every time without saving the progress. Stupid untimely commentary makes it worse. Absolutely disappointed!",
        "Overall, the game is fine if u ignore the jersey error during after game interviews and the commentator commenting on the wrong things. However, when I reach the last game of the season in my career, it always hang and crash and cannot proceed to playoffs. Also, after a playoff series, the last game always crash after the interview. Please solve this problem asap. Thanks guys. Additionally, after replays, the screen will just be black. Also, the flickering at the bottom of the screen. Please attempt to fix all the issues. We pay $10 for a reason thx",
        "FIRST of all pretty cool game. But the audio is trash. Like commentators have no dialogue and they can't get people's names. Like they kept calling OG annuboy Chris Paul and why haven't they gotten Zach Lavine name. They always call him number 10. Why is Malcolm brogdon still bald. Besides that I suggest that you buy this game. Dennis Schröeder doesn't even have his name on there.",
        "Y'all real deal need to fix these issues with the game. Especially, when it comes to playing in the playoffs. Every time I play, it always kicks me out. Another issue, is the commentator speaking the wrong information. PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES, OR REFUND ALL MY MONEY BACK. INCLUDING THE MONEY I SPENT BUILDING UP MY CREATED PLAYER. NOT NOW, BUT RIGHT NOW, FIX THE GAME",
        "The game is perfect on the go! im only playing on low settings in a samsung galaxy 7 and for me its still good and its fast. I tried playing in all high settings but its a bit laggy and delayed. As a mobile game its perfect for nba 2k fanatics. However if you expect it to be the same as a pc or a console game then this is definitely not for you",
        "Crashes after my second playoff game over and over. And I lost money that I payed and have to start all over. I want my money back. Also I have tried to email yall and that's not a real email address. It comes back not found. I'm gonna find out who you are and my lawyer will get on top of this. Have a good day"

There are many players on this server that have well over 300 million power. There is even 1 player with over 980 million power. It is absolutely disgusting how blatant the cheating is. I brought it to the attention of support and they have done nothing. So in my honest opinion this game is definitely not even worth downloading.",

How can i give it 5 stars and recommend it to my friends. I play and pay to support and enjoy this game and now this is how you give back to your players? How can this be resolve? I want my account back!!!",
        "The game itself is great though I have some comments / suggesfiins: First, there may be lots of characters to acquire however, using your new player disregards all your previous efforts. Youll start with level 1 and work again on improving it. The worse part is that the rewards on the career were already consumed by your previous character. Another thing is the stats for the purchased characters. Its almost the same as with the free ones. Shouldnt there be any advantage in acquiring characters by spending for the game?",
        "From 5 stars to 1 star or even No stars!  After the bear update many of my fashions has gone!  Well played BH i used to love this game so much -_- but now im uninstalling it my heart breaks 💔",
        "Im using Pf when i try to fake and shoot under the ring the text appears and in the way of the ball so i cant see ball when i rebound, remove text please. I suggest make the ball blinking blue instead of stupid text.. Or maybe make the text transparent so i can see ball",
        "It is a very fun and addictive game! There is no complain from here except for one thing. I worked so hard to get my desired player yet I have to work from the ground to train him. I was so happy after all those hard work of getting a new player but the current system of player training ball thingy kills my motivation to play the game. If only there is a way to reset or make an entirely new approach of how we could train our newly purchased player then this game deserved a 5 stars, once that is implemented then I will spend my money on this game to further support the development.",
        "The game is ok. The problems are: 1. In the ladder match, you have opponents who have higher skills and levels. Match up should be in same level to be fair. 2. You should have chat options to tell your team mates what to do. 3. There should be an option to penalize players who went offline or afk specially in ladder match. Because of these problems it makes the game annoying."

Other than that, this game doesn't have class system while i really like games with class system... The skill are standarized so there are no challenge in it too... For the background, it is quite good...",
        "The game's awesome and addictive! A little work on the controls and fix some bugs, though. Also, if you could slow down releasing new servers, please do so. Since yesterday, two new servers have already been released. But, overall, the game is amazing!",
        "It was kinda creepy and stalkerish, it kept asking for my personal info like making phone calls which i cant move on unless i give access to all the personal info stuff. I didnt like it at all and it made me very uncomfortable"

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "Not only are the graphics realistic, there so persise on everything. They even allow you to purchase different variety of guns. I just wish they let you assemble your own gun, which of course accessories. Best sniper game I've ever played.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "I want my money back.sick of it now. Don't spend money on it guys not worth it.i have lost loads of point without even playing on the arena.the game has just take them from me"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "Rayark has done it again. I loved how the first one was and i really love this 2nd installment to cytus. Great graphics, good music, and a good story that unravels the more you play it. But what bumbs me out is you have to pay 10 bucks for the other characters that u can get. But its still good and adds more story and songs to the game. Thank Rayark for another great game. P.S, i wonder if you guys should do a sequal to Voez, that would blow my mind if that happened",
        "I love this game. Enjoyed it so much and can't help but wish you guys to create a music album for this. Buying all the other characters was worth it, and Cherry's songs instantly became my favorite. I do hope you guys could update the rest of the story in Cherry's part though :) but I will wait for that to happen, hopefully soon. Thank you for creating such a wonderful game, as what I expected from creators of Deemo and the previous Cytus I. All in all, the whole game is fantastic and U would definitely recommend it to anyone &lt;3 ^_^",
        "No mere DLC masquerading as a sequel, Cytus II introduces a handful of new mechanics alongside a host of quality-of-life improvements that greatly polish the already stellar Cytus formula. The new song collections are grouped by genre, making it easy to find a track that suits your mood. My only complaint is that it's hard to go back to the original. Here's hoping that at least a \"Best of Cytus Classic\" makes its way to II.",
        "Been waiting for this and now it's here. Rayark did a very Good Job on this one. The Improvement on the Graphics with the SFX is truly Magnificent. The Price for it was really worth it but could you please give us, who Pre-Reg'ed a little bit of reward? Like a Trial for all the other Albums like Xenon, ConneR & Cherry? The other Albums are a bit Pricey but I think it's worth it. Good Games like these needs to be Supported for further Improvements.",
        "To be honest I love your music games. I been into it after know about Cytus then Deemo. I been looking forward for more game from Rayark and you come out with Cytus II. Overall the graphic and song perfect,but then I realize the gameplay slightly different the touch more sensitive then the first one. I don't mind pay for the song,but I hope the gameplay would be much better in future. Looking forward to see different platform game from Rayark!",
        "A Sequel of Cytus, version II. Great as always. Cytus I was really awesome back at that time and now this Cytus II just as awesome as 2018 rhythm games. Even the gameplay are identical, I could feel really different experience to a next level (maybe because adding flick and super long note made those a lot difference).  The graphic are really awesome. I really liked the theme and all the details are really awesome. But I got an issue. I'm using Xiaomi Mi Max 2 with Snapdragon 625 but I'm experiencing frame drop when holding notes, maybe still unoptimized for android. Rayark should fix unoptimized graphic this because for mid range processor like SD 625 should not experience frame drop, at least give us an option to reduce graphic quality.  The music and the charts are really awesome as always. I really enjoyed them."

You know what we are waiting for. Yes! MAKE this world at last, please, and people who love RO will give you 5 stars! I know that soon there will be Ragnarok Mobile developed by a Chinese studio.

Please get my character back, it will be greatly appreciated.",
        "Its a great game and competitive. I suggest making a no enemy map with a fairly gain exp from the mob because some of us just finished all the quest and want to just keep our heroes online and grind. Or how about a bounty system where you can hunt a number of mobs with unlimited try's. This game has a lot of potential considering the similarities from the longtime online mmorpg games where i was once played and was now a phone version with a wide world. I hope there will be many functions to come and long live.",

The game worked so well and was soon fun to p,at a while ago but when I came back to it it's soo laggy it's not even letting me talk to NPCs and it's taking about 6 or 7 hits from specials and regular attacks to register and one attack. Its bad enough no one speaks English in chat at least let me do the needed quests. And I can't even gett loot from dungeons because it disconnects me before I can claim the rewards and I can't redo the dungeon.",

Plsss help me with this i want to try to recharge...",
        "Good graphics with open world pvp and pk. The only problem is this huge gap between VIP and none VIP. This is a pay to win game, like 4 none vip level 80s killing 1 high VIP level 80 and still the VIP won. And you need to top-up to join events. Only loaders can get rare mounts, items and pets from mall.",

I uploaded screenshots on Facebook... Nothing!! Maybe they read here and fix my account. I don't want to think that i spent some money for a product that is not functioning.

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

Especially when you get the precious card.. feels like you want to collect all the card. I always appreciate dalcom for giving a new update and a new song every week. Thx btw Edit: but my only question is what for ticket needed for the game? Its just show 0 and never changing",
        "It's perfect; fun, beautiful and just the right amount of competitive.  But ever since the latest update, it stops loading for me at 60% during start up. I'm using a Redmi 4x, and previously, I only experienced this issue when they were having server maintenance. But now it's a constant problem.   Please help, I'm missing out! I want to keep playing more 😭😭😭.",
        "Absolutely beautiful! I don't know if this is possible but if you can, maybe add a chat room? It gets kinda boring when I'm all alone because Im the only one who plays this game in my group of friends. I would also like to chat to the people who I'm competing with and see what they think! It doesn't have to be like you can choose who. Maybe the same ppl you are in the league with. But overall a gorgeous game!",
        "I really think the game is awesome. The graphics are good and even if you're not a BTS fan you'll enjoy it.   I just have one problem, whenever I select to play Boy in Luv for both the easy and normal level, it doesn't proceed to the game screen. It's just stuck on the 'now loading' screen. Not sure if this is coz of my phone although I don't have any problems playing the others songs. Hope you can help me on this.",
        "O-MY-GWAD! I really do love thiiiiis! Waaaa! So A.R.M.Ys, People! Listen! DOWN-LOAD-IT-NOW! And I'm sure you'll never ever regret it! It's very useful! Everyday, you'll have a daily reward… but, make sure you won't skip any… especially, their birthday's… you will get 10 headphones *lives* and 10 cards! You can sell the cards, but me… I can't lose them so I never sell them. It's very exiting! You didn't know what will happen next… but, I recommend you to give yourself a bucket of patience… I promise! It's so hard to start… but very, amazing when you complete it… WITHOUT ANY MISS!!! THREE STARS AND A RANKING UP YOU'LL GET… AND THAT IS WHAT I CALL HAPPINESS…♥♥♥",
        "I just want to complain about one thing. Every time I update the app, all of my score will disappear. It's very tiring to play every single song and stage AGAIN just to have a score and when I get the latest update, it disappeared AGAIN. OMG, just please fix this... I really love this game! So please fix it. I hope it doesn't happen again."

The only problem is that its starting to get complicated with all the new functions such as the divine cards and the crystals, EF.. Dont make the players do too many things, the selling point of this game for me in the beginning is that theres not much to do, so i can just do my work while in auto or go out and still be able to finish everything in the game before reset.. Now the working players cant keep up.. Which might force us to quit..",
        "Great! Pros- Graphics is great(Doesn't give headaches like other arpg games). Skill combos looks cool. Game is easy to understand. Cons- Classes are gender locked and male classes sucks. Suggestion- Add 1-2 more classes male and female. Question- When is the new Server going to be released? It's boring when all the other players are already OP, I only see 2-3 newbies everytime i login.",

Now, people don't even bother to join RB. I think if the rewards were to be changed with something more useful, then players will be encouraged to join RB again, thus forming more solid guilds and more players. Just saying...",

It's designed very well, the map is great, everything about it is great. However, i was talking in discord with some people and they said that they couldn't play ranked. I launched the app, and i saw that i could not play it either. I hope this gets fixed soon, good luck! Edit: I can now play ranked mode, 5 stars",

One last thing, the co-op mode has some bug where u created the room but unable to start the game even when u have enough player. Please fix that, thank you.",
        "I think it's a good game. Suck that you have to pay money to go up against other people that already have SS Hero's. Just wanted to say y'all should make at least more S hero's that are FTP so y'all can get people to get back into the game I don't want this game to die off.",
        "The game is really addictive. Hours of game play and activities. I really like it. However, since it's international the time for coop game should be more flexible so i can join with my friends at suitable time. Tournament matching is a little bit unbalanced, either it's a raid or it's a total defeat. And heroes skills should  give more details on stats, so we can plan effectively. Thank you for such a good game.",
        "They are about to make it more of a money trap with an update that screws f2p and budgeted p2w. They say they have free events and events so part time p2w have fun. Then why are people talking about quitting? These are high paying players. I know you plan on making it so hero's bought for special skills like stun and silence won't work if there's a big gap. You've made it so hero's bought for the purpose of moving these budgeted p2w are useless. So it's in favor of real p2w. It should be a reverse. Make the lower people have a better chance not a worse one.",

        "Really enjoy this game but its very hard to do well unless you pay real money to buy extras! There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5☆",
        "I love this game, but some of the glitches are very annoying. For example I just bought a shirt for a challenge and it will not let me use it. This has happened before. I've probably lost a few thousand dollars of in game money because of this glitch. There are other glitches but that's the worst one. Overall the game is fun though."

Now, I've spent my gems to unlock the full set, only to not recieve the sound. I don't know if this is just for my device, but I'm hoping to hear the music. I'm not really disappointed, but just slightly. I would really love for the bug to be fixed, nonetheless I really enjoyed the game. Thank you.",

The game will only load for a very long time, and not letting me to claim my reward. The second problem is I the clothes that I've bought from the store cannot be worn on Nikki. I really do enjoy this game so much but please repair all of the bugs.",

Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted."

    "description" : "HỢP KÍCH 36 THẾ - XƯNG ĐẾ THIÊN HẠ“Một trong những sản phẩm game thẻ tướng chiến thuật chất lượng nhất đến từ Studio của Netease – một trong những công ty game lớn nhất thế giới, Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng xứng đáng là trò chơi công phá năm 2018 được game thủ kì vọng nhất.” – Sendor Grimer – BTV Gamek.vn1. PHÁT HÀNH TOÀN CẦU VỚI NHIỀU NGÔN NGỮ TẠI NHIỀU QUỐC GIAPhát triển từ một Studio thuộc Tencent, Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng đã được phát hành tại 6 quốc gia thị trường lớn trên thế giới bao gồm: Malaysia, Indonesia, Thái Lan, Hồng Kông, Đài Loan, Macao và bản tiếng Anh toàn cầu. Việt Nam chính là thị trường tiếp theo phát hành trò chơi chiến thuật đang cực kì thành công này.2. ĐẶC THÙ VÀ DUY NHẤT: BỘ TƯỚNG HỢP KÍCH – XUẤT CHIÊU BÍ TRUYỀNTrong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng, mỗi bộ tướng đều có duyên phận, không chỉ kích hoạt các chỉ số đặc biệt khi cùng có mặt trong trận hình, mà còn giúp nhân vật mạnh nhất trong bộ tướng đó thay đổi kĩ năng hoàn toàn mới để xuất tuyệt chiêu hợp kích Bí Truyền. Đây là tính năng chưa một game chiến thuật nào có trên thị trường Việt Nam hiện tại.3. THỜI TRANG QUYẾT ĐỊNH CHIẾN THUẬT – ĐỔI THỜI TRANG, ĐỔI KĨ NĂNGHệ thống thời trang của Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng không chỉ đẹp, “khủng” mà còn đem đến những chỉ số, hiệu ứng thuộc tính và bộ kỹ năng mới đặc thù trên từng bộ thời trang. Vì vậy, khi thay đổi thời trang, nghĩa là người chơi sẽ thay đổi hoàn toàn đặc tính và chiến thuật của trận hình. Đặc biệt, các bộ thời trang này không được cộng dồn thuộc tính, khiến cho trò chơi trở nên trí tuệ hơn nhiều.5. GIẢI ĐẤU ĐỈNH PHONG – VINH DANH TẠC TƯỢNG LIÊN SERVERĐây là tính năng PvP thi đấu liên server trong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng, nơi hội tụ tất cả những game thủ mạnh nhất tại các server, tham gia tranh tài để tìm ra người chiến thắng. Giải đấu được tổ chức như một vòng chung kết WorldCup, thi đấu chia bảng và các vòng đấu cực kỳ hấp dẫn. Ngoài danh hiệu, được tạc tượng liên server, người chơi tham gia giải đấu sẽ nhận thưởng điểm tích lũy dùng để đổi lấy các mảnh tướng Đỏ siêu hiếm. Người chơi khác cũng có thể ủng hộ, bình chọn và cổ vũ những người chơi tham gia giải đấu để nhận thưởng nhiều phần quà giá trị.6. 37 HIỆU ỨNG – TÙY HỨNG TRẬN HÌNH – SO TRÌNH CHIẾN THUẬTChiến thuật trong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng được thay đổi liên tục thông qua các hiệu ứng kĩ năng của tướng như tăng tốc, hóa đá, đóng băng, thiêu đốt, x2 sát thương… Các hiệu ứng này sẽ ảnh hưởng mạnh mẽ đến cách chơi và cách bố trận của game thủ sao cho hiệu quả nhất, từ đó phân định đẳng cấp trí tuệ của người chơi.7. HỆ THỐNG PET ĐA DẠNG, BUFF HIỆU ỨNG TĂNG CHỈ SỐ CHO TƯỚNGTiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng là một trong số hiếm các game chiến thuật có sử dụng hệ thống Pet khi xuất trận. Các Pet này khi xuất chiến sẽ cộng chỉ số khá lớn cho tướng trong đội hình bao gồm cả hiệu ứng. Mỗi Pet sẽ có các chỉ số riêng tùy thuộc vào chiến thuật của người chơi mà tùy biến sử dụng loại Pet hợp lý khi xuất trận. Pet cũng là một trong những thứ có thể show hàng thể hiện sự độc đáo, oai phong cho nhân vật.8. BẠN SẼ KHÔNG CÔ ĐƠN KHI CHƠI GAMEMặc dù là game thẻ tướng chiến thuật Tam Quốc, thế nhưng Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng không hề “tự kỉ” khi có rất nhiều tính năng cộng đồng cho phép tương tác giữa người  chơi với nhau. Với hệ thống bang hội đặc sắc, bang chiến khốc liệt, tổ đội tinh anh, vận tiêu bang hội, công thành chiến, phụ bản liên server, voice chat liên server… thì bạn sẽ không thể cảm thấy cô đơn khi tham gia vào game.

        "At first I thought it was great, but now I realise it's just another PAY-TO-WIN game... You've got no chance if you come up against a paid-for character like Batman. It's such a shame this is the way game devs are heading these days.",
        "*Update Very greedy company-&gt; bad rating from me! They sell packages for 200-300 dollars! What's worse is that there are people who are stupid enough to pay for it. Aside from that a very cool game. To be at the very top it is pay to win. Besides that really cool. Lots of heroes and therefore possibilities.",
        "It's a great game don't get me wrong but as I wrote in previous reviews they just went completely pay-to-win. Nowadays you cannot win not only because you don't have the latest gacha heroes, you just can't win because they released Batman for $160 to be competitive, most broken character ever. They are also releasing legendary pets... For $400 each. So yes, forget about having a fun competition, some players are simply out of you range by how much money they have spent and that ruins the experience.",
        "My first review disappeared so I will leave another.  This game was great at first, then it started inserting the buyable characters such as Batman, Assassin's Creed and they are so over powered, one of them can take down your whole team without taking any damage.  Game is now so unbalanced that it isn't worth playing.  Until they fix the game, it worth playing.  Unless you like wasting money to feel like a god with over powered characters.  Game is dead, play something else.",
        "definitely one of the best game if not the best game ived ever played on mobile. when you pull a hero for free the feeling is incomparable. the strategy you need to bring down other tougher players/guilds, its all here i tell ya! and to cap it all off the customer service is GREAT. you have concerns they reply ASAP what more could one ask for?!  install now! =)",
        "Had the potential to be good but they care more about money than a good game, once you progress so far you will constantly lose to ppl who have bought characters that are vastly over powered. They will auto reply and say plenty of ppl still have fun without out paying, I made it to level 65 and it's just not true."

        "This game is the most addictive gave ive ever play.. i go 24/7 online just to make strong.  I want to suggest change arena system. Its kind of boring. And make trade gems so its not waste",
        "Why is it shutting off everytime i enter a dungeon or if almost i kill the boss dungeon? This pisses me off.. but nice game if its fixed.. and pls do add some free GOOD items in game.. hard to earn good gears.. and pls the inventory slot is too few..",
        "Hi! I'm new to the game and I like it. However, I couldn't update the app. I already tried deleting data/cache as well as rebooting my phone, but nothing happened. Any other solution please? Thank you!"

        "Just a heads up. Like I said before you people had this planned. Within this year you have proven your desire. Tell me... when have you played a game that changes like a leaf in the wind? I have never seen any Developer change core functions like you have. Wonder why others used to love this game? It's not the graphics! Summoner Wars and Clash of Clans have you beat! Wonder why? They add and not change everything in just a few days like you have. Like I said before...You reap what you have done.",
        "Actually... I was bored and installed this game and I noticed that my gameplay didn't diminished even after the stall was removed. Actually, now that I think about it, I didn't even use the stall that much. I take it back. I am so sorry for the negativity that I showed. I love this game so much. Btw I didn't spend real money on this game lol.",
        "I love this game so much, but there's always a moment when I enter a room that the fade-in heavily lags. I always thought it was just making the area entry take longer, but it's actually gotten me killed upon entering one of the pvp areas, so it's definitely not normal. Nothing I've changed in the system settings has worked, so I really hope I'm not the only one this is happening to. Also, I think the water elemental magic for the Summoner is bugged: I used it several times in the base and main tower, and it hit in wildly different spots depending on whether I was aiming for an enemy or not. With no enemy in your direct line of sight, the spell always hit directly in front of me, but if I tried to attack a monster with it, it hit in a spot much further ahead instead. This is actually a huge problem because it's effectively impossible to aim the spell. I hope these are addressed in future updates.",
        "Only thing I ask is that u make summoner advanced classes I suggest mabey a nechromancer like summons dead can revive friends from death mabey once a day or like three idk mabey make a demon class like a underworld class where all skills are demonic in nature or a animal summoning ability this should have been thought of before class was released btw just saying otherwise amazing game 10/10 in my opinion",
        "Thank you very much Asobimo for helping me to fix my security issue.  Now i can go back to the game.  I really love Avabel!  Lovelots.",

        "Fantastic game.I am loving this game. Still there is few problem.Miniclips please solve the issues. After players matching ,game is hacked/stopped by several times.Only way to win that kind of match,any of one player has to quit or network issues.Its waste of time,also harm for devices (battery drainage,high heating). So,admin plz look after these prob.Why it's hanging or hacking.",
        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "Could you please enable the user to save his progress in a Gmail account??  So that, when you lost or change your phone, you can recover the level and progress you had before instead of restarting from the beginning!!!!!!!!!!!!   If you could allow more media for sharing the game, it would be better, Facebook is not the only social media!!   And sometimes, it bugs!! Sometimes, the game is very slow and causes you to lose. Indeed, you shoot but the ball goes after many seconds even though the connexion is good!! Consequently you loose against a weak player, And this makes very angry!!!   Should those problems fixed, I will rate 5 stars.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person."

I end up having to close the game and never get to see it, then I go into the next Chapter not really knowing what's going on. The story is important to me and it's very unfortunate that this is happening. A fix from the developers or a suggestion on something I can do would be greatly appreciated.",

        "Cars could look better and authentic during the race. They look like miniature toy cars. Not even look like the real car. You should patch the game after some time, after you have the revenue. Cars not even look like they \"look\" in the real life. The gameplay is alright so far, might become enjoyable for a longer gameplay.   Just started, but I wasn't suggested to invite my friends to play. Correct it also for making the community larger. Where is the option to play with my friends? Also, any crew creator option? So far , 4/5. Started yesterday",
        "I normally hate card base games, but I saw the preview as an ad on another game. So I thought it looked good enough to try it out. This game is HELL A LOT BETTER than the preview suggested. It does have pacts of cards to buy with real money, yet at the same time you earn gold coins to buy same packs. You can easily save the gold coins to buy these packs. LOVE THIS GAME",
        "Hi... The game keeps crashing down after the recent update.. Can't even write to the support team about it, it crashes just seconds after I start the game.. Help!",
        "I liked the game but the reason its a 4 is because on the 0 to 150 races i have a car that its high is 157 mph but it just randomly stops at 134 and says dnf my car is way faster plz fix the Chevrolet Impala 1967 and my Chevrolet Camero 1970 can make it to 145 mph on a mile drag but cant make it to 130 mph on a 0 to 150 race, thats bs plz fix these cars' top speeds plz. They r broken",
        "Great game, constantly playing, was crashing this morning but fixed now so up to 5 stars.  Would like more ways to make money once the campaign is 100% complete, maybe more, or replayable campaigns, or new game modes all together, but still great fun.",
        "Since yesterday I can't even the game anymore keeps crashing right after the loading screen I wish that a lot of money on this game if it's not working properly I will complain"

One last thing, the co-op mode has some bug where u created the room but unable to start the game even when u have enough player. Please fix that, thank you.",

However, since it's international the time for coop game should be more flexible so i can join with my friends at suitable time. Tournament matching is a little bit unbalanced, either it's a raid or it's a total defeat. And heroes skills should  give more details on stats, so we can plan effectively. Thank you for such a good game.",

Then why are people talking about quitting? These are high paying players. I know you plan on making it so hero's bought for special skills like stun and silence won't work if there's a big gap. You've made it so hero's bought for the purpose of moving these budgeted p2w are useless. So it's in favor of real p2w. It should be a reverse. Make the lower people have a better chance not a worse one.",

        "the new fusion medals added make it so you can not fuse heros without spending money this game is officially broken theres no free way to advance anymore dont download. its very sad i like the idea behind the medals but whos going to grind with 0 progress for 8 months and still not get thier first 6 star .... its messed up",
        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well"

        "Really entertaining story. Great tactics gameplay and characters. I enjoyed this much more than I expected. Steve Jobs said, good artists borrow but great artists steal and I feel that that is what this game did. Very heavy Naruto vibe with Logi and Dias. Then of course,  the Full Metal Alchemist feel with alchemy and the door of truth and leaving part of your body on the other side of the door in order to gain power. 7 kingdoms, 7 deadly sins. This had a good animated opening and song. This game has been very entertaining and I'm looking forward to the next episode to see what happens next. Good stuff, Gumi.",
        "Quite unique game with active players who already experienced the japanese version. UI needs lots of improvements, my goodness! Like Units page must have a back button, and be available not only when going back from Home (Talk abt inconvenience). Loot pieces on-hand should be available when newly acquired loots are pressed and hold! Screen transition also needs optimization for faster reaction.",
        "So far I have only been playing the game for a few hrs. The graphics are sharp and the controls are easy to learn. My only complaint is you can't turn the camera a complete 360 to get a better look at where you opponents are. Other than that it's a great game. Closest thing to Final Fantasy Tactics on Android. Love it.",
        "Best Turn based tactic game. You dont need to be a whale to be good bcos of10% \"rainbow\" summon chance. The stage and event is quite challenging. The only problem is MULTIPLAY. Please make the player can switch between private (code) room to public so that if we only wait for 1 friend, we can switch to public to fill the other 2 slots. It is because if we go to public there is a high chance our friend cannot enter our room bcos of full slots. And then force us to disband and recreate room over and over just to make our friend enter our room.",
        "Game is SUPERB, however it will be awesome if devs could implement following suggestion 1. Quest mission pop up is super annoying if we want to manually farm the equipment in the story mission. 2. Try again mission should be automatically enter the dungeon instead of choosing the team formation. 3. Auto go option, so player can easily farm the dungeon.",
        "Great VAs and story. What I mostly disliked is how slow the combat is even with the accelerated mode, to grind materials it can be quite annoying if you lack skip tickets. I hope they add an option to skip combat animation soon."

I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",

I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out.",
        "It's not the best game but because I am a fan of naruto my interest in this game might be different than others would think. Overall its a decent mobile game but it could use some more improvements."

Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I've really enjoyed reading All the Wrong reasons.  The author is very talented, a true story teller.  As I was reading I felt like part of the story I was so enveloped in the lives of the characters they were alive and real. I was sad when the story ended wanted to keep reading.  I was overjoyed when K. I. S. S.  came out by that very sane author who transported me to a whole new world yet again. I look forward to reading more from this amazingly talented storyteller!!",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked."

        "Two words: CASH GRAB. Playing this game you'll end spending much more than the most complex app from store or PC. Also packages have different prices depending on level and platform. The higher the level the more will cost. Also playing on an android is cheaper than on an ios device. NOT NICE, NOT FAIR. Also might be illegal.",
        "More benefits should be added to invading a sector. For example if player A invades player B' sector, player A should be able to get resource production boost. Like player A gets 7 percent addtional resource  production of player B'. Example: player A has a titanium production of 1000 each hour(this is before invading payer B's sector). Player B has a titanium production of 500 each hour(this is before the invasion player B's sector). After the invasion, player A's titanium production is 1035 each hour and player B's titanium production is 465 each hour.",
        "Don't bother. Two words to describe this game: CASH GRAB.The game has lost its appeal. Servers crash and they refuse to compensate you for their problems. They make changes to certain aspects of gameplay, then claim nothing changed. They remove features of the game, then leave us wondering why. You'll never see a change log either with updates. There is only one thing they want. Money.",
        "Terrible company to deal with. They only want your money. If something goes wrong and you want their help, they simply ignore you. I lost an account because their server crashed and they just ignored all my requests  Nice response below. Sadly you cannot be contacted that way, and yes, I still have the same problem. Typical response from this company. Direct you to a website you cannot raise issues on",
        "Lately the game it's very slow. Sometimes it's freezing for minutes. After restarting with force stop cache  clearance of the game, can do up to five moves than it's freezes again. Hello admins it takes 30 seconds to access a mercenary op. Clear the bugs please. 04.12.2017  Thanks for useless response. There is not an option for the issues I've asked. Hey people try the link I was given  05.12.2017 My app setup it's on my quick lunch to do the force stop after every 3-4 game moves. Left the game for 10 min to get going still frozen.

        "Well like every game they will trying to grind you and empty your pokets. Buut as gamers with brains we can enjoy the game without waisting money. Its like second world you can meet people and do things with them. I hope they will creat an update that we can realy feel like alive. Than just standing like a wall and only chating. Anyway its simmiler to sims. Give it a try",
        "I love the game, its a great way to hook up with friends. I have one request though. The streaming music is a great idea but I was wondering if u could add in a feature that lets u type in the song u want to hear. I be very happy if u did and even more excited to play this. Edit: also could u pls include a choice to exchange diamonds for coins cause the amount grows fast while ur coins go down at the same speed & it pisses me off",
        "The tapjoy didnt work. What the hell. I played the counting cats and spelling bee and i scored 70% and there's no reward even after 24 hours. If i made a report there, you would simply give me a copy messages and ignored it. What a waste of time",
        "I love the game but with every update it seems to be more problems with mystery box. The videos don't play at all or no reward and these are the non mini game videos. Please fix the game. I will change my rating back to five stars when I can play like when I first started playing. OMG now I can't even log in this is getting frustrating.",
        "Idk, if others are not able to join social spots or message friends or do pretty much anything if your on android. Cuz for me I got nothing this started right after I made a purchase of the second build machine. Ever since then NOTHING has worked EDIT: SOME of these things work but usernames and other things are no longer showing up! Please fix but otherwise great Social game!",
        "I like decorating the houses they are beautiful. I just wish the music from the music streaming stereos doesnt stop when we edit or open a window. It kind of starting all over again whenever that happens. Also the mystery boxeswont open after watching some adverts. Pls fix it. I like this game except the boring part people dont usually chat a lot. But overall this game is ok coz its on the go."

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",
        "Sometimes opponents do not die even after hitting 10-12 headshots.. quiet unfair check on that.. I would give you 5 stars",

        "I love this game! But, there's not enough energy or chances to win energy or earn it. 10 isnt enough!There's times when I'm out of energy and have done everything I can do and have to leave the game but still feel like playing. I've spent money on this game but I don't always have money to buy energy or coins to buy energy. There should be more give-a-ways, prizes, little games, etc to earn more energy so I can keep playing!! Also, I'd like to be able to friend request other players and send them things. Like people on my team on here.  Thank you! Lynn Mauger",
        "Amazing! It is an amazing game that you go and figure out the death of somebody. You go through stages and different areas and you must find hidden objects. You get coins and bucks that you spend on things to make your world. Great time taker.",
        "There are quite a few objects that are incorrectly identified. For example, there is a screen used for changing clothes behind, but it is what you need to find when asked for a \"lamp.\"  The pace is not good. In gameplay, you collect coins used for buying decorations. You have to place decorations to advance the gameplay. But if you have no coins and are at an impasse in the gameplay because you need decorations, you're stuck unless you lay down real cash.  A lot of the problems the developer is aware of, because their next game like this, June's Journey, is much better.",
        "For some reason the game is frozen and won't  go past  the wooga screen it is also doing it on  June's  Journey  please fix because I  really  like  to  play these games",

        "FIRST OF ALL (and this is from my first review) why did it ask me if yhis was a skateboarding game, a role play game or a happy game? Its just funny second up the graphics a bit and lastly i like the call of duty mixed with clash of clans and have its own mechanics",
        "Great graphics good game play. The only problem I have is that there needs to be a base building button it's a pain with the current set-up. Also the rotation of the screen isn't really necessary I don't use it at all. Other than that great game hope you keep improving it",
        "For once, just for once, Activision, please release an update that is bug free. The recent update to 4.6.0 basically renders the war screen useless. On opening the war screen, the game bugs out. Any attempt to fall back to main base layout or to try to go to war overview is useless and it is stuck in the war overlay. Apparently we lost an Alliance war that we would have easily won, thanks to your \"competent\" developers releasing such \"wonderful\" updates.",
        "It's slow paced but has it's moments, graphics are decent for the style of game but the micro transactions are brutal.  Overall fun game but unless  you buy your way up its going to take a LONG time before you are any good",
        "I like the app overall but it can be confusing at times. That could very well be because I don't pay attention to the game sometimes. ❤ an overall 4⭐⭐⭐⭐.",
        "Love the game. One of the best app games out there. Wish you could use apple id accounts with it as well as Google's on an Android device other than that game is sickness"

        "I do like the game because it is fun.  The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is challenging; however, the new update includes an option to purchase updates to units by way of credits, alloy, and crystals.  The wording is not specific and I wasted quite a bit of crystals, credits and alloy and did not receive what I thought I purchased.  Although I am unhappy and will most likely NOT make any further purchases in this game in the future, it is still worth a try.  Just make sure you do not make the same mistake I did.  I do hope the developer reads this and makes the appropriate chsnges.  Enjoy.",
        "Loved it to begin with and spent a lot of actual money to progress...... but it only helped a little, you have to have deep pockets or too much time to get anywhere. Oh and now it's crashed, having to re install just to see if I've lost all my money!",
        "I gave 2 stars.  I used to like this game but not anymore. I am lvl 7 and the only people who ever hit me are lvl 10 bases!!! What is up with that? Don't give me some bs excuse is because regardless, this is not right and I am thinking of quitting because of this.  I'm a paying customer but I won't be spending another dime on this lopsided game.  Thanks for stealing my cash and my time.",
        "Would definitely give at least 4 stars, but there's one thing that really makes me mad: The Attacking/Defending Algorithm. Out my entire squad, I have the least attacks, but I'm the leader, by far, in defenses. I don't WANT to attack anyone yet. I want to farm and get stronger. But I can't do that if I'm getting attacked 7-10 times every hour. Even when I win defenses, I still lose resources. Fix that. Make it to where people that rarely attack, are rarely attacked.",
        "this game used to be good but they have ruined the opponents. being a level 9 on all  units costs more to build to attack than the resources you can scavenge from your opponents. also the developers are allowing hundreds of absolutely identical bases to be produced so even if you decline an attack and are repaired you get matched to a different 'player' but with the same base. it's a disgrace.",
        "The new event challenge is great but the number of times the game crashes now is unbelievable. To make it worse it only seems to crash when I'm almost getting a 3 star win so I then end up with a loss and lose any troops which take ages to rebuild. Please fix it."

        "Where's the 720 potbucks?!  Liars.  Pot farm brought me here.  Need more sexy babes.  A first person shooter mode too, like halo 1 online. Just nother point n click, like bleach online mmorpg.  The game that has all sexy babes no dudes, and the chicks beat dudes and practice femdom, we probably get the highest ratings and be the most popular lol.",
        "This is not the game i watched a video for. I would like to play that game (if it exists) but the link brought me this steamer. I'm sure your well aware of this as you've had plenty of reviews saying as much so its obvious to me you dont care. Great way to build a loyal customer base",
        "The game was fun for a little while, but it becomes quite monotonous. The game isn't interactive enough to keep you coming back for more. You more or less just watch your heroes battle which takes a lot of possible fun out of the game right away. If you spend any cash at all on the game, you unlock the ability to \"raid\" your already completed missions. So then when you need items, you will just mash the raid button until your energy is gone. And the energy recharges VERY slowly. You can play for free, but will progress substantially slower than the pay-to-play player. So overall, it's fun for a short while (a week or two), but you will quickly grow tired of it due to poor interactivity. If you are looking for a game similar to this that will keep your interest and has much more to offer, I would recommend Summoners War.",
        "Game apparently 'malfunctioned' and the heroic chest kept saying open free.  This was after I spent $25 US dollars so of course I thought why wouldn't I get some free opens?  I didn't know they were charging me 200 emeralds a pop.  Customer service was NO help.  Hopefully I can get a refund from Google Play.  Don't download!  Bad programming, scam in game purchases!",

And the balloon pop is fun too! And I won alot of money on the community bonus round. Where the people playing next  to you win during the bonus!",
        "Was good at first but, at a certain point the game is rigged worse than real slots in Vegas. Good rewards and all but, issue I have is I play a certain slot game longer than people who join later and they win large amounts immediately whereas about 90% of the time I lose chips more than win....I even switch up my bets and have bought chips thinking this would get the game to allow wins and nothing. Wanted to get enough V coins for Cirque but rather just pay full price at this point.",
        "I'm 6 levels shy of level 2000 and I just wanted to know if the daily reward and the hourly rewards will ever go up??? That'll be a great opportunity for players who reach a certain level in the game to collect a higher amount of money!!!   Also, how about EVERY weekend you'll do a DOUBLE YOUR MONEY when buying money!!!  That why you'll be making more money and customers can and will be very satisfied ever weekend...   P.S. THANKS FOR THE AWESOME GAME 👍👍👍👍👍",
        "It's cool, but one of the gimmicks is that you can play with other players, the problem is there is absolutely no way to play with your friends, you can only see the progress / help / be helped by complete strangers. Even if you invite a friend through fb... nothing. Not worth downloading until they update it.",
        "21 million in coin, the new game popup hi low comes on. I play, I go back to my game all coins gone. The Emerald 7 kept playing while i was gone evidently. But how does 21 million disappear with a bet of 300k in less than 5 minutes. This is second time I have tried this game. It just wants you to buy coin, jokers.",
        "If you have any problems with your chips, dont expect them to help in any way. I was losing chips after bonus game on cleopatra. They pretty much said its my fault."

Spirit Rest runs rely on speed and now it seems after 10-15 minutes (of inactivity, in an idle game) the game becomes unresponsive until you force close and restart, potentially losing what progress you had made. I know this is an implementation to stop bots but it has only made the game more cumbersome than ever before for living players. Please reverse this Ekkorr! Surely you can find some other way to combat bots without placing such a heavy burden on the rest of us.",

        "Great game. Would have given it 5 stars but a recent update has made the commercials play at max volume. I play the game in silent mode, in bed, while wife is asleep. Sudden barrage of loud commercials has ruined the experience. It has actually resulted in me playing less and therefore has had me watch less commercials. Go figure.",

        "Tried multiple times for them to give me my purchase, I have shown them the evidence and they agree I don't have my in game purchase and have been trying to fix it for ten days and won't issue a refund. Horrible customer service",
        "Was fun at first but then got to the point that you realize planing multi player is a complete rip off.  No one gets the same amounts of bonuses so it's stacked.  Plus the constant losing because of \"disconnected\" issue is a pain.  Uninstalling"

        "I have played this game for years now. Great new levels, still challenging, and fun ways to earn power-ups without having to make a purchase! Loved it until it quit working on my phone. Doesn't even crash anymore, just quits mid-play and I lose whatever progress I'd made. I play when I can on my tablet, but it's just not the same. I don't know why it won't work on my phone without spontaneously closing! 5 stars if it did...",
        "I love, love  this game is difficult to play, but to my opinion is the best game on line ihave been playing for 2 years and my goal is to beat it . you get rewards. I spend money but with the rewards you get something back  ,also I just started another game with is similar like pandapop and iam a also give it 5 stars . even that iam a grandmother of 72 years old. I still popping. !!",
        "A wonderful game to have very fun and exciting install right away you won't regret it. I've reached level 1049. It is super exciting to me learning how to Ricochet the balls off the walls. The projection of the angle need it. This is my all-time favorite and I highly recommend it to my friends and family. Plus, the little bit of flaws and the enemies within the game, will have you taking a break and coming back for more. Just know that I've deleted this game twice but always came back to it because this game , is fun and challenging .  If you don't like a challenge you won't like this game .  Just so you know , it does not require internet, to be able to play this game like others. Technicians please put out more games that don't need the Internet to play. This game is one of them. Just know that option is super helpful. We need more games able to be played without internet intervention. Ty taking time to read this. Have fun a Poppin. LOL",
        "Not bad, not great. Randomly stops in the middle of play and you lose a life. Also takes a long time to load and to move to the next level. Okay for free, but if I paid for it I would be asking four a refund.  Update: I've contacted the developers multiple times. They keep sending the same canned response.  Game crashes frequently. Frustrating when you are just about to finish a level. Uninstalling.",
        "I use to give this a 5 star rating until I lost all of my panda belt progress when I updated, 5 days ago. I sent a report to you and got a message that said there was a problem with the update. I'm still waiting for an answer on when this will be fixed. I refuse to play any levels or specisls, like badboon lair until I can receive the panda belt credits. If I don't receive the panda belt credits or if I am not credited for the points that I lost I will uninstall this game!!!!!",
        "I loved this game and have played it for a few years now. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the last few months, it just closes on me mid play and I lose on my progress, as well as any items and special powers that I used to advance in a level. Very frustrating to lose items and have to start all over on the level."

        "The game has changed over the years to make it easier for any gamer to join at any point and still keep equal grounds with some of the older gamers. Just like any free game their is a \"pay to win\" area in the game, this makes it unfair during the area, in which I thought was great till I descovered it",
        "A long time player here. The app has taken the garbage pay to win route. The event drop rates have been nuked the summon rates are even worse. You literally have no chance at getting any of the LR rarity cards unless you spend hundreds of dollars. It used to be fun and free players actually had a chance to get decent drops in the past. After the inclusion of the tower event everything went downhill.",
        "Ok look I been playing for a year now I gotta say its the same thing over and over and after you put the tower events in it was fun but then you taken the free jewel crystals off for us free players in the tower rewards... Pay to win game.. This game is getting boring",
        "Card art is great, but more importantly surprisingly deep meta plot where characters frequently do throwbacks to past monthly plots. Tho albeit the monthly plot is linear, kinda basic, repetitive x10, and don't get me started on tower events. BUT joining a guild adds a whone other level of fun chatting with other players and the Devs really care about the community! Who offer ALOT of free stuff to free users (especially during the holidays) and aren't afraid to apologize for making a mistake. TLDR: simple game, great devs, and Oracle is best girl",
        "Ever since the October update it has started to crash a lot. Love the game play and graphics but the crashing can be annoying if it happens in the middle of an important battle. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars across the board.",
        "A card battle game with a wide variety of characters and abilities to develop. A perfect game for those with the time and patience to devote to it. And for those in a hurry to win, the gem system lets you buy your way to success and power."

The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this."

Started buying DBs to support you...please include free ssr tickets for 50 and above DB purchase! Sr+ tickets for 40 DBs and less.  You'll have more buyers if you do that. Keep it up!",
        "Nice game to play,very addictive. Unfortunately there's so many bugs in the game,such as freeze suddenly (can't click aything in game),sometimes game ended before 45 min (often ends in 29 min) and force close issue (not responding). Please fix this bug ASAP. Much appreciated. Thanks.",
        "i dont know what to say... i feel grateful for your march event log in bonus. New & old player can snatch 1 SSR player but this new event though why you make it more depressing feature ? i figure playing this game is like working to get money.... i thought this game suppose to be fun and bring childhood memories, i know you need effort to get gold ticket but this \"effort\" is all based on luck already see many people day 1 got 0 gold ticket day 2 got 5 gold ticket...... just how? seriously if u want to make new event at least make it friendly for user i dont see point to play this game all night long to get that rewards your just making people to stay aeay from your game not attracting them shame event",
        "the game is just awsome but it has many cracks. the problem now is that matches don't start they keep loading forever this all happens when the photos in the missions menu appear white space. i don't even know the reason behind it ! i would rate the app 5 stars if it got fixed.  everytime this happens i have to reinstall the app",
        "Remind me of childhood anime.. Good game but have some minor bugs as far as I played.. Should be add ability to substitute players in middle of match, not only when half time rest.. Maybe some dribble or combination attack skill should be used to pass multiple players and get our player closer to the keeper. Please add more story match. Also fix regular online match, it's always freeze.",
        "Never watched the anime but played the game on snes and was a fan ever since. Its great to see it alive. Just wish it wasn't so much pay to win."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much",
        "At first I wasn't sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn't weigh down on the phone's processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go."

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update."

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Please give us the option to disable Auto Target Tracking in settings.  The auto tracking can cause you to fire at ships your not wanting to target, especially if there lined up side by side. And cause your shots to fall way short or too far if the enemy ship is coming straight towards you. If love to have the ability to disable this feature in the settings."

        "Hi! I have been playing bloons td ever since the 1st one came out and I'm still playing btd5 today. I can't wait for btd6 and btd adventure later this year! Also. One suggestion, I feel like a lot of long time players including myself would be much more likely to participate in the random events on maps if they were also doable on mastery mode. Thank You! I look forward to more big things from Ninja Kiwi!",
        "Works good on my Sony Xperia XZs. Only problem is if I'm doing an impoppable track and I'm using Monkey Engineers. On those few levels where a mass of regeneration bloons come in, the game lags like hell. My workaround for that has been to be lame and just get sun gods",
        "Bloons TDs have always been a favorite of mine. But I'm only giving 3 stars because of a technical issue that's mind boggling. I'm on a galaxy note 8, and I start to experience game halting slowdown on level 79. I had played this game on my note 4, and could easily double that before the hardware struggled. Please please fix it",
        "I love this game. It works great on my phone.  My only problem is that I had to reinstall it and I don't know how to get everything back. If you could help that would be great. Also to be totally honest, I'm pretty sure I didn't save it to the cloud or my Facebook account.",
        "Extemely good game for pretty much any age or level of play. Easy to get into and there's enough depth of game that it will take a lot of playing to get bored. Also works well on any platform - I have it on my ipad and Samsung phone. :)",
        "I love this game only problem is I broke my phone and had to get a new one. Trying to figure out how to get everything back. I have purchased alot of things. $31000 and now only have $100. Logged in with my Facebook account still nothing. Help!!!! Please so I can get back to enjoying this game!"

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog.",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it."

        "Great idle game that you can play as much or as little as you want, even if you only have a few minutes. My only gripe is all the inactive guilds. Finding a guild with an active guild master is virtually impossible, and when the gm quits all guild upgrading is over. It's also frustrating that all the upgrades you earn for a guild stay with the guild so if your guild master comes back after 6 months and kicks you, you get to start from scratch with no bonuses.",

        "I am not able to access the members list after the upgrade, please fix this problem. I have too many inactive players I have to kick out. Kindly fix this asap",
        "great game, but one of the advertisements with a game in it caused my game to crash, and now i get nothing from watching the advertisements, I'd suppose because its still waiting for a reply from the advert. it was a casino advertisement with 3 buttons, and it led me to the top one. other than that, the app is good. definitely didn't expect an attack from the tribe of stretchy nipples.",

I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",
        "One of the dumbest cod ripoff i have seen and played in 2k18 so far. You need 20 bullets to kill someone with head shot. Dont waste your time with this dumb game. Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

        "This game is awesome. Love the graphics, sounds, and games. Makes me smile everytime Ellen talks. Silly I know but I absolutely love Ellen and this game is amazing. My 3yo son loves taking turns with mommy and we absolutely love the bonus games! He laughs and gets excited everytime we win!!! I wish I could give it a million stars!!!! HEY ELLEN MAKE A KIDS LEARNING GAME TOO PLEASE!!!! but seriously this game is relaxing and fun! If you haven't downloaded it yet, DO IT!!!!! ♡♡♡",
        "Love the game. It's fun and interactive but have only hit bonuses and free spins on the first game. Been playing for awhile now and not once did I hit the Wheel of Riches or What's in the box. It's bit deceiving that you have to increase your bet to activate the Wheel of Riches or What's in the Box when it rarely or never hits. At least allow those to hit once every thousand spins or something.",
        "My mom loved you so much. She passed away Dec. 18th. She would've loved this game you have. I play in honor of her memory and well, i love you to. Been a fan since before your johnny carson appearance. Wish i could go to your show and play a game for the fun of it and to meet you. Sincerely, Tim Simpson",
        "Ellen, love the candles that light up to spell your name. Clever. The reels in your games are Hurkey jerkey. Smooth is better. Solo, where is the box in What's in the Box? Where is the reel in wheel to riches? Your pay outs are much better on max bet. Took me a while to get to 100M. Keep up the creative good work.",
        "I keep watching the ads to get extra coins and none of them get awarded. I never get the wheel of riches or multijackpots or what's in the box no matter how high I play. I've played SO MANY times on the #Imatellen one and the heart emoji is as big as it gets but I've never gotten the bonus game. These glitches are ridiculously frustrating. Honestly if they don't get fixed soon I'm just gonna delete and find a different casino app.",
        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !"

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

        "I'm so addicted to this game! Out of all the simulation games I've played this is by far my favourite. The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don't have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it's worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.",
        "I LOVE this game, and everything about it is awesome, aside from the fact that I just got a new phone and now the time is correct on it (my old phone clock was an hour off), and daylight savings time just happened so while my new phone time is an hour later, my game won't let me play due to the time change. It says I need to go back to my previous time zone (which I haven't moved anywhere, its just daylight savings time). I've already put a suggestion up on your site asking about whether you guys can put an option to change the time on the game for these very situations, or to install a daylight savings time option so it can keep up with real time. Other than that though, I absolutely love the game, the graphics, the game play, and the characters to which I get so attached to, are stunning and beautiful. Y'all should be really proud of yourselves &lt;3",
        "Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it's a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won't be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)",
        "Loved it overall but make the chats last longer without having to reset them as I miss them with school or sleep. Not everyone can use the app at certain times in the day. It doesn't have to last the whole day just a few more hours  or 10. The games good other than that though. It's a good way to pass the time and has a good story.Keep up the good work.",
        "Im in love wih the characters already! Though, its kinda sad that you are forced to be a girl character even if you state that you arent in game. That kinda took me out of the experience a bit. I understand it would probably take a lot of effort to put that option in, but man would it be cool. Keep up the great work!",
        "I've been a long term fan now since 2016 when it came out and I still play it to this day! The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to! I have been in love with Saeran since the Common Route so him getting his own route was like a dream come true! Although, his route is an emotional roller coaster.."

        "I love this game one of my biggest issues though as it has a tendency to overheat your tablet or your phone. If it overheats too much then it will start shutting down the game and then can cause issues. I've had where my tablet has gotten the black screen of death and I'm having trouble using it directly in correlation to playing this game because of it overheating. This is something I think really needs to be looked into and see how they can maybe not use so much memory that it affects your tablet or your phone to the point of overheating",
        "Still loves the game when I play. However, I don't understands why the bonus games keep disappearing after I play one round. I have to back out off the app and then restart for the next levels to show up. Pain in the butt. Because this has continued to happen I find myself playing less and less",
        "Early levels are fun and make use of some skill. Obviously this style of game has luck involved, but later it is all luck and willingness to use paid items, as there will be 1-2 available matches on the board at a time and you just need to hope one of them will bring you closer to the win condition. They rarely do. I've had maps where the available moves are so few it  had to reshuffle after EVERY MATCH. Sometimes more than once, while it the condition was to make matches in specific locations. Complete luck.  I'd rate lower, but I did have some fun in earlier parts of the game and paid items can technically be earned occasionally. Needing to rely on them however has broken this for me, as otherwise it just feels like work in a button pressing factory.",
        "I have this installed on a newer tablet and have played it for a year and now I can't get it to work.  I also play this on an older tablet that I have been playing for 5 years and plays very well but when I play Elsa creations it does not calculate all that I have matched whether it be one or three.  This part needs to be fixed.  I have watched it not tally what I have matched.  No way to win when it does not work right! I am adding to this post because now frozen free fall does not work at all!  Not sure what happened.  I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it and nothing.  So everything I have played on this game is gone!!",
        "I love this game but its gotten very buggy in the last week. Screens go blank, restarts when making level selection many times over, errored out when buying snowballs, and extra challenged randomly appear and disappear so that the \"days left\" has no meaning. Someone needs to look at this.",
        "Great game that I've been playing for years now, however with the new updates, I can't play past level 1310 because the game freezes as soon as I run out of moves and it tries to reshuffle...and just this morning I can't even play a level without the game restarting over and over again! I can play all the extra bonus games with no issue, it's the regular levels that I can't play...please fix this!"

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update."

        "I do like the game because it is fun.  The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is challenging; however, the new update includes an option to purchase updates to units by way of credits, alloy, and crystals.  The wording is not specific and I wasted quite a bit of crystals, credits and alloy and did not receive what I thought I purchased.  Although I am unhappy and will most likely NOT make any further purchases in this game in the future, it is still worth a try.  Just make sure you do not make the same mistake I did.  I do hope the developer reads this and makes the appropriate chsnges.  Enjoy.",
        "Loved it to begin with and spent a lot of actual money to progress...... but it only helped a little, you have to have deep pockets or too much time to get anywhere. Oh and now it's crashed, having to re install just to see if I've lost all my money!",
        "I gave 2 stars.  I used to like this game but not anymore. I am lvl 7 and the only people who ever hit me are lvl 10 bases!!! What is up with that? Don't give me some bs excuse is because regardless, this is not right and I am thinking of quitting because of this.  I'm a paying customer but I won't be spending another dime on this lopsided game.  Thanks for stealing my cash and my time.",
        "Would definitely give at least 4 stars, but there's one thing that really makes me mad: The Attacking/Defending Algorithm. Out my entire squad, I have the least attacks, but I'm the leader, by far, in defenses. I don't WANT to attack anyone yet. I want to farm and get stronger. But I can't do that if I'm getting attacked 7-10 times every hour. Even when I win defenses, I still lose resources. Fix that. Make it to where people that rarely attack, are rarely attacked.",
        "this game used to be good but they have ruined the opponents. being a level 9 on all  units costs more to build to attack than the resources you can scavenge from your opponents. also the developers are allowing hundreds of absolutely identical bases to be produced so even if you decline an attack and are repaired you get matched to a different 'player' but with the same base. it's a disgrace.",
        "The new event challenge is great but the number of times the game crashes now is unbelievable. To make it worse it only seems to crash when I'm almost getting a 3 star win so I then end up with a loss and lose any troops which take ages to rebuild. Please fix it."

        "💖LOVE THIS GAME!  BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING GRAPHICS on each level. Continues to the next story line and game level without any ads. Only issue it keeps freezing up on me as a new player to this game. I hope I don't have to uninstall it as  its the best came I've come across that I have truely enjoyed. To many games on Google play with kiddie themes. This one is just what I've been looking for. I 💖💖💖💖 it. But if it keeps freezing up I'll have no choice but to uninstall it. How sad that would be.",
        "Game is not fun at all. You spend too much time looking for stuff that it won't give you, not to mention that you need to match 5 gems to get any kind of special gem unlike other match 3 games where you get a special gem when you match 4 or more gems. If they change that I will be willing to give it another try. But until then I'm uninstalling the game and won't reinstall again.",
        "I wasn't expecting to like this game but I started it 3 hours ago and I'm still playing so it must have something good about it or I wouldn't still be here. I'm more of a play a few min and move on. It has pretty graphics, and nice story line.",
        "I love this game! The graphics are awesome and the games themselves are difficult but winnable. Just don't plan on playing through it very rapidly. The only complaint I have is that the story line is disjointed and sometimes difficult to keep track of. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes match 3 games.",
        "Great game, nice to play. But too many instructions to play makes this game BORED. Waste a lot of time. Sorry to say, I just uninstall.",
        "It is ok and worth a download. I am at level 36. The first 10 levels took two hours, then it got hard to make progress.  This is greedware requiring many $100s to play very long. The initial game plays over an hour, then becomes tedious and time-consuming. It is fine to play when on the toilet in the morning, and that seems appropriate. Mostly, this is just another match three game with excellent graphics and a modest story. Skip all the side games, those just waste resources prompting you to buy time or resources for real cash.  Never waste jewels to keep playing as there are unlimited replays only requiring you to wait for more energy to slowly but for free to build up for the next day's 15 minutes of play. The rewards for playing daily go at least for a year, so it takes a long time to finish."

        "Addictive and  overall  good game but could be improved. Anyone that's played for a number of years will agree that changes in the last year are ruining the game. The events pretty much every month now are ridiculous.  The instant builds & gold abuse are out of hand. Used to be a game of skill, a level playing field in regards to age, background & financial means, where players skill level & strategy were tested on the battlefield, now it's become a pay to win game where teams are assembled based on how much they will spend to win. For all the $$ Inno is making off gold purchases, they fail to invest back into the game experience for a smooth running game. Example, the game will freeze up on a player being op'd and they are not able to effectively defend. This issue has been brought up many times to Inno & has yet to be corrected. Players know the glitch & many exploit it, again making for an unfair playing field. Many long time & loyal players are choosing to leave the game after finishing up current, active world's due to changes in the last year or so. For new players, it's a fun & addictive game in which you have the opportunity to meet & play with people from all over the world, but be advised the description is misleading, it's not a free game & based on skill as it once was. If you want to win, be prepared that you will need to spend a great deal in the newer version pay to win it's become.",

When swiping it doesn't always read the swipe and kick it for a try through ball. When shooting the swipe isn't constant, I can swipe as fast as i can and it goes 54mph. Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue. Atm the game isn't going to be played much more because it gets frustrating when it isn't working right.",

        "Easy to pick up and varied game play.  Some of the controls can be a little repetitive but not to the point of distraction.  Keeps you interested and doesn't require a great expenditure of cash if you are a relatively casual player.  Plenty of good themed events.  All in all a good distraction which I have now been playing for almost a year !",
        "I have been enjoying this game very much since I installed it maybe about a month ago. I actually stopped participating in a game that I've been in for 3 years for I find the is more entertaining, better graphics, quick response time on tickets and the community is more open. Highly recommend this game; which I might add is for all ages and gender who enjoy space battles and strategy. Thanks eh",
        "Love this game. it would be nice to know what kind of equipment you are going up against in war like you see when you are in pursuit mode i.e. DT, CR, MS, BS and what kind of weapons and defense. Thanks for the great game",
        "Great game with a large degree of strategy. Unfortunately, recent changes make it very difficult to obtain good heroes without P2P. This is most likely going to erode the free to play player base resulting in a game that is not as fun to play. Hopefully this can be rectified in future updates.",
        "Ooh dear ooh dear how sad,, yes that directed to you again astro-(I've run out of ideas an getting desperate now)-nest.  Just had a login gift (cue fanfare) which was 2 pointless training id's.. Big bloody Whoop. Oh an let's not forget the equally pointless (get your hands in your pockets/debit/credit card rip-off) St Patricks day event. Cue no crystal/AP boosters.. Seriously you jokers should all have stripey shirts on with a little printed card with numbers on attached.. What's truly sad is the games good, possibly even great.. But! Greed as always outweighs the gamers creed.. FYI! I don't expect a reply.. Your preprogrammed bots don't know how to deal with genuine critism, nor do you care either",
        "A very amusing game. It has its flaws, but so do you! :-)  At least give it a try, you won't be dissapointed."

Why can't there be a OK option there as well? But, overall excellent game!",

Great for a bit but really lags on... speed it up please",

Keep playing the same level over and over until you can upgrade, play another level, then proceed to keep playing the same level again. The competitive mode is also messed up as the opponent gets scores near impossible",
        "Everything is great and good but only have one problem. And this problem will killing you all. That's the loading is damn slow no matter you are in LTE network or wifi situation. Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",
        "Even with a perfect LTE speed game struggled with downloading hunts. The game forces you to do certain hunts before you can go back to the ones you like and want to finish. Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",
        "Awsome game, the only thing wrong with it is that it takes forever to load. The graphics are amazing and so is the gameplay. This is something that could keep me entertained all day and I wouldn't get bored.😺👌",
        "The game currently wont open, when it does its constantly crashing and force stopping. I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",
        "During cts theres moments get sudden lag and it throws off the shooting causing to miss when i know aiming right. It never had these lag bits before."

        "This game is awesome. The girls are beautiful and the songs are nice. There are a couple of errors I be having with the game though. I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won't get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved",
        "I like music game in general, it's hard to get the game right on mobile. but they manage to get it right here. The LP system prevent you to play continuesly unless you paid. But in my experience the amount is decent enough (this make you enjoy the music more since you dont have to restart to achieve perfection). The card mechanic is added bonus where you can spend hard earn cash. I can see people still enjoying the game without spending anything.",
        "Warning! This game is freakin' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging. The circle disappear sometimes during the live show. Sometimes the app even doesn't recognize my finger touch that makes me miss a circle. But overall. It's a good game  .... ALL HAIL PRINTEMPS AND GUILTY KISS",
        "I love the game definitely but with the new update, it keeps telling me that there's a transmission error then when it went through and finished connecting, it said that the data transfer was successful. I haven't transfered anything to a new device or anything like that. The only options I'm given is to contact support and start a new game in which I definitely don't want to do. It isn't my connection because everything else on my phone that requires WiFi is fine and I can use it. Is this because of the new update?",
        "I love the game and it's wonderful!!  But...  I had i don't know like a glitch or something.  When started to play the rhythm game while I playing suddenly the icon that I should press came faster all or a sudden. But the song is still OK.  After the glitch it becames back to normal.  This happen me for 3 times on the same day. Please fix it. And Thank you.",
        "It's so addicting and a fabulous rhythm game. One thing I'm really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don't do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don't know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls."

And I have a pic saved of my pocket pair.   Last time I checked it is impossible to be dealt two of the same card.   And in what world does a three of a kind lose to two pair.   Will never spend money on this app again!!!!!!!    So glad to receive a generic response...   It would have been nice if you actually read the review.  It doesn't matter how lucky you are. You cannot get get 2 of the exact same card dealt in the same hand.  And no matter how lucky you are 3 of a kind shouldn't be losing to two pair.  That just the rules of poker.",

        "This is an updated version. My last post was from I think September or maybe October, but this game is truly AMAZING!!! The story line itself is great as well as the side story's that you can read as well. This game has changed so much from when I started playing this game in August. The events are great but I think the developers can give a little bit better rewards then just XP juice and more jewels as well as heart stamina, but other than that the game is perfect no glitches and non of that stuff. The one year anniversary was amazing thank you for that!! I can't wait for season 10 and the future seasons of Moe Ninja Girls!!!",
        "There really isn't anything negative to say about \"Moe! Ninja Girls\" the story is great, every character is deep and likeable, even if you're a free player each chapter is long enough to keep you coming back and paying is definitely worth it,too. It looks great and sounds great to boot. I honestly don't like mobile games at all but this is amazing and would be even it were a console or pc game. To me this is THE perfect app on mobile so download it now! And devs: I hope you continue to support the game because if you guys keep making seasons,I'll keep playing. Love you guys! &lt;3",
        "The story is really the best part of the whole game. The ninja fighting seems to be arbitrary , as you can have high stats and still lose a match. Collecting new gear is fun but you don't get as much new gear as you would like. Sometimes the game stretches the abilities of my Amazon fire eight and crashes under Google Play add in. This story definitely makes it worthwhile playing though it's funny and titillating!  ;-)",
        "Amazing story! Great characters. Other similar apps dont compare. Im playing completely free so far, just finished Season 1, and many awesome event stories. Well worth my time. Yes you have to wait 4 hours between chapters, but who cares. Its actually a nice pace.",
        "Cute anime girls. Only things is that the gameplay was really simple. I've played some dating games before and usually there's more options or they appear more frequently. And the ninja fight mini game was also simple. I don't know. This game seems to get good reviews so maybe it's just me.",
        "The game's quite sensational! You wouldn't believe how hooked I am to this game when I finally found it then played it. The story is quite good, the cast are very unique. All in all, a great game. Oh, it would be nice to add some mini-games that allow players to gain nineys/gems other than the ninja fights. Also, there were some hick-ups with some of the dialogues where the words don't make sense but it's still readable."

The one above the have supplied to Google bounced back.  The one they advertise in game gets ignored. Take your money oh yes they sure WILL given the daily but this offers. NO SUPPORT REPORTING TO GOOGLE as support email is fake.",
        "This game is wildly disproportionate.... There are players who spend thousands of dollars on in-app purchases and have insane amounts of power so they pick on the players who can't afford to do the same. The amount of resources required to upgrade technology and buildings becomes astronomical very quickly and mining for the resources needed is impossible due to the fact that the huge players hunt mines. Adding to this, every time your fleet gets hit on a mine or a base you lose 20% of that fleet, which costs you more resources to build it back up, compounding the impossibility to grow unless you spend insane amounts of money. If you don't have ridiculous amounts of money to waste on this game, don't bother downloading it.",

Then when you complain, he purposely delays any response for 48 hours because that takes you outside of the Google Play store Return Policy...thus forcing you to either continue to not be responded to OR contest the entire transaction as fraud through your bank.

        "Over engineered upgrades which are clearly done as a gold mine for DroidHen. Result is you either pay to win or massive grind. Defender II was more balenced in this regard but still a huge grind too. I think World Raid is a myth since it has never worked. It apperently lasts about 30 second but I don't know since it mostly throws an error. I've gotten in twice and it immediately goes to Stage Cleared with &gt;97% beast life left.",
        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

Please change the times back or I may delete what was a better game before the update.  Thank you",

        "Nice game, im still playing but it should be an easier way (for ppl that dont want to spend real life money on these games) to get diamonds. Cost for outfits/shoes/jewlery are extremely high 189 diamonds for a dress i mean come on. Only can watch one video to earn 1 diamond thats disappointing. I'll give 5 stars if getting diamonds gets easier or mini games to get diamonds would be great.",
        "I Love this game but recently it has disappointed me. To move on to the next task I have to buy an expensive house which I can't afford (Hollywood mansion). I can't even buy the coins to afford it because the coins are so expensive too. There is no way of getting around it, I have tried making movies and moving up levels but I am always stuck with the same problem. I can't even skip the task! I am on the verge of rage quitting this game.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played. This must be the world's NO. 1 game. Please make lessen the amount of money that you have for the London Mansion. Please add more stories as I have finished all the stories (except the London Mansion). The last thing is that this game should have more updates as in my IPad there is a new version of this game. Thank you.",
        "I really do love it, but 95% of the clothing requires a ton of diamonds that are very rare and difficult to earn but when you do receive them you only get a couple. Also, it's very frustrating that searching for random objects consumes your energy. Please, PLEASE fix those.",
        "I would give it 5 steers but every time I try to go into a Beverly hills store my game crashes and I have to close the game and I try again and it keeps happening also the losing is slow. If you fix this I will give it 5. Thanks.",
        "This game is toooo Goooooood. But the dresses are very costly, no new hair styles, in spin wheel i never got 500 or 1000 diamonds, also i want to have this character a baby. Please reduce the prize of the dressed. Also London is nothing in front of a Hollywood mansion"

        "Nice game but with lot restrictions. You can not send firefighter to take hose if nothing burn - yet or to take wrench if car is still in river. Game allows for max four missions in queue and often some of them not resolvable, as you dont have needed units yet. And you can create an alliance and recruit members but you can not evict them at all. Once your ally is full, the only way to make free space is to leave it.",
        "Nice game and I very happy to play this game. Please decrease new missions time. Add New mission with other sound like public, traffic, police siren, fire car silence, etc..",
        "It's nice game, graphic is good.  But the mission is only 4 and there nothing to upgrade at the max level of 6. Please add in more mission instead of 4, HQ can be continue upgrade and add in more unit..  The game will be perfect",
        "I play both of these games and i love them both! My only complaint with this game is the price of emeralds and the Price of the rescue chopper and the fire chopper.",
        "What are my favorite games on a PC called emergency I wish you had an availability to download units like New York police and ambulance or American Style still play it on PC",

        "This game has had me hooked for almost two years now. There is always something to work on and improve. For long time Final Fantasy fans, this is the ultimate fanservice. I found this game to be more nostalgic than even other Final Fantasy crossover games like Dissidia and Theatrhythm. My only gripe is that I wish there was some sort of non-battle exploration aspect. A chance to explore the 3d FF games in 2d, even if they were brief and not the whole worlds, would be a nice touch. Highly recommended if you're looking for an addictive combat-focused rpg to devote yourself to, and super recommended for Final Fantasy fans.",
        "Some minor technical issues with hanging or loading forever screens... but overall superb job with the idea, and best part is not needing to gatcha for your fave ff characters. Prob the least p2win of the top mobile games out there",
        "I would rate it a 5, but the problem is that after the 6/8 update, the game ended up being super slow.  Extremely slow that I had to set my battle speed to 1 just to perform a blatant laggy action.  If you fix this issue, then I'll be happy to re-rate it a 5, but for now, you deserve a 3 unless you resolve it.",
        "A fun game that makes you think about playing other Final Fantasy games. I have become invested in various characters and I am interested in Ffiv. The sprites do not work for all characters as it is hard to see differences between characters such as Vayne and Larsa. The game has missed an opportunity to create a storyline to bring the various games together. However it is a fun game that makes you want to play the full range of the Final Fantasy franchise.",
        "I can't remain as positive as I used to be towards the game. With the various app issues such as excessively long loading times, poor performance, and issues with in-app purchases, I have soured on the game as a whole. The lack of daily missions that the japan side of the game received with the FF3 Onion Knight event that we still haven't received reeks of greed and deprives us of about 100 mythril (the in game currency) compared to where we should be.   The game itself, when it runs properly is still excellent. And it is awesome to use your favorite Final Fantasy characters, or become new fans of some. But DeNA has treated the Global version of the game as an afterthought as of late.",
        "I gave this game 5 stars on EVERYTHING! But... I have some criticism. Some of the dungeons are completely too difficult. I've been playing the game for 2 years now DIEHARD and i still can't get even close to beating some of the bosses."

There are hundreds of issues that don't get addressed they just add more and more content hope people ignore the issues. Thed new content creates new issues and in some cases makes old issues worse",
        "Don't bother. Pay players only do well. And it's expensive! Devs have it programmed for pay players so you fall far behind and can't catch up. They match you against pay players that are always stronger. Contests are extremely difficult. Been playing for 2 years so I know what I'm commenting about.",
        "Ever since the new owners took over, content has lessened. Although new heroes appear, it is all about money scams and contests. Turned down drop rates make it nearly impossible to upgrade with dropping piles of cash.",
        "Used to be a fun game with silly characters and lots to do. Since sold by per blue game quality has plummeted. Deleted and moved on to other games that run smoother and appreciate customer feedback.",

        "One of my accounts was stolen, I had it connected to FB, Google & Email, I have gotten an email asking for things they need to verify, I sent what I could, name, server, etc, I also sent pics of the name it was when I had it and the name they changed it to, also the guild name, still not heard a thing back? It can't be that hard to get it back, I known a few ppl working in the gaming area, and they say it's pretty easy that you guys probably could care less, as long as you get your money...I really like playing it, I've put money into it, but security is horrible if I can have it connected to 3 things, yet someone can still steal it???.....Very disappointed now."

        "5 min for 1 bar of energy is too long to wait. Loose interest.. when you level up the energy bar stays the same. It doesn't refill or increase.  Which also annoying as takes too long to complete timed tasks.  Frustrating as hell as decent game but as states above is a disappointment. Improve on these factors and you have a decent game until then there's no point in playing as everything is LONG and boring",
        "I love that this game features the cast of Desperate Housewives - they look so similar and it makes me remember what their voices on the show are like. I think it's great that the game can be played Offline and how there is a storyline with mystery involved. I've played most of the game and just play the new episodes as they come. 4 Stars!",
        "I don't understand why you don't get a refill of energy when you level up. It takes so long as it is to full up.... give us a freebie when we hit a milestone!",
        "Its ok...a bit. The concept is interesting. But the game is getting too monotonous. .. and also do something about the energy refill.  It takes too long. Overally its an ok game but there is room for improvement.",
        "Y'all need to hurry up !! I already completed Chapter 14. Like what are y'all waiting on ?! Don't make a game so damn addicting and have people waiting to see what's next. Get a move on. Until then you only get 3 stars.",
        "Only issue is you have to wait so long for energy..  Only get to play for a few minutes..  Then wait on energy!  Would be willing to pay for it for a better deal :) but still gets a 5 star!!"

Would be obvious but most have 10 alternate accounts making it harder to see how dead it has become. The select army function has been broke for months even tho they have updated to make map look like snow and buildings animate faster. Pointless... Lag is even worse and now impossible to do anything when attacked you have to exit game and reload to hopefully have anything left. Theres been multiple hacks making armys instant return to there death. Nothing waz done to fix it. Very expensive packages are rigged to only give one commander but imply that you recieve the 32 needed to complete one. Experimentals fail even at 110% chance success. The players are great community and support slightly improved. It is a very complex game with many things to keep u busy forever.

        "I was having so much fun with this app today after the updated it on my S3 Galaxy tablet! Seriously!! This is dope! I can't wait to level up my grade from 3 & move forward to grade 5! When I watched the ATIS video tutorial,  I was blown away! It seems that \"Expert Server\" is becoming much more awesome with their new feature added in the server!! I really can't wait to get there! This is awesome update FDS!  Great job!  Keep it up! 😊😎👍👍👌👌🙌🙌",
        "This is truly a step up over your average plane simulation games. With Global release and many changes that have taken place it truly is the best out there.  My only gripe is that there is not enough focus on African Airlines. The new update has totally been focused on American and European Airlines. Most African airlines already have aircraft listed in Infinite Flight but yet aren't added. Sad really, hence the 4 stars",
        "Its good to hear that ur asking for our feedback. First of all let me tell that u guys are doing a superb job...keep it up and lots of love to u all who developed this simulator. One request to the admins that atleast reply to what we are asking, not exactly at the same time but take ur time and reply.. previously i had asked about adding liveries to 777 300 er model no one replied or even acknowledged that ur reply has been received. I hope to get a reply here atleast.  I would like to know when u will add A350 and more liveries in 777-300er model ( would love to see air india, jet airways, china southern, china eastern, jal, ana, korean air, alitalia).. please add this liveries.. it will be awesome",

        "Played this game since the beginning, one of the biggest updates has only been made to those who have to pay an extortionate amount.  Feel robbed really and the fact I can't play the game offline, seriously? ffs what a waste.",
        "Well this is a bit atrocious. I feel entirely missold, was shown this app with the ability to fly pretty much from and to anywhere on the planet. I even had it on a previous phone and did such. Now I buy it and oh guess what? It was updated so one can't fly from one city to another, let alone another country. I mean it's pretty pointless at this point, don't think I can justify the additional £75 (per year) to enable me to actually use this and salvage some fun out of it -_-   Tl;Dr? I almost want my £5 back bc it was used for about 5 minutes - may as well build paper planes as they go further."

        "Seemed great then I realised that the 'beta' has been non progressive forever, the updates only include small pirate gathering and fleet adjustment,  never the main things like resource sharing and reinforcement which are the big things people actually want aswell as convenient random fleet losses that either you get no reports for or none of your ships are saved by the warp which is purely for that purpose.  Play by all means but don't expect to advance unless your pockets are deep.",

        "I absolutely LOVE this game!! The stories of each character are amazing! I just wish they had more suitors. And I wish they made more games exactly like this but with a completely new story line and characters. Like, I love the voice animations and how long the chapters are and how long the story line of each person is. I also love how your character talks like a modern day girl when she's at the sengoku era. You don't have to pay to see more about each person either. It's amazing. I Love this app. Please make more!!!! ❤️❤️❤️",
        "So, this is my third update. That's how much I love this game 😂. Thank you for giving us castle and closet space via game events. Very helpful. I don't have anymore lag issues. And I appreciate the diversity in storylines. No route is the same, unlike other Otome games. Also, the relationship development is fantastic - not too slow or fast. The main character actually talks like a real person and less like a \"character\". Art is beautiful, too. I just feel bad that I can't say much about the music or voice acting, as I usually have my phone on vibrate.",
        "Idk what to say, but one thing for sure I really loveee this game!!!! Is so awesome, the chara omg so magnificent. I don't mind spending much money on this game hahaha it's so freaking beautiful!!! And I really love the MC she's so strong and cute, it's just like I want to have a route for MC too. But rn I'm waiting for KENSHIN UESUGI route, I hope it will come out soon. Damn, Cybird always make such a beautiful otome game. Thank you for making this game, it just made my life💗💗💗💗",
        "I couldn't resist to do a newer version of the review, so here it is. I've been playing this game for nearly three months now, and that's saying something. First of all, the story is really engaging. The characters are really sweet, and I love how we don't need to spend money to enjoy it, unlike other otome games. Shout-out to the people who made Ieyasu's route a dream come true.",
        "There are only a few routes out currently but they are wonderful all the same. The main character is funny and reacts realistically to situations! Not to mention the voice acting is impeccable like wow I don't speak a word of Japanese but everytime Nobunaga speaks I'm just nodding along. Also this game has an adorable animated series and it is the best",
        "The most romantic and sweetest experience of falling in love game..  I feel like I'm truly falling in love with Masamune date.. Love his playful side, his sweetness,  fierce yet gentle  sometimes.. The only reason I CANNOT RATE 5 STAR is I cant read back the route chosen even though I have spent actual money..  Its like I'm purchasing the story,  but the fact is,  I'm not.. This is frustrating..  Atleast after having spending so much money,  we can keep the story to be read again afterwards..  Please reconsider this..  Thank you"

Performance is the worst is all i can say. Not strictly pay to win but almost still fun while free and has been for years. I just hope it works decently on your device as performance has just gotten worse over the years on my dozens of devices. They stopped caring about the game and set their sights on money instead kinda sad",

He/she denied me, refused to take liability, even though I can prove it all. At first I didn't want my money back, I wanted my account back. It hurts me to say you refused to help a spending player. You guys basically stole my accounts and my money.",

I wish therr was a way to go back and do the tutorial again and I accidently pressed during the first one and missed how to land. Lots of trial and error on that one. Also would be nice to know how the scoring exactly works.",

Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "By level 4 no matter what score i get the bots always get about 15 higher. 1 game i would get 130 and the bots would get 145. Then when i get 160 they still get 175 showing this is rigged. That makes it so annoying with a lack of help from the developers make it annoying otherwise would b 5 stars if these issues were fixed",
        "The game has a great Idea to it, but it really needs so tweaking in the physics deparment of the game, on certain Stages I go further with a Bad Jump then a Excellent one, and the wind doesnt really play that much of an effect in the game. But overall great and fun game, amd very addictive.",
        "This game is actually very good, I play a lot of mobile games as its normally all I have time for and this is challenging and fun, the career mode is good and also like the upgrades..  I will definitely be keeping this one on my phone for a while because it is a really cool game. If you don't like ads then click you back button to get rid of it from time wasting or spend the buck to lose them forever.. Well done on a cool game, make some more like it!!"

        "I'm so addicted to this game! Out of all the simulation games I've played this is by far my favourite. The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don't have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it's worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.",
        "Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it's a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won't be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)",
        "Loved it overall but make the chats last longer without having to reset them as I miss them with school or sleep. Not everyone can use the app at certain times in the day. It doesn't have to last the whole day just a few more hours  or 10. The games good other than that though. It's a good way to pass the time and has a good story.Keep up the good work.",
        "Im in love wih the characters already! Though, its kinda sad that you are forced to be a girl character even if you state that you arent in game. That kinda took me out of the experience a bit. I understand it would probably take a lot of effort to put that option in, but man would it be cool. Keep up the great work!",
        "I've been a long term fan now since 2016 when it came out and I still play it to this day! The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to! I have been in love with Saeran since the Common Route so him getting his own route was like a dream come true! Although, his route is an emotional roller coaster..",
        "Update: I said that I only rated 4 stars because sometimes I missed the chat room because I didn't get any notification, right? But now, after I updated the game I get notifications about the chat, and not just once but twice! I got double notifications lol I'm so happy, thank you! And thanks for the 20 hourglasses after the update. Now I give you full 5 stars! I LOVE this game! 😘  I'd love to give 5 stars, I mean this game is amazing and almost perfect! Just sad that sometimes I missed the chat because I didn't get the notification. So, I have to check the game often. But I really enjoy playing this game, which doesn't feel like game at all. I feel like I'm chatting and talking with real people! And it says something, cause I just installed this yesterday. Highly recommended! Try it and you'll love it!"

        "It's a fun game but pvp is a big part and can take a week building up an army just to have it crushed when you log on. Has caused me to not play for a day or two because of this but also what makes me come back it offers that challenge that is often lost in most games like this where is the fun of there is no risk. Not to many tedious tasks after about day 5 no longer logging in every 3 hours to start a build project or something.",
        "Other people might think its a boring game, but this game really fits for someone who doesnt want to get stressed out in a game.. really love the concept. Been a player here for almost 6 years now.. tried other games but still going back to this game.",
        "Should add a few features like: 1. Able to share your battle report with other players. 2. Cancel troops in training. 3.See incoming attack on Hamlets you're holding (Or add a lost art which helps to see it).",
        "My most resource hungry app on the tablet. Need to buy too many stuff to be a top level player. Lately, more stuff to buy and twice as expensive. Don't recommend this game.",
        "Complex empire builder, takes time to learn. Definitely a pay to win. Lots of people with alts and coin hacks. Still lots to do. It's fun, but not worthy of serious commitment.",
        "Reviving soldiers for sapphires must be the most ridiculous idea of all. My handful of soldiers need 2000 of those that are already impossible to acquire. :("

        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?"

        "I was writing about an issue today, and with next time I have looked to see if the issue is resolved, it was.  Thank you for this amazing and wonderful game.  I had been playing this game for almost 4-5 years already.  With my issues being resolved I would say I love this game so much.  Much recommended.  😘",
        "I have waited 30min to see the gameplay after started the game. Very confusing.Bla bla, shiny things all arround, see this, take those, listen to the story and chose your 120lvl character. What is the point for new players to start from 120 lvl? How this can be fun?But never mind, I never understood the games which do that. Sorry, but I didnt find this game interesting for me.",
        "Wow, what do I think? I think this game is all hype took 4hrs plus change to download the game after installing it so to even play it was a joke, then when I finally was able, it froze on the log in screen and took me back out to my home page on my phone screen, only to then tell me the game had not been installed!!! Yeah clearly it is as it's taken up space! Not very good I'm not happy, I will try again before uninstalling this game if I manage to get in the game, obviously the review will change get but until then it's 1 star ass I can not go any lower. Sorry game makers!",
        "I wonder if there will be transcended busters in the future. Or perhaps the current arch buster will be the 'warrior' type and there will 1 of each type for us to mount. Looking forward to the overlord release though!",
        "Love the game been playing for over 2 1/2 years. Only one probably lately and that is my WB scores have been down substantially along with other users. I dont understand how going from a few archs' to having 6 and new gear makes my score down 14 trillion? Im bot the only one this is happening to so im a bit confused on what the problem is. Other than that great game play it everyday. Just dont like losing rewards on my wb% when it should be higher.",
        "After massive update and huge changes, I have to change my rating from 2 to 5.Such a big improvement toward all player,either f2p or whales.Congrats Gamevil, hopefully the community will grow as we see now in this game itself."

        "This game is quite good. The graphics are pretty nice for a kid's game, and I do appreciate how there are vents to win power up. That is a very nice update. It seems like Disney took the kids element a little more into consideration.  The later stages do get understandable harder. But after the 100th stage is almost impossible for kid's standerard, but I don't mind it since other games do the same thing.",
        "The game WAS great..spin the wheel, watch an ad, get a gameplay reward.  Great. But OMG now there's an BETWEEN squares AND for  rewards??!!! After you refused to give me back lost features  & said \"Disney had NO INTENTION of doing that in the future\", I had to think whether to uninstall the game, or suck it up & gimp along. Think you guys made the decision for. Too bad, I really enjoyed the game. Thx for what USED TO BE fun.",
        "This may not mean much to most. After suffering from a head injury, my memory was terrible. Level 250, memory coming back strong. I play daily on 2 devices. Just wish you could win gems, you have  to buy them except 22 in beginning. All in all 3-4 stars.",
        "I love love love this game!  BUT....THE ONLY THING I HATE IS THAT YOU CANNOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS...IVE HAD TO REINSTALL THIS GAME 3x's AND LOST ALL PROGRESS! Maybe if i wasn't on level 280 it wouldn't be an issue! You should have this as a feature by now! UGH! 😠😭",
        "Impossible to save or synchronize progress! As mentioned in many other reviews, it is not possible to save game progress, even if you link to your Facebook account. App support website confirms this functionality is simply not supported. Absolutely unbelievable. Just unbelievable. Don't waste your time on this game - it really will be _wasted_ time.",
        "This is a great game and you can have fun for hours. I'd rate it 5 stars if a few things were changed. First, you need to be able to sync on other devices, especially if connecting to Facebook. I have other games that sync, no reason why this game can't get with that technology. Just got a new phone, was at level 346, and now have to start over on new phone. Luckily old phone will still be used. Second, it's impossible to earn gems. There should be special events to earn gems. Yes, you can spin to win, but the odds aren't in your favor to earn them. Third, there should be more opportunities to earn helps. The event to pass 5 levels is extremely difficult and there aren't many other opportunities to earn helps. I'm not spending money on this game. Take tips from Farm Heroes! Overall, this is a fun game and the graphics are cute."

Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "This game should be avoided. They don't care about what the players think and refuse to make improvements or adjustment players suggest. Progress is slow and even if you spend real money your odds of getting what you want is low.  Avoid starting at a costs. It is not worth your time.",
        "It is impossible to have a good team without spending lots of money.  In order to have a good team you need 4 star level robots which even when you do get a chance to get one, you will end up with a duplicate which will be liquidated for just about nothing. Hence better players get better and lower level players stay at the bottom. Also players that spend alot tend to get better chances on draws that are supposed to be random. Wow that's a surprise",
        "This game is a lot of fun. Great time killer. The only thing I think could be improve is the fact that you can't upgrade your bots with duplicates you get in the space bridge. And possibly better mechanics to see the bots you have walking around your base. Other than that. It's amazing.",
        "Slow, VERY SLOW You have to wait for everything.  After each battle, the Autobots need 7 minutes to recover for the next battle, but I have enough fuel for battle.  And, as your robots get more stars, the more you have to wait.  So it is about 20 minutes per game for me. Slow  Then if you accidentally switch to another apps or shut the screen off for a second, you will have to wait for the game to reload for another 2 or 3 minutes.  slow  Graphics is beautiful, but story suck, and wait time is horrible",
        "Updated. Games are supposed to be fun, if u play this game be prepared for a complete lack of respect for its user Base from the devs and a lack of fun events. Even those spending 1000s are bored  Don't start spending as the game is dying Don't expect good support from the game makers either who seem to be on a mission to put off it's older users to the point of stopping them playing the game. Ps dont expect many players as a deception. Pps #saveferal",
        "First off, if you do not want duplicates, do _not_ spend any money on anything other than maybe another builder bot and don't waste any of your cyber coins on crystals until you get all of your builder bots.   So long as you don't care about getting dupes the game is fun. And you will get so very many many many dupes, often times the same bot in a row. Fortunately, the somewhat new cores help take away the pain of getting dupes.  Personally, I enjoy the strategic and alliance parts of this game a lot and the events are fun so long as you don't care about placement on the leaderboard. Having a good alliance helps a lot by the way. Don't be afraid to look around for ones that boot leaches."

Although after this gargantuan update it seems to be really laggy and I experience frame rate issues almost all the time making enjoyable and smooth gameplay impossible. This is especially annoying since I am playing on an s8 +",

        "I don't know why but m not able to connect my phone to my tv. I have motog5s plus phone n Sony smart tv. But since my tv can't download apps so I opened d website on d browser on d tv but the room no or the QR code doesn't appear no matter how long I wait. I don't know what d problem is please tell me a solution",
        "It would be a really good game if it stops letting me use my coins then when I'm in the game for not even 5 seconds. It would shut down on me and when I login back in my coins are gone. I will like you to fix that",
        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",
        "Its good but the update mess me up because i have so many song that ived by but now i dont have any of it and there s a limit by purchasing a song 2 songs per day? And what happen to the connecting with fb? What the heck",
        "I love it and all but the only thing I hate is you need coins and I need to wait for hours and cuz of that its sometimes boring and I want it to be 1000 coins like ten times a day. If this doesent happen when this year ends I'll give it a I star not II III IV or any I'll just rate it I + I'll quit and make it every minute or I'll kill this game this instant so do it NOW!!!!!!!😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😈😯😢😯😈😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😢 this makes it SUPER BORING",
        "I have the games on my Xbox, but it's so convenient to get access to ALL the songs without loading each disc.  I can play at work in a conference room during lunch with coworkers!"

This actually isn't valid as I just looked at each option to buy and none give the option of no ads. Plus I've made purchases and still nothing. I just updated the app and received the option of no ads. I clicked it and paid to no avail. Email has already been sent about it.",
        "I really love this game. I downloaded it for mindless stress relief in between classes and it has not disappointed. Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",
        "Hi there! I love this game! Im on level1839 and my hubby says i have a problem bahaha. The only thing ive noticed is the levels seem to have stopped introducing challenges and are sometimes just not possible to beat without serious coin. But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",
        "It's an ok bubble blaster game, it has a lot of pop up ads. When you beat one level and move to the next there is always a 15 sec video. If your not on WiFi this will drag at your data",
        "While its addicting its quite easy. I've gotten 3 stars on every level and I've played over 200 levels already. Ive only had to replay a level that failed 3 or 4 times.",
        "This was fun... Until level 100 when they take away the ability to switch colors of the ball you're shooting. It makes it too difficult. I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall."

Watch your hops and make sure you time your landings right. If you miss the landing you can go from holding a large lead to struggling to get up the next hill...I highly recommend this game!",
        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity."

        "It's a fantastic game, nothing less than what I'd expected. The graphics were fantastic, the story engaging, the characters well developed. However, it was too difficult to earn the in game currency. Perhaps you could add in a video where the players are able to earn gems? Even if it's only once it twice a day, I'm sure it'll definitely help. All in all though, this was a great game as usual. Keep up the good work!",
        "I've been obsessed with Sherlock Holmes since I was about 7. Every incarnation of him, be it the books, the TV show or even the anime has left me completely in awe of Sherlock.  So I'm sad to say that I feel this falls short. As it's own game, it's great. I love the story and the characters are well developed. However, I went into it with a certain idea of how Sherlock should act, and it's not what I got. I understand why though, and it's not too distracting from the game. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The puzzles were a fun mechanic (a little easy for my liking, but still enjoyable) and the art style is really pleasing. Overall, I do think it's a game worth downloading.",
        "I really love it. Just like the other \"shall we date\" games you guys made. However, twice already did i not get my free SH points after doing the required action for it. Is there anything for that? Also if you guys are into the idea, you can do a free small amount of gems for watching an advertisement once every day or something? All the rest in the games you guys make is awesome and i love em all.",
        "The best Shall We Date game by far.  The characters are funny,  especially Sherlock and I love the plots.  If you can make Sebastian,  Jack, Hercule,  Jeremy and even Lestrade's routes it would be SUPER appreciated.  Omg, I think Lestrade's route would be the funniest because ALL of them would rip and mock him.  😂  Update: I still think it's the best one.",
        "I just have to say: I love that the MC is not the usual cheerful idiot that somehow makes every guy fawn over her even though she can barely string a sentence together. This MC is portrayed as witty and intellegent as well as beautiful.  All the guys are also intellegent and quirky.  The stories are well written AND well edited. I never have trouble figuring out the plot due to poor grammar or translations.",
        "Great game, I think it's the best game shall we date had. Female lead is independent woman who doesn't make me wonder why everyone likes her. Guys are great as well, plus I absolutely the writing. It's probably the only game were I was bothered to play more than 3 routes"

Once you finished repair, you not surprisingly get attacked again. This results you in being frustrated and uninstalling or you foolishly spend your hard earned cash for resources that you will soon enough loose from being attacked.",

Only option I request is warlords events diring the weekend.  Poly and Thor are critcal resources and there never seems to be enough unless you pay for it.",

        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy.",
        "Not bad. Sometimes freezes a little during game play but usually resolved itself. The wind is usually fair for each player's turn so that's good. Overall a good little time waster game. The only thing I would suggest is to make it a little easier/more often that gold bricks get collected. I've played for over a month now and got about 8 since starting."

Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice! The creators aren't listening to the players and you may want to seriously consider before investing in this game."

        "I enjoy playing! Daily Quest could be better. (I don't get the daily magic wheel) But they have events to earn stuff. And I absolutely love my lil pets and their powers 😊 and the ingame friends I have are helpful. edited: I completed a purchase and did not recieve anything like the quest said I would. Also developers never responded to my email regarding something else. I've spent $40 bucks on this game in the 1st few days I've been playing and I think I'll keep my lil money to myself now since they haven't fixed the issue.",
        "The problem I have is you haven't given the radio toy for the bear and also you can't unfreeze the guy because you don't give out the items to do it even after defeating the monster. You still can't get enough fire logs plus still no radio toy for the bear? Plus should give more coins it is a lot in higher levels",
        "Would give 5 stars but after you get to a certain level you have to spend real money to get farther. I have spend 65 dollars on this game so far and have been scammed so many times. Its a super fun game but so hard to get anywhere. You should be able to stock up shields. Also its stupid that you have to pay to talk. I might get the VIP if some things changed.",
        "Losing some snowballs...... Would like to get more than six spins in one hour..... especially when there are large amounts needed to buy..... Mining pigs....really so much when we pay large amounts and our pay is so low.....",
        "I helped my friend defeating leonardo.i used 10 bombs .but when i attacked leonardo .there was still 1 % left .so someone else had complited it.and now i went there to claim reward there was no reward for me.i have not claimed that reward. 2nd thing you have made puzzle number 9 so much rare not even me but everyone is not getting it. Please fix this.i will give 5 stars back.",
        "Loved this game my planet gets distroyed everyday once I almost get it built. I played several times all day. Loved this game. I used to get angels but not any more. Been on same island for weeks. I love building my planet so fun. But not getting distroyed a minutes later. I've noticed alot of my friends stopped playing too due to same problem. 😥"

        "This game is so much fun. Enjoyable, challenging and addicting. However the only problem with the game is the fact that in order to play the levels, you have to collect enough tokens to unlock them. Now this is fine, if there is something else to do in the game. But there isn't. You have to wait real time in order to play anything of the game. And there is no option to watch a video to gain 10 tokens. It straight up only allows you to buy tokens with actual currency. Micro transactions can be used as long as there is a way to play the game without them. But apart from that minor flaw. I cannot recommend the game enough as it's a challenging blast. Just a shame about the tokens.",
        "A fun game overall, but there are way too many ads. You can remove ads with a micro-transaction of buying tokens or coins, but I refuse to do that as I have more coins than I need as it is. As others have noted, it would be nice if your time-replenished tokens count was more than 10, as many puzzles cost more than 10 tokens to play. You can spend coins to replay a level and get more tokens, and there is a \"super-hard\" level in the main puzzle that is actually pretty easy and awards 3 tokens.",
        "Brilliant game and the only one I have found that doesn't auto fill the 'x' as you play. Perfect. However, as you progress the chance to get tokens reduces as the cost of each level goes up which means it takes days to get enough from daily bonus to play one level.  Pay wall doesn't pay out so waste of time. Very disappointing.",
        "The game is truly fun. Can't play very long because the tokens don't regenerate fast enough. I was winning tokens on some levels but since I purchased some tokens I haven't won a single one. Now that the tokens I paid for are gone I'm still not winning tokens (only coins, but it requires tokens to open the levels) so it's back to not being able to play very long",
        "This game was great untill it became unplayable. Every level or square on the puzzle needs to be unlocked with tokens. As you go through the game all levels start costing more and more tokens. At the start around 4 tokens per lv now after 234 puzzles 16 tokens. That is total b.s. so at best I can play a single game a day. So only play if your not planning on finishing or playing them a lot of money.",
        "The cells are too small to click on without accidently pressing the surrounding squares. Also, on the Galaxt S8 with the curved screen, the edge of the playing grid goes too far over the side of the phone, making it impossible to click on any of the cells in the last column."

No explanations on some features, you have to figure it out by trial and error wasting resources. I'm at castle level 15, dragon level makes no difference so far only troop level does. Events are useless because the top spenders take everything before you can even find the location. Misleading descriptions in-game costing you resources.

        "Not bad at all! Awesome strategy game , it's all on how you decide to use your  resources (diamonds) . Don't even have to Recharge much and still move up in ranks & power. Got hooked on it more than Coc.😃😀🖒🖒",
        "You guys might want to consider making occasional, if not regular update for the game, especially on the events. At least keep up with the regular, basic ones. It was enjoyable. Missed the old days even tho so many changed drastically for good or for worst. The difficulty in everything is not really bothersome but if the minor rewards are slightly helpful, they could bring a fortune to you guys and us, players. Conclusion, please give us what we deserves 😊",
        "Great game but when i tried to use gems for instant research it didnt work and spent my gems and i tried to do it about 3 or 4 times and it spent all my gems without doing anything. I tried reopening the app and i tried resetting my phone too, to see if it was just a glitch. Please do something about this. I would like my gems back",
        "Used to be a decent game. The game developers have basically abandoned it and only use it to get cash on the side. No game updates for months. Small problems have been popping up now and then. Not worth the time, the game's just going downhill from here",
        "Too brutal and hardcore for new players. 100 times more powerfull players attack your base when you level up to lvl 6. You loose all you troops and you don't have food to develope new troops and it takes forever to get enough food and train new forces. And you are attacked again and so on. Unistalled game right after that. Alliance is no help.  They have copied whole game from the Zgirls game. Just a little different graphics",
        "Loved the game, except for the bi-weekly slaughter fest, until they stopped updating the game and stopped supporting the players. Spent money to upgrade the bank, but it keeps reverting back to level 0. Been trying to get it unlocked for weeks, but support doesn't respond. Don't waste your time and especially don't put any money into the game!"

So far I've downloaded and uninstalled seven match three games because of that issue. If it requires spending money I don't have in order to go further into the game, it too will be uninstalled and I will lower the star rating.",
        "This game is highly addictive, fun game to play!  I was on level 302 when I was cleaning out some old games and accidentally deleted Jewels Temple Quest!  To say the least I was very upset,  but I'm back on board, know what to do and am whipping through the levels!  I LOVE THIS GAME!",
        "Lost game progress and adds back after installing on new phone despite paying for removal.   Customer support email doesn't work. Still no reply here on Google Play..how does buyer protect work?",
        "Its a good simple game thats not overly involved.  But there seems to be no reason to keep score nor is there any real reason for the stars you get for each level. You can only buy hammers with gold which you only get TEN pieces per level no matter WHAT you score OR how many stars you get. And theres a lot of ads. Every time you you play a level.",
        "I love playing this game and many others. This game is easy but challenging. I do not like real hard games. I am 69 yrs.old and not as quick as I used to be. This game is good for me. Thanks.",
        "Adorable match 3. Game play seems fine. Advancing levels without glitches so far. Very addictive, so will submit a better review after some time to play. Don't like the review prompt so early in the game. Not sure yet."

        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

And you can play for a long time with what it PROVIDES---NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE ANYTHING-this is one of the better matching story/games I have discovered",

Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",
        "Love this game spent some money on it but still very fun.  They do specials on packages pretty cheap that speed things up.  Has a lot to do in it too doesnt get boring.  Good if you have a long time to play or just a couple minutes.",
        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

Upgrades cost a fortune and collecting boxes are few and far between and earning cash with off-road challenges is just a drop in the bucket of money you'll need for an upgrade. I'm not saying everything should be cheap and easy, but should increase cash values or offer other ways to earn cash.",
        "Please go back to the update before the latest one. The previous physics where perfect. Trucks moved and jumped perfectly. And the camera (free camera) followed the truck perfectly in order to see the suspension moving with the terain. Now the camera does not stay where you want it. Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics. I unistalled other games because this is all I spent time with. But now I dont know?",
        "nice! im waiting for long time for the game like this... and this is it. but, please add more common truck like nissan navara, toyota hilux vigo & revo, mitsubishi triton, ford ranger 3.2, isuzu dmax.. and also please fix the mud graphic to more realistic.. thanks..",
        "Hey devs, great game, I think a winter map or just more maps would be awesome as well as an option to sell vehicles rather than just collect them. Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",
        "This game suck because it never work it always lags out and every time it says loading trailer it goes back to my home screen. In my review i mean all of this and hope ypu make your game better so it doesn't suck but for now it does suck.",
        "This game is literally what I have been looking for. This is the perfect offroad game. I just wish that there were A LOT more maps and vehicles to chose from. It's boring to constantly go to the same maps. Also the multiplayer is pretty fun. Expand the maps and create new ones please!"

        "The game is fun to play casually. Just open it up a few times a day and level up the heroes or whatever. Now whenever I open the app, it functions the same except the graphics are glitched out. Some icons are missing completely. It is making me not want to play it as often. Wish I knew what to do to fix it. Tried reinstalling it, and that fixed it for a few hours.",
        "The game itself is fun, but there are two major bugs I ran into that ruined the gameplay:  1. Starting at zone 500, some of the idle ancients stop working entirely. Then when you reset after reaching 500, they continue to not work even at earlier waves. Incredibly disappointing.   2. When I spent 500 rubies to activate the \"double damage permanently,\" it immediately and permanently reduced my damage output 10x. Ruined all my progress and wasted my rubies.  Fix those two things and you've got yourself an excellent game.",
        "I'd give five stars except for a serious bug after about zone 130. The idea is that your heroes fight for you while your away, so you progress a bit while you're not actually playing. That's the nature of clicker games. This works as expected before zone 130, but after 130 it glitches a lot, removing a lot of your current progress.   It seems to only remember cleared zones, but not the progress within zones. For example, if I'm on zone 181 and it's moving at a rate where it looks like it would clear the zone after 20 minutes, it will reset the zone to zero if I open the app before that. Oddly, it still pays out the gold, but the progress is lost.",
        "It's really nice not too laggy at all. You get new characters all the time to help tour team and upgrade them. And it's very fun to get a boss so much gold and if your away for 2 days for example you wold come back and the monsters would keep dieing.",
        "Use to play it years ago, tryed it again now. Transcend and that Ponyboy really ruined the game I think. Progression is oversimplified and lightning fast to a point it doesn't feel fun for me at all. There is one build that is way to obvious and better then anything else.",

        "Brings Back Fond Memories I love this game! I spent countless hours playing this in the early 2000s. The controls are easy enough to understand and the text is legible on my LG V10. I don't if I'd be able to read it on a smaller screen, they are not kidding when they say this is meant for tablets. If you've got a tablet or phablet I can't recommend this game enough.",
        "A classic perfectly adapted to the phone platform This game is a MUST-have for any rpg lover. The D&D mechanics may seem i bit weird in the beginning, but you will learn in time. The replayability value of this game is almost infinite. Personally I have never played any kind of game that would allow me to play as many hours in so many different ways. The game excels in its easy to handle mechanics, fun dialogue, compelling story, great ammount of side-quests that are actually enjoyable. Hands down best Apk for this platform. Worth every penny.",
        "Great Classic CRPG BGII was definitely a breakthrough in its time, but it still holds charm and depth that many newer games can't even touch. I have this game for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and I can tell the chip set on the phone is grinding gears with the games engine. It's playable but only when the right character menu is minimized but it still gets choppy when multiple spells are being  cast. With the specs on the s7 this shouldn't be the case. Hey Developers any input/ advice on how to solve this issue?",
        "Amazing! There's a lot to love.  First, if you played the original, this is just as good with extras.  Granted, it's a bit harder to see everything, but it's what happens when you take a computer game and make it available for a phone.  Beamdog has brought additional characters, adventures, magic items, portraits and voices to the game to expand the character creation.  Some expansions are dull (like the arena unless you love grinding) but more of this rpg is on the way.  It's truly the best classic game reborn.",
        "I have a special request. I have purchased very possible version of the bg series, and have played as long as the game has existed. Call me a war vet asking for a wheel chair ramp but could you guys implement the imput of  points or the option to roll. 20+ years of rolling for stats has earnt me the option. Other than that perfect game, worth every licence for every platform. Either let us input stats with option to roll or make a shadowkeeper for android please.",
        "Game is great, as I've played it on another device. However on Note 8 it does not take up the whole screen, and the usable screen is significantly smaller than on s7 edge, and is barely playable. When I force it to full screen in settings, then touching on sides of screen are not recorded accurately. For example, when I try to resize the text box, it toggles AI instead. Makes the game virtually unpayable."

Plus they just added a new terms of service that states they aren't responsible for those problems with the game. One of those things could result in you losing all the progress on your account or the account completely.",

My Pokemon have a Miss space of 1 and somehow hit it EVERY SINGLE TIME?!?!?!?! I don't think so homie. Spinner is rigged so don't play if you actually want to be the very best there ever was because the computer will not let you.

Just to add another side of the game so the user is not doing the same thing all the time. But as is its a good game and can b won without purchases. Great job devs keep up the good work.",
        "I believe that an update of there being a free 65 horse shoes is given when the player is breeding a tier 3 or 4 horse, and that we can choose a 65 horseshoe cost for the horses in a hybrid area, and make the lady saying we need to breed a horse says to breed a horse and they give us a free 65 horseshoes and we go on from there. I hope you consider this, thanks and bye love the game!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🌌",
        "Fun, easy game. You build up your horse through training and upgrades. At a certain point you can race against other players and bet on your horse. You get to name your first horse. I wish you could name all your horses. I also wish you could race all your horses. As it is once your next tier horse is ready, the lower tier horse is done.",
        "Great game. Annoying you can't do multiple upgrades at once though. Especially seeing as they take so long to complete, n need horseshoes to speed them up, and horseshoes seem impossible to win and wayyyy expensive to buy $$$$ fix the horseshoe prices n you'd get 5 stars from me",
