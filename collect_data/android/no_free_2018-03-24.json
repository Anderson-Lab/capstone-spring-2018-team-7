        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "This game is amazing. I've only ever played on mobile since it's hard to find time to play video games. I fell in love within the first game. This mobile version is so good especially being an early release. It only takes up 205mb of storage and runs amazing even on my Honor 7x which is a great phone but is known to be not the best with higher end gaming. I'm very impressed with this game and I'll keep playing it!",
        "The devs have proved that clones can never even come close to the real stuff, this game is the BEST and it has murdered its clones! From awesome graphics to its high stability, the devs have done a fabulous job and has put in a lot of effort into this masterpiece! Thank you for this port devs as my pc cant run the pc version of pubg because of its low specs and im a big fan of this game, you guys have made it possible for me to finally experience this awesomness! Thank you each and every member of your team Tencent games! Thank you!",
        "For a mobile port of a fully fledged pc/xbox one game, it's not that bad. On my galaxy note 4, the graphics are set to low, but it doesn't bother me as I already play the pc version on low settings anyway. Yeah the controls aren't the greatest, but it's a mobile game, how else are you supposed to control your character? Well it would be nice if for android they considered external controller support, but other than that, I have no complaints about this game.  Yes I understand it's a beta just to see how this would work out on mobile and it's not bad. Controller support is all that's needed and this game would be golden.  Also I won my first solo game. 7 kills, chicken dinner on the house.",
        "Please please please include the auto equip feature on Xbox. I don't mind dumping items but sorting through items I require takes time. The ability to instantly swap parts when picking up a new gun, awesome. This game blew my mind. I have an old S5 Neo and only attempted the low settings but everything was incredibly smooth. Pleasantly surprised."

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",
        "App is Dripping with ADS. There is more effort into the ADS then the actual game. Game play for 15 secs, then watch 2 mins of ADS in order to play for 15 more secs. So you can watch more ADS. And when you run out of levels youre forced to play the \"Multiplayer\" (a.k.a. Computer) that plows into you,  and instantly resets. Yet you dont have the ability to do the same. Did I meantion Dipping with ADS. Graphics are cool. But not worth looking at just to watch ADS.",
        "Love the game but cmon guys, how many times are the race ranking going to get messed up. Finish first... But says you were second, second but now I finish third, third but wait... Fourth. Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio.",
        "Great Game! Really captures that what made SIMS fun and for mobile on the go at that! Graphics are reasonable considering it is new. When building houses the only drawback is you cant construct walls within a room, you have to work with box rooms. As well as you cant make like a out door patio without it being in a room enclosure.  All in all though I do highly recommend this game to you if youve enjoyed SIMS games in the past. Loads to do,events and updates to keep you busy for awhile."

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

        "It was enjoyable before the latest update, and the new features look interesting and will make the game better, but there's now a glitch with actually playing? Whenever I hit the ball, I receive some gems and go the distance that would take me two bounces in a matter of seconds before it resets and I'm back at the start. Thought it may have been just a one-off but it seems consistent. Hoping the developers can fix this soon.",
        "Great to use when you're on a quick break. However, the new update needs some more updates. I like how the ball flies faster... But now it's too fast to try and strategically bounce it @ end of flying. Maybe slow it down then. Also, first hit when I open is fine, all hits after, the screen goes black halfway through flying in the air...",
        "The game was good before the update. I like that ball flies faster, but now it's TOO fast, so much so that you can't really even bounce it, especially strategically. It's much too fast. I like the new characters, and that you collect diamonds randomly. Makes it more interesting for sure. However, there is a glitch now where you swing and the game resets back at the \"home base\". I don't know if it's because the speed is too quick, and the graphics themselves can't keep up or what... but the game is not functional in its current state. Willing to change my review once this is fixed though, as I actually really liked this game.",
        "Fun game. I would like to see an update that includes sounds effects, music etc. I would also like to see different characters to choose from and/or customization of the character(s). Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I like the game a lot and have been playing it for around a month. The new  update looks and cool and fun and I like the new features and character and stuff but I can only open the game and hit the ball once or twice before this glitch that starts happening. The glitch is that it will go the distance then reset and I won't get credit for going that for or get any money. Please fix fast and keep up with the updates",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review"

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

Because when I click the restart button then click the screen I would always end up behind the starting point even though I didn't move yet I die immediately why is that? pls fix it, everyone who played this game of yours would appreciate that.☺️😉 (btw I kept on dying on the first part of the game because of that so....I deleted the game!😀).",

The game is too hectic and the gravity is too much compared to the last update. It's a really good idea but I hope this isn't just a quick grab for cash.",
        "Having to restart the app every time you want to play instead of being able to hit RESTART sucks.  The app won't let you restart a game without a glitched ball each time.  Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",
        "it is extremely broken. after the first death, it starts you out right in front of the start platform and you cant play it again unless you completely close the app. its a shame that they dont even test the game before they launch it and that google play cant prevent it from launching in the first place. great game, but extremely broken.",
        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first.",
        "This is a great game and I love it but once u die the first time the game doesn't restart properly. The ball always drops before it even reaches the platform for you to start at which makes you die instantly. Please fix that because that's the only reason I can't give this 5 stars."

It's so much fun. I also find it to be a Great stress reliever for me. ThaNkS, pixel art app. I love this game, I find time each day to play... Very Relaxing 🤗🤗😀😀😉😉.",
        "I love the game and then when i saw that there was 3D projects i was so excited but they did not meet my expectations the controls were a little hard and the graphics were a little shady. Also there is a lot of adds i don't mind some adds but there's just so much so it would be nice if you cut down on the adds. Over all i really like the game i love that i don't need Wi-Fi to play this.",
        "Ghoulishness hzhdhdhdh VC Bob hzhdhdhdh hzhdhdhdh VC USD per the attached resume and cover and I will send a private youweirdo if you are doing well and that was the we can do it again but this is a nice day you can get the same thing happened to me and see if you have a nice weekend and I will have a good idea for a little while to get a good time to do this is an automatically by Microsoft outlook for iOS and room and the best way to do with the room and the fact I have to be busy and I am going be able but screen software to view the full image to open in full size and weight of the time to get it done by then and I have a great day room for the late response I got the email address to send me the link below to verify that the same as the one that was the best regards.. room was not able and the fact I am.",
        "Simply love it, if i may make a suggestion... how about providing an option to hide the finished works from the first tab? That way one would not have a lot of scrolling to do find a new piece to start. :) keep up the good work! 👍",
        "i finished a hard piece consisting 50 colors and it took me 2 days to fully complete it. however, i would like to suggest two things.   1) save a copy of the finished piece into gallery 2) remove the \"restart\" option on the \"my works\" site  if it wasn't for the \"restart\" option, i could've continue with other pieces.  to be honest, i wanted to rate 5 stars as this is so far the best game i've played. but i will give a second review if you would improve on the things i have just suggested above.",
        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too."

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "I love this game as it's challenging but not ridiculously hard! Very addictive & u can get coins & power ups within the game, 2 help u, so there's no need 2 buy any! 🤗 Pity more games aren't like that!! 😊",
        "I love this game. So addictive. I find it great that they don't use ads, this was a welcome surprise. Although the similarities to Peak Games' other game Toy Blast annoys me a tad. I do feel like Peak Games has just remade their previous game."

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "The renovations of the mansion are fun.  To earn stars to do reno or buy stuff is difficult.  I am at level 24 and after 3 days I can not pass it. The fact that we have a limited number of moves makes it very difficult8, if not impossible.  This way it is oriented for younger players, with faster reflexes not players of all ages or will slower actions. Please improves this feature of the games, make it more accessible to earn stars. In fact I sometimes need help from my grand sons to complete certain challenges. I am now at level 115 but my first comments are still valid.  I am going forward but I still find the games difficult.  It would be great to have other types of ways to earn stars.",
        "Love it! I'm stuck on this one level and it takes forever to get lives! (Free😁) Loving the game more and more. But we need more booster chances. I still like the game, I even cheat on Toy Blast with it! Im a huge fan of being able to rotate the booster. Need more moves availble please, on most levels it's just not enough.",
        "You know, I've been on level 495 for a week and I can't get pass it. I even used boosters and it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong? This game is awesome and I have enjoyed opening up NEW levels . Finally I opened the upstairs! YEAH!",
        "It is fun and addictive. One thing I would suggest is when a player pays to play make the puzzle less difficult to pass. Other wise the coins will be gone to quickly and no one wants to constantly put more money into a game that just eats it away.",
        "I 'my semi-hooked in it.  It's fun and challenging .  The characters are amusing, especially Austin.  I  do, however,  feel the games are  set up so that there are times when  it is impossible to win.  Games need to be winnable.   Some should be just be harder to win especially when  money  can be  involved.  Still, I  like it."

If you can please add the feature of talking to enemies when they get near. Or maybe let us chose our squad members (as many of them don't use voice chat)",

Thank you 😌😚 sorry for my bad english",
        "i was very addictated to this game until the last update. i can't even log in to the game, it said \"network error\", but my network is fine tho. i tried deleting data and reinstalling the game but nothing happened. once i can log in to the game, i can't even play normal matches. and my friendlist is gone wheter it's in game friends or platform friends. hope these problems will be fixed, i really love this game tho, i wanna play it soon :(",
        "It's controls are easy, and their graphics are pretty good. I rarely have any issues (not when I die a lot:) and if I don't here very small minor ones. In this game there are barely any ads, and it look's almost like PUBG. Only issue is that most of the clothing is real money",
        "This game is just... wow. It has great graphics after the new update, great gameplay and there is a lot to do in this game. It's designed very well, the map is great, everything about it is great. However, i was talking in discord with some people and they said that they couldn't play ranked. I launched the app, and i saw that i could not play it either. I hope this gets fixed soon, good luck! Edit: I can now play ranked mode, 5 stars",
        "I like the game graphic after update BUT please fix the ranked mode  . It says\"invalid season\"  and cant open it. I will give 5 stars after its fixed.   Also it would be  great if you add chat and in-game commands with next updates.  I still like this gamee so much"

        "I love this game. It has simple gameplay, and amazing graphics. The music is also incredible. I have a few complaints, nott about the the game itself but bugs. For starters, sometimes the game just won't turn on. Also, I'm not really sure how to unlock new levels. I get all three crowns in a level yet the next level is still locked. I end up just getting the level with 750 whatever you call them. And finally, in the the mountain level, the gem around the 80% mark in front of the the staircase or whatever isn't there. Whenever I perfectly complete the level it says I got 9/10 gems.",
        "I have one problem with the game. I got this game a few months ago, but had storage problems, so was forced to delete it. I got it back but now, I don't get any credits after I beat the level. I deleted it multiple times to check, but it didn't change. I don't know if this is a new update, but I'd like it if I were able to recieve credit (game money) after I beat the level. Otherwise, the game is beautiful, and fun to play!! So please help me solve this problem so that i can continue playing!",
        "I like the concept of the game but I'm not sure if it's my phone or the game but it doesn't rsgister when I touch the screen or there's a super obvious delay in when you hit the note and when the line actually turns. It's very frustrating when you know you hit it. But If this problem is due my phone I'll have to uninstall because I'm not going to play a game that I can't play without getting annoyed from the lag.",
        "Way to challenging. Also way too many adds and you only have like 2 levels unless you buy them or play the game for ages. Average game.",
        "For a game about following the song it doesn't. Don't bother if you want a fun tap along. Okay at some rare moments it lines up to the beat, say the base beep (usually followed by severe frame lag). but it fails to stay with it for more than a second or two, but you still tap at the wrong point bc thats how the dam music goes. fails at the core aspect, Pewdiepie advertised a waste of my time.",
        "So just now I was watching  pewdiepie  on youtube and watched the sponsored  video so I played it and it's actually fun and since I listen to music a lot I like the music In the levels good songs also can you put songs from bts on there from kpop  thank you and have a good day"

After all the money we've spent on the in-app purchases, I would never recommend anyone to buy anything from this game to risk having it stolen. Shame on you customer service of Roblox.",
        "Roblox is a great game. Being popular with kids and adults, this game is great if you want to let time fly. However, there are many problems with the (mobile) version that definitely needs improving. First, the controls. The default controls on mobile in Roblox can range from decent to downright awful. Some games, such as Phantom Forces, do not work well on mobile. Secondly, the free Robux scam. If you see an offer claiming that you can get free Robux, DO NOT FALL FOR IT! It's a scam. Thing is, if you see something that's too good to be true, then it's not true. Third, performance. Roblox can run fine on a decent gaming PC, but the game can barely handle itself on mobile. (Jailbreak, anyone?) Fourth, microtransactions. You need Robux for certain features in games. That's pretty much it. Roblox is an awesome game with a few problems, but otherwise, it's a great game and I highly recommend it.",
        "This game is really fun online game I love it I okay it everyday.  But there's an issue, Roblox pleaseeeee fix the lag and add more available controls for mobile pocket edition is solo laggy and some gears to use are un available to use and not able to okay most of the games. The graphics are  really bad on mobile and you can't higher the graphics which is boring, but I still love this game its really fun.",
        "Everone Have to play this game is the best game ever, but the hash tags can put for ONLY bad words? And for the game that i been playing Booga Booga can u make it as can make VIP server and bloxburg? Cause is hard to friend server with very less people so i hardly can play with my friends. I also find booga booga a unfair game i always get killed by others",
        "This game is AMAZING!!! Just fix a few glitches though. I play this game 24/7. I even get my tablet at bedtime and play on it. 1 last thing. Why did your moderators not get our reports and why can't we say simple words when we chat?",
        "It's a really great game but there are some flaws to it. First of the game is reall laggy for me and tends to always disconnect me in a game and I fell as if the reporting thing doesnt work either because they are never really blpcled for a while but those are tge only things but overall its an amazing game"

I wish therr was a way to go back and do the tutorial again and I accidently pressed during the first one and missed how to land. Lots of trial and error on that one. Also would be nice to know how the scoring exactly works.",
        "It's getting frustrating.. I'm into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can't manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "By level 4 no matter what score i get the bots always get about 15 higher. 1 game i would get 130 and the bots would get 145. Then when i get 160 they still get 175 showing this is rigged. That makes it so annoying with a lack of help from the developers make it annoying otherwise would b 5 stars if these issues were fixed"

        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side."

        "I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I'm not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain't getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold",
        "Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you're willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",

        "I could say I really liked this game, if it werent for the fact that my camp, which I'd been working on for quite a few hours already, reset. My level progress on the world map is the same, I just don't have my camp progress, which was around 67,000 points, so I'll probably be uninstalling. I really don't want to do all of that again. You guys need to fix this game breaking bug.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money."

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "I'm highly addicted to this game. It's a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it's really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!"

Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "I just find it kinda personal for you guys to ask for our personal things to be accessed to. Trying to ask for our location? Creepy. Trying to access our contacts and photos? Also creepy. I would've given this game a 5 star if it didn't ask for that stuff. And the ads, there is just too many ads. I will delete this shortly.",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",

        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Fun game, as the Score! Games usually are. Nice player system, solid multiplayer experience. But some changes need to be made: Tackling system needs revision. Need to be able to select tackler or cancel tackle. Far too much challenging from behind. Need to have tackle ready straight from kickoff, twice now I've conceded from kickoff because I had no tackle.  Players need to hold formation much better too. Higher levels with faster players easily get up the pitch in the break with no one around to defend.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "The fast rechargeable tackles should be removed.  The game is no fun now. Earlier I had to time my tackle perfectly so that I don't give away second balls. And same with the attack. I tried to get tackled in an area where I can win second ball. But now this fast tackle recharge has just ruined the game."

All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "Bright, colorful, addictive game play. Adorably happy graphics. Love \"Mr. Encouragement\", who exclaims \"sweet!\", & \"delicious!\" in his baritone voice. The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",

        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",
        "Fun game, very entertaining. Ads pop up too often, it opens my browser saying i have a virus. I cant avoid it and it happens very often. Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",
        "This game is great even my 5 year old brother plays this game. What I don't like about this game is that it sometimes freezes on me for no reason also while it freezes it doesn't let me shoot all of the people. You also have to get mostly everything in cheat roulette I don't like that at all it's so hard to get it in chest roulette because I always get coins. I like the coins but I get no other characters!!",
        "Was fun the 1st match but too many garbage ads after that. Completely ruins the game. Not sure why this has a 4.6 rating. Even if you waste your money you still get ads. So expect to see a ad every time you shoot an arrow, win a match, want a chest. Also another thing that's beyond annoying is when the ad forces your browser open with it in the middle of a match! Uninstalled and not wasting money on this garbage. Would not recommend to anyone and don't bother wasting your time."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I absolutely adore this app for it's witty, adorable characters and simple yet infinite concepts. I'm addicted! I have one issue, though. The limits on the barn and silo, frankly suck. I have eleven duct tapes but no screws so I had to pay diamonds I didn't want to spend so I could have a little flexiblility! Please fix this.",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan"

        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "Where can i file a complaint about the coin master's event game. The St. Patrick's attack master. I have attacked players many times but it won't count or the bar won't move. This is unfair because i can't redeem the rewards even i am playing every now and then. This is not the only event i have encountered that isn't working.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update",
        "its a nice game, but please rate the places lil bit low, it's hard to earn money, and when we save it for a place to buy, a raid takes place... increase the spin no. also atleast from 50 tp 60... it was fun at first.. but due to all this it's becoming boring."

        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "I downloaded it and played it. It worked for like 5 seconds. Can someone fix this or is it just me? Anyway if its just cuz its new to my phone then OK but if it doesn't work.. BOI Y DOES THIS GAME NOT WORK.. yet. Hopefully it works later. Um thats it. This is long. And that's it.♥",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "This game is so fun to play and the directions are easy to follow. I can literally play this game for weeks straight if I don't meet my goal. Each level has it's own feature and is hard to pass. There is practice mood if you want to get the layout of the map. The practice mood has checkpoints so you don't have to start at the beginning each time. Great game!!"

Also the safe box is getting on my nerves. I thought it was a limited time offer and would go away but it's been there for 2 weeks now!",

Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",

I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",

        "I love it and I'm addicted to playing it.   I like the fact that you can earn points if you don't want to buy them.  It would be great if tilting the phone had an impact.  don't change much though, its a great game:)"

If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "Game is very entertaining as others have mentioned there are many ads. I opted to purchase ad free to escape them, guess what? Nothing changed, charged my card ads remain. Google won't issue a refund because it was over 2 days ago. Emailed voodoo no response they don't seem to care. Do not give this app your money.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "What I couldn't even get taken to dinner before being forcibly bent over with ads? I mean with in 45 seconds; I downloaded, opened, played 2 games, and BAM! There it is. What, you couldn't even butter a brotha up? Hell I'd even been fine being lathered up with 10 minutes. Soo ok, I bite, i watch the ad. Attempt number 3 is going well l, bam I die. Tap to continue, well there's a 5 second cool down for revive I didn't notice at first. So I think to myself \"well that's probably what I watched the ad for.\" Wait the cool down, tap to continue. So I tapped, and BAM! ANOTHER AD. Hmm welp you wanted a rating and here it is. Give me about 5 minutes of gameplay before two back to back ads and I might consider having the game installed longer.",
        "DO NOT PAY TO GET RID OF ADS!! IT'S A SCAM...IVE PAID AND IT DID NOT WORK. EMAILED THEM TWICE NOW OVER A MONTH. NO RESPONSE AFTER THOSE ATTEMPTS. Great game but deliver to customers when they give you money VOODOO. And a simple email would be nice jeez",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die."

        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Good game but I expected it to be the best.  No loading issues or bugs encountered so far. Game loading takes about 6 seconds so no big deal. If madfinger sees this please add new maps and skins and weapons in SGDZ and enhance the game experience at FB as playing the game at gameroom sucks. I promise I will bring you about 100 new players if you did that.",
        "This is a really fun game, doing missions are entertaining, animations are really good. But the only problem is that some of the actions don't work properly.  Now what I am saying is that sometimes there are levels where you have to open doors by doing the action, kicking objects down to continue, but sometimes the door won't work. I know this is the first version so that doesn't \"BUG\" me.",
        "This game has little bit inspiration from many big games like destiny (duh), titanfall, doom. The game does have similarities to dead trigger. All the random loot is cosmetic, guns are easily obtained through missions. Good performance on my S7, but need internet 24×7 to run, even during campaign.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks.",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins."

Like it is now it's very hard to manouvre around incoming cops as you only have a split second to react. Maybe something like a copcar indicator would be in place as well.  For the rest I find the game great and super fun to play, although I'd hope to see newer, cooler and more expensive cars.

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "Not only are the graphics realistic, there so persise on everything. They even allow you to purchase different variety of guns. I just wish they let you assemble your own gun, which of course accessories. Best sniper game I've ever played.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "Well I like the game. It's fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don't open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.",
        "NejiOmeGa here!🙏 I have got to say this game is a \"quick paste first place!\" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!🙇 I've loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I'm a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who's Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherz😂😂",
        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I love this game, it makes walks more interesting and makes walking different routes worth it BUT my progression has all but halted. I live in a quite neighbourhood with limited players which is not the issue, raids are the issue. I can't get even one other player to raid with in my area so now the game is basically over for me as I can't 'catch em all'. I'm likely to quit if solo players don't get the same chances as groups because I have no choice but to play solo...",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "Overall it improved so so much since it was realased but I still don't like one aspect about Pokémon GO. You can't have parties with your friends and go out hunting the fun factor would go through the roof if you could play with your friends and go find some Pokémon. I still do like the game it encourages you to walk and all but if you could see your friends avatar and their Pokémon that would be great. Also when you catch the Pokémon the animation is a bit too long. And it would be cool if there was a small minimap when you catch the Pokémon. Waypoints would also be much appreciated and it would be such a great feature. I honestly think the game is a bit lacking right now but I hope it will still be improved. Cheers"

Az for going through 3 different phones with the app i have actually had luck linking it with my fb never had an issue. It would be alot better if non active clan members could get kicked. Im trying to achieve the legendary chest which is impossible with maybe only 8 active people. Other than that its pretty addicting. I play every morning before work and every night before bed. Plenty of levels to keep busy!",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.",
        "Great how adverts do not interrupt game. Perfect.   I am not 100% sure but when one player has just one king left it is not a draw right away. If computer has just a king left it says draw right away but if I do it carries on until I eventually get caught.   Anyways great app. Thanks a lot :)"

YOU CANT PUT AN AD EVERY TIME YOU FAIL IN A GAME YOU MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE A FEW SECONDS IN LIKE THIS! For goodness sakes, be reasonable! I won't download anything from you again, I hate developers like you, you are just milking as much money as you can from people."

You have a reputation to maintain or not?",

So that, when you lost or change your phone, you can recover the level and progress you had before instead of restarting from the beginning!!!!!!!!!!!!   If you could allow more media for sharing the game, it would be better, Facebook is not the only social media!!   And sometimes, it bugs!! Sometimes, the game is very slow and causes you to lose. Indeed, you shoot but the ball goes after many seconds even though the connexion is good!! Consequently you loose against a weak player, And this makes very angry!!!   Should those problems fixed, I will rate 5 stars.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person."

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The Sims keeps progressive challenges fun and interesting, and the Club Wars make for a very fun multiplayer experience!  The graphic attention to detail is amazing! It's quite relax just to watch the shadows of the skyline stretch as the sun crosses the sky or to see hot air balloons floating around the metropolis.  This game is lots of fun!!"

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it's pretty much an insta-win. I don't know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn't, you should probably put some spikes there or something.",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero."

        "Of course I love the game, but I can't get my free star fruit because the videos aren't playing. I can't redeem my free golden apples because of the videos not playing. I've lost out on more than 300 star fruit and 100 golden apples. Please fix this.",
        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime.",

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is glitchy, the story line is inconsitent, you have to always keep watching ads. On top of that you rehearse multiple times and it doesnt tell you have to get an a. I picked ballet and forced me to do hip hop for season 2. I tried to like it, but it's glitches before the dance perfomance how am I supposed to remeber the routine when i watch multiple ads and do routines that are not ment to be for the perfomance. Idk if its glitch ir a bug but it's just really bad. It is a cute game. Just not consistent."

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "Please improve the casino...it's kinda a bit unfair because no matter what I've spent, I don't seem to get a lot of diamonds... considering that the places require diamonds to upgrade...so in order for the game not to be so stressful, you should really improve the casino."

Hardly noticed any ads, which was also really nice. One of the BEST free games to take your mind off things!",

        "Great game most fun I've had on a mobile phone in years. Need to add wider turning radius so drifts are better and longer. Cars slide to much or maybe the cars are heavy? Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",
        "This is a fun game. I'm still personally waiting on that police chase mode. Also, can there be engine mods and body mods, and some more low end cars?😀",
        "It is a good game over all. Please add instructions in the settings on how to shift at the right time and add older cars. Like the 1966 E-Type Jaguar 4.2 roadster.Also please add the stats of the car when you're at the car choosing screen. And let us be able to change the tires of the cars and stuff like that.",
        "I love the game but the only thing i want to buy chiron ..i have money but i dont have diamond..if uh can add boht the option to buy cars..if want some diamonds .."

        "Good game. I love the fact you can get premium crystals or gems easily and on a regular basis.  Only thing I don't like is the golden cup shots or whatever they are called. Make an option to use those gems for shots instead of real cash would be nice but still earned 5 stars. Samsung galaxy note 8",
        "It is a fun and relaxing game up to a point.  If you start to advance too far, the algorithm changes and causes the computer to \"cheat\" more.  It will place you against those who have better club sets and  adjust the physics for your opponents that allows them to consistently make chip shots.  The game has become more frustrating than fun.  DELETED",
        "I think everything is fantastic about the game, but after this last update. The loading time is 20x slower if it loads at all. Galaxy phone. I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts."

        "Where is the cash out option? Just hit an ad for this that says it pays out..  now I wasted my money on the auto collect. If there is not cash out anymore than the ad lied and I want a refund",
        "The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don't waste your time",
        "not even fun, claw game is rigged and impossible to get 13.6 billion coins when u only get 7 coins at max per second which isnt even right bcuz it's slow and u would have to click it at least 600 million time for a good prize. too many adds aswell and even with the exploit I found still impossible to get the prizes"

        "Simple, Nice and Addictive. Almost perfect! But the game build lags from when the log records too many life events, which could be solve with a clean log record button. Another Thing is the name your child gets when your child is born in korea but you are from another country, the kid gets your name instead of your surname as his/her surname",
        "I love it! The only thing I would say is to let is have the option to transition without being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Or at least give us an option on the action board(with the profile of our person) with the option to identify as a transgender at schooling age of 6 or 5. Also, can we have the option to go to early schooling from 2 years? Some people do this. I love this game! It's very interesting and fun.",
        "I love this game and it leaves a lot to your imagination. I do have a few things I would really love to see in this game. I would love for there to be 5 bedroom houses. 4 bedroom houses just aren't big enough sometimes and mansions cost WAY to much even if you're making over 100k a year. Also if you can control your children as well as make suggestions to your spouse to get a job, work out, ect. Would be amazing.  I would love to be able to have little grand babies on the game as well as step children. Even though this last one is a small request I would love to have my children in order by age if I adopt an older child then the children I already have without them being at the bottom of the list. It already states that they are adopted in their details tab so they shouldn't have to be at the bottom.",
        "Great fun little life simulation with a lot of potential. Their need to be more career paths other than work, painting, music or ceo. I want to be an athlete, a career criminal, drug runner, politician etc. And the UI needs to be cleaned up. There's no reason why clubbing and holidays shouldn't be under leisure.",
        "I really like it but would suggest you guys correct a few errors. During one night stands, if you're a male it says your GF/BF found out because they found birth control in your pocket. That result seems it would only work if you were playing as a female. Would suggest you guys also add multiple ways they could find out you had a one night stand(they saw you, read a text, was told by someone else). Also would be nice if you could influence your partner to either work on their image(Gym, School, Work, etc) or suggest too. Other than that, fun idea guys.",
        "I was unsure about this..but it's surprisingly addictive! Really great if you just need a 'real world's escape. The Only issue I have is that it doesn't save! So each time you exit and reopen the app, it starts all over. Honestly, I probably won't keep it for long just because of that. I can't spend THAT much time on it to make it worth starting over every time I start it up."

        "This is my favorite game on my phone. I only got it for something else on a different game, but it turned out that I loved it. It is a really fun game and the controls and stuff are easy. The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "The game play and concept are awesome but the only thing I dislike is getting paired up with someone who's lvl 90 (I'm only lvl 23). This means I'm matched up with someone with superior skills, balls and agility than I am..... which pretty much means I know I'm gonna lose. I don't mind losing but it kinda sucks when the favor is tilted in the other players favor straight away. I just did a $100.000 game and guess what? My opponent was lvl 90......"

        "Great little game except i downloaded it to play in a quiet place but after turning off music and sound it over ride the settings. I also put my phone mute on and it still played music on ads and when pressing the arrow button in the game. Not impressed",
        "The ads in this game made it unplayable. I used to love this game and I downloaded it to try playing again and I would get minute and a half ads after every third attempt at a level. It felt like nearly every time I failed a level it would ask me if the level was too hard and I needed a hint. This game is incredibly obnoxious to play with ads on",
        "Well i would give this five stars but you cant watch an add to get a power up! And you should lower the ad mount of adds i cant go in for 10 seconds without an add popping up!! Overall good great game",
        "Way too many ads after every time I lose or go onto another level an advert pops up. Verry annoying. But the gameplay is decent.",
        "Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.",
        "I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!"

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "Cannot get the app to load properly, but it is a really fun and addictive game. Great challenges, and I like seeing what designs others have come up with. I've won challenges with very little money, it is possible, if that is a concern for people. I would like to see challenges developed more quickly, and ways to earn more money. I usually have very little money to work with. Maybe have an option to get keys or money when voting. But overall I really enjoy the game."

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Update: Now it won't even open. Once you find out your progression is rigged, the fun wears off. You will have a win streak going, them \"mysteriously\" a machine will show up with just the right set up to beat yours. Then once you finally get the right configuration to beat that one (however long that takes) another machine with the perfect set up to beat yours shows up again preventing you from progressing. Over and over and over....",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete."

On a chess exercise game with a recurring subscription fee to fully unlock?? Every single thing about this game is designed to be such a ridiculous money grab I actually laughed. It does have a very nice interface but there are a lot of completely free or one time purchase alternatives that are every bit as good.. Definitely don't waste your time and money on this..",
        "OK guys as far as the overall experience with the app was good I could use it all the time to progress my skill at playing chess just like anybody i.e.  any practice  1 possible flaw or idea that I've found which may shift Play Magnus app's popularity is to make a free version of the Magnus Trainer app with only the free content intending this app to be a demo and add more daily activities and challenges to keep them on your app longer  which of course will always end prompting the user to download Premium Magnus which requires an initial $5.00  purchase to begin downloading Magnus Trainer Premium enabling user full access to all the content app offers them. Followed by subscription payments made monthly at the set price of $5.   Might be dumb idea but food for thought I know Runescape had their free server separated from Members only servers also at $5 / mo.  People may  be able  to understand more clearly that if they want the full  app to get way better skills on the board if they want lessons of this caliber then it requires subscriptions to support your hard working team.   The haters will always hate... Keep it up good app",

        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",

The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "I like playing it, its a good time killer but why are there so many ads?! I cant play one song without an ad to advertise some other game! Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "Amazing game but has the worst user interface ever. It's such an ugly interface and confusing to say the least. I also can't stand how many ads there are and that there is no lifetime vip purchase. Games like this get annoying fast. Such a shame."

It happened only once; looked like the opponent was hacking the game. He was potting all of the balls like that, and there was also full network. If you can fix it, then the game can be improved.",

I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",

The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Great game, I totally love it. I don't mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills."

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "This game is fun and amazing but at times, it gets boring. More levels and modes need to be added and new players need more chances to get emerald or plantinum chest. For some reason, a file wasnt working at and the game won't load. Plus, it won't let me sign in to Google play. Other than that its a good game.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game itself isn't  bad but it would have been better if there weren't  ads popping up every time I finish a race. It's  very annoying. I know this is a free game still using ads at that place isn't a good choice. I mean who does that? It really ruins the fun afterwards."

It's so awesome and I absolutely love how everything is pixelated and that makes it more charming. Not to mention that the music is fantastic as well and I never get tired of listening to it!",

        "this game is basically an app for watching ads. you are forced to watch ads in order to progress. on the top of that, when you upgrade your stuff, the game randomly starts an ad. to have double money, you have to watch an ad. to collect diamonds.. guess what, watch an ad. to start idle mode? yes, watch an ad. utterly disgusting, terrible design.",
        "Holy ads! Intrusive ads every few clicks. EVERYTHING is ad-based. Good gameplay, but obviously an app created to generate ad revenue.",
        "Really has a satisfying gameplay to it as you upgrade and become more powerful. However the gem portion gets quite slow and boring. Ive spent well over a week on the gem part and am only on the 5th special gun.",
        "This would be a fine time-waster if they reign in the ads, until that happens, about like the plague.  They started out as a means to (optional) easy buffs. Fine, annoying, but not that bad. Suddenly, random ads are popping up in the middle of the game and you get nothing out of it. Totally unacceptable way to run a game. Don't bother, there are thousands of other time wasting idle/incremental games that show an ounce of respect for their customers. These guys simply don't."

        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "I absolutely love this game. The music is good, the challenges are really fun and... well, challenging. It has taken me several days of being asked by the game if I would like to review it because I was having so much fun and didn't want to stop playing long enough to review. But here you have it. This game is well deserving of a great review. I'm going to go back to the game now so I can keep on rushing.",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "I'm obsessed with this game. It's not just playing to beat your best score. There are challenges that you can beat as you play and it makes it okay to have a bad run sometimes because you can still beat the challenge lol. Not frustrating, just so much fun. Not sure if my review makes sense, just play this game ok."

Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "I love this game. When my sister downloaded it on her iPad i was sooo addicted to it and now i am downloading it on my own phone!!!! I really recommend to try it at least for once. If you will do so you will not be able to delete it easily beacuse you will be addicted!!!!!",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I thank it is good because it's relaxing and better for your brain and you can make friends and also build awesome things this is a good as Minecraft I have seen yet actually that's awesome thanks for using this written by mangel",

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Actually it is much easy and had very less features. It is not like a competitive game. In 2hours I have nearly unlocked 31 levels.  Make it a tough one....graphics is good but lots & lots of ads, very annoying ! And add scores there rather than medals",
        "Love the game. Outstanding graphics and the physics is close to perfect. I'd happily pay for this game but it's an ad-supported game so I'll just keep playing on my ad-free, unconnected tablet. When a paid version becomes available I'll be first in line. Until then, I play for free with no ads. Oh, there's only 816 levels so it doesn't go forever.",
        "Fun playing. Passes some idle time. Habit forming. How much more do I need to say before get something free? Lol...",
        "Meh!!! It not what i expected I'd like to do the training but also the 1 on 1 competition. If any1 know of a pool app. Hit me up.",
        "Great game....way too many ads. I would pay for an ad free version since the ads annoy me so much that I'm going to wind up uninstalling it."

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "This WAS my favorite game and was happy to spend a small amount of money to make my team competitive. If you are a new player DON'T download this game unless you plan to spend thousands of real money you are too far behind to compete. It now takes about 15 million in game currency to max out a character with all it needs. you will only make about 8 million a week if you complete every task and join a good team. So basically 2 weeks per character and you need a minimum of 5 maxed characters to make a dent",

I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info."

The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",

        "Great game with fun objectives that keep it challenging until level 15.  Only issue with it is that ive recently lost all.my gems due to some sort of bug and now i dont really want to continue playing just to get back to 500 gems to experience something other than sky summit.",
        "Ok I'm mad I got a new phone. There is no way to save progress. I lost 1,000 gems and 2 million coins. This is BS. They should make it so u can connected thru Facebook like most of the other games. Get it together temple run 2",
        "Great game with fun objectives but its really boring to run in the same land again and again .And in order to run in a new land we need 500 gems it should have been less Like 250gems. And the new lands should be full of surprises. And with more score surprises should increase .I was really happy to play blazing sands for free. But it should have been more surprising.",
        "I abosulutly love this game. It won't get a 5 star though because I have had 4 different coin skins get taken away from me and those were actually my favorites. Idk if it was a glitch or I didn't do something but plz tell me what it is"

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don't waste it here. Good luck!",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun."

        "Addicted! Another useful platform to release my creativity as well as reading other creators awesome stories in a wide variety of different genres. The different character styles are another thing that peaks my interest although the CLASSIC characters kind of freak me out haha. Nevertheless I LOVE it!",
        "I like the game. But it drives me nuts I can only play for a little bit. Then wait 3 hours to play again. The ticket reload is annoying. They should have ways to earn more tickets, and give you at least 5 tickets. Lol ...I thought the characters talked, but they don't. So that'll be a fun if they add that in. I've been play bad boys and I like it.",
        "This is a really fun way to read and loads of great stories inside. You should get passes quicker and free when you buy diamonds like they used to do it. The ads are annoying but I know they help pay for the app too. You should be able to skip ads with purchase for a short time at least.",
        "I'm still new to this but so far I like it... Just getting used to it.. Although sometimes I wish I had a different choice then it gives sometimes, and be nice if it was longer, and not have 2 have so many diamonds and wutnot cause everyone don't have a bunch of $$ to keep putting out, so we'll see how it goes n go from there, otherwise so far it's interesting.",
        "This game is amazing. I can play and discover many interesting stories. But I have a problem its an issue long ago. It's about connecting to the network because the app in my phone can't connect well to the internet its an error. PLEASE fix it...😣😣😣",
        "Great story's to read.the ones I love to read is Isak &Finn.what can I say I love all stories and some are my favorite ones I just read over and over,like Love is a Drug.p.s I was playing pitch perfect in the deep treble it only let me go up to 18 only and know that I want to play it it takes me back to my favorite."

        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "It's mindless fun and the soft gore while eating a human is fun. The underwater scenes are visually pleasant. I also like the feature that warps you to the North Pole once a day. The random vortexs that throw you into space are also a really fun feature.",
        "Love the game but in the last couple days, I'll get into a warp and it'll freeze completely on me. And It truly disappoints me because I could've had so many coins by now. I cannot play the game at all with it not freezing and making me start over.. I don't know if it's a virus or what but I wish it would get fixed."

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

First adds would take forever to play then they wouldn't play at all and it would freeze up till you closed it out then my whole phone froze up has NEVER happend before.

        "Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "PAID VERSION NOT AD FREE! Got sick of the ads in this game cutting off the audio from my podcast in the background, so I bought the PAID version.  Big Mistake!  Fewer ads but they are *much* longer and they can't be skipped or stopped.  I plan to get a refund on this deceptive app!",
        "The game is fun and addictive, and it also has a lot of content but unfortunately there's a bug that hasn't been fixed which is the time. Sometimes on many occasions, the level starts with the time passed like 1-3 minutes. Say I want to get 3 stars in a level by finishing it under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. When I start it, immediately one minute and a half are past without me doing anything and I have to restart the level to get it to zero. Sometimes I forget and end up finishing the level with 2 stars because of that bug and having to restart the level once again. I appreciate your support and offering the game for free but don't forget to get a fix for this bug, please. Thanks 🌹",

Banner ads, long boring ads between each level, jammed into players brains (so the developers wish).  I am immune to advertising and simply tune it all out. My only reaction being to UNINSTALL this otherwise enjoyable game and warn others about it's predatory intent.",

        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "Too many adds to be great. No videos available in the coin menu, yet constant adds popping up? Zero logic there. If you space the adds at least 15 minutes apart, then a player might be able to focus on an objective in the game. Every 3-5 minutes is stupid. Can't even play long enough to see if I like the game because the adds. Graphics are nice.",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played and ever will play. I recommend it to everyone. Even if it doesn't look good to you get it its awsome. I think or know you will like it. Also it's so cute and the graphics are awsome. Also everything is priced so well. I love how you add new stuff often. Also you can level up fast, and let go of your purse into a new family.

        "It's a fun and cute game. No violence no dead cats all over the place, but something that worries me is that the towers don't upgrade while you're gone. I upgraded my mini van like 3 times and it's still lvl 1. Not sure if it's just that certain tower or what... But otherwise love it!😛😉🔥😀",
        "I don't know how you got that idea, to be honest the troop shop is awesome. But I think it is better to add some new gameplay like 1v1,2v2 battles such that . The troops are also marvellous. I stucks during attack. I'm getting too many ads, it's wasting my time. Please fix this.",

        "Fun game so far but one issue I think I have is the performance for some reasons when I'm playing if I attack a camp it gets SUPER laggy and it runs smoothly when I'm not attacking and just upgrading the camp. And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon. It's a good game but you've been warned..."

        "This game is a PUBG clone using Minecraft graphics. Because of that, I downloaded it as a joke. However, this game is surprisingly good. It runs well and is fun, so I would highly suggest getting it.   Edit: I see lots of people talking about boring gameplay, and I think they just haven't had a good game. After over 50 games and plenty of wins, this game is always fun to drop in to",
        "cool game ad was coming up for some reasons after i play and little laggish after i landed after 3 seconds it hangs up and continue and please add Helmets armours boots pants and something like that to be able that were armored and make the map bigger as the PUBG map and the Blue zone much laggy when i got there but great game",
        "Great game ! Find it super fun and easy to get lost in it for an hour or two :) ! Could improve on weapon drop locations like it can either be clustered with weapons or to bare .. also being able to join friends would be good .",
        "I think the only good aspect is auto ahot if i was on the devolper team i would suggest that the frame rate should be worked on. I get crazy kill streaks there should be awards cor that.",
        "It's a very addicting game but I have some suggestions 1)plzz make the map little big not much 2)plz add more weapons 3)add interiors 4)last but not the least controls of the game should be upgraded",
        "It's the worst game I ever played it's sending me off my page just so I can watch an ads please fix this game   I would rate it 5 but please make it stop sending me off my game just to see an ad"

        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

I lost everything.all the coins, all the work I did on the islands. Don't know wat your programmer's did. But it pissed me off. I will not start over.i enjoyed the game played it for years. 700+ days played without interruption.",
        "Very addictive! Some of the missions are impossible to finish without using your real money. Would recommend but with a warning: don't get your hopes up! Takes a very very vey vey long time to make progress if you don't use real money...",
        "I can't believe you wouldn't offer an update to access this app? We the collective have spent hundred of dollars over the course of time. Your suggestion to contact fun plus?? We've been told that Android does not have an update available? Neither can I access the game on my fire. I've spent money throughout 115 levels. I'm sick to my stomach.",
        "I have some problem I want to know My theme in game missing because? I delete cache  now i can see my theme only. But i can't see other neighbors theme  my friends can't see my  theme farm too i want to know what happens? Please help me My ID FBTFYZU thank you.",
        "The game app opens and closes immediately on my iPad, my Amazon tablet and my Android phone. This started to happen at 12:01 CST today  What's going on. I spent a lot of money and if I can't play I want refunds.",
        "I love playing this game however I have loads of missions I cannot complete due to needing loads of RC and it's so annoying, is there an easier way to receive this rather than only getting it when I level up? Its so god damn annoying because I have missions that are incomplete and I can never save enough because there's always something or a machine that's needs it."

Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "The game is very fun and progression is steady as you get better, on the downside once you get through your first play through with the app and come back later there are 30 second adds that pop up after every other round or so. A little disappointing but no biggie the game is really quite fun.",
        "I feel like I would really like this game but it is not working on the Android phone. So I have never actually played the game but I have tried to open it up like 50 times.  Every time I tried to open it, it would just lag out right when it was going to show me the home screen.  If this gets fixed then I will play this game and most likely enjoy the game but for now it is awful.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them."

        "Well I think you need better graphics and I don't like how it is slow when you turn. Plus it has TOO MANY ADS! I just started playing this game! The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",
        "I love this game, it's sooooo fun but my only problem is the ads. It was fine when I first downloaded it, there were no ads but after I upgrade the game, all of a sudden there's ads every second. If you can get rid of the ads, I would greatly appreciate it",
        "There's so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to start. First off your in a confined space and if you go so far you just hit a blue wall. If in was infinitely generated and you could go farther it might be better. Second its kind of slow when moving. Third since the whole confined space thing you have each different biome all pushed together so when you walk two steps your in a different biome and its small. So you extremely need to make it better.",
        "\"Oh, it's just like Minecraft.\" Yes. It's exactly like Minecraft. Well no, not quite: this game is awful and that game is great. Overall, terrible game, fake reviews. Outta this house",
        "The game is good but too many adds they need to add animals and you should be able to interact with the chests and furnaces .  The game needs to be more like minecraft then it would be better.  I suggest you don't install it 😠.  It's so boring DON'T install it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "So, the game itself is incredibly enjoyable and fun. Sometimes the controls get me here and there, but I'm sure, with time, I'd get use to it. The thing is, THERE IS NO TIME. Literally every minute, I get a thirty second ad. I'm just here building my home and making foundation when all of a sudden, an ad pops up. I say, \"oh okay, it's just one, whatevs.\" WRONG. It is now ten, just over the past 5 minutes. This game has serious potential, if only it'd let us play the game and cut out the ads. I'm spending more time watching ads rather than using time to efficiently play the game. It irks me, so I uninstalled the ap. It really is a good game, just lower the ads from 2 per minute, kay?"

It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "Wow EA proves they are the worst company again. I spent £50 pounds on the old  version and I can't use the old now and if bought on the old one you will have to buy them again on the free version.  And yoi have to buy the add free addition which was free in the original game.God ea sucks",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps."

They're not well-distributed, having reached a point where no ads would show up after a few runs, and then one would appear after every run no matter how short. A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",

        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",

        "Wow, since when does an 8 flush beat an Ace flush? This is hands down the worst poker game in the play store!!!!!",
        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players"

However, it's still missing something and at the end it'll get boring fast. Overall, I kinda like the game and the pixel art.",
        "Not a bad click game except the ads don't work half the time. I have to exit the game otherwise my \"sponsors\" stop working after a couple clicks",
        "Best game ever! Never liked a clicker game before, but this one has just changed it. I loved it, could play all day long.",

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "I just started the game a couple of days ago, but I'm already hooked.  Like most games, you kind of learn as you move along, but a little more guiding would be very helpful. Thanks for making a fun game! I am having a problem getting past the loading screen though. I tried clearing cache, forced stop, delete files, even uninstalling and reinstalling again.",
        "Easy to learn with loads of variables to keep it interesting. Graphics are stellar. As with most 'free' games, there are lots of incentives for you to get out your wallet; if you're as unwilling to do so as I am, you'll have to be patient. Can't fault the developers. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though"

Moderators should do their job and watch the actions of everyone in every game. I don't think you'd do it, so im never really going to give you my 5 stars.",

        "Well! I LOVE THIS!, a few things though. Maybe you could put the vip prices a tiny bit lower so you will have more purchases and I think you should be able to do EVERYTHING you can do on laptop/computer on app because sometimes I get really annoyed! And when you email we all saying your password has been changed do you mind saying the new pass aswell because I cant log on to my account: Skintlove&lt;3 and I recently bought vip on it. ANNOYED! Anyway I know that is a lot of faults but I life this game especially on laptop and its my fave game (:",

Like its really easy to shift from one side of the screen to the other without taking your finger off your device other games like that don't do that. There are lots of obstacles my one problem is that you can only jump on the small buses like what about the big ones that's a problem that sucks but overall get this game. When you look at the pictures that is exactly what it is its super fun!😁",
        "I like the game but, the think is you can get any lives and sometimes when I swipe the game won't move my character and when you have to get some of your missions and you have to get them in total I hate cause it's very hard and some of the goals are to but, other than that I LOVE the app",
        "I love this game it is so entertaining and you can play it anywhere because you don't have to play with internet. this game can allow you to mix and match the  characters with the cars and even allows you to play different games with dragons dinisours. I love this game!💖💖💖💖💖",
        "I used to like this, but since the update with Lego elves, the gameplay become worst, it's not smooth, I even cannot jump over the bus properly. I use Xiaomi MI5s with Snapdragon 821 and 3Gb RAM, and the graphics and gameplay is still lag",

Correct me if I am wrong about it.",
        "This game relies on internet connection far too much to actually be able to play while traveling. I have been disconnected several times in the middle of getting the golden statues, so it not only takes my tickets (which are hard to come by), it also doesn't give me the golden statue when I won it and the internet went down.",
        "I love the game but three times now it has not given me my diploma for jobs I passed in Hawaii with is keeping me from moving on to the next level.  It's very frustrating.",
        "Nice idea but crashes too often. I like the way you can travel to different countries and learn about different places. Unfortunately it crashes too often",
        "I spent a good amount of time today trying to figure out why I was not getting job diplomas. I pass the quizzes with enough points but it doesn't give me the diploma. I even updated the game just in case. Advice?",
        "Super fun game, play as much as you like, don't have to spend money, travel around the world and learn about different cultures. Usually only very minor loading issues but probably because of my own connection. Add more diplomas!"

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",

If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I've had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)",

I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I've been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play."

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",

Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",

Ads are worse now and lock up the game all the time.  I have a Galaxy S8 and fast Wi-Fi,  so it's not my phone.  Other apps work fine.",
        "In 2013 I paid to remove the adds yet they are everywhere and proper in your face! What's the point of giving the option to remove them if you have no intention of doing it? Oh that's right, because all you care about is your bottom line and you don't give a damn about your paying customers!",
        "Wth ! Game gets hanged, as soon as you use mighty scope in mighty league. Not one time, or occasionally. Everytime since last update. WHAT A MESS ! Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.  AS EARLIER SAID, ENOUGH OF NUISANCE, DOWNGRADING TO 1STAR. GAME KEEPS HANGING, ADS KEEP INCREASING, WHAT A MESS TO SUCH A ONCE BEAUTIFUL GAME.",
        "This game has been freezing up every few mins for the last couple of months, and on multiple devices/accounts, causing me to lose power-ups. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.",
        "What happened to Angry Birds? I bought it years ago, now that version has been replaced by this terrible terrible bucket of advertisements. I played a couple games and realised it works on some sort of star system where you essentially buy each level with the stars you earn or buy with real money. Angry Birds used to be good, now it's just a cash printer for Rovio. This game was made and paid for almost a decade ago, yet they're still profiting for nothing. Don't bother with this game anymore.",
        "App freezes in mid play. The commercials are horrible. You can't do anything without a Dove hair    commercial.  Please fix this game so it stops freezing up !  I can't even play anymore.  Why don't you read these reviews and fix this issue.  I have you but you keep asking for the same information."

Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊"

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

You have to back out and start all over only to have it freeze again. Will probably delete it as it's now useless to try to play.",
        "Frustrated.  I was in the 2000+ level and I just got a new phone.  All of my apps got transferred.  Went to bubbles and it started me back at level 1.  I will be disabling.  I can't start over and I spent money for more tokens.  Very angry.",

        "One of the best bubble/ball shooter games. And yes very addictive.  Only 2 negatives... bubble at the bottom unable to move to the left or right as in another favorite game. Secondly there is a creepy ad or something dark that pops up periodically between games.",
        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?",
        "Game is ok first 1000 levels but pass that it starts freezing in the middle of a play and the videos freeze. The worst part you complete a level and it won't register it and makes you play the level over and over again even though you've completed it and no balls left. I had to play some levels 2-5 times before it thinks it's complete.  That is very frustrating"

        "Highly addictive. Great fun. Only downside Is, when you get to higher levels, upgrading buildings takes way too long. I'm talking days! Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "I really enjoyed this game for a while. But anytime theres any sort of update the app wont load up. And it just so happens that whenever this occurs it's during a kill event. I cant explain how stressful this game can become if you actually commit to playing it",
        "This is COMPLETELY pay to play. If you want to spend serious money on a free-to-play game, this might be it for you. But if you don't have deep pockets this is a very stressfull game. Way to many high level players that are bulliers and jerks, they eill attack uou just bacause they cam.",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "Absolutely no support available in the game.  If you're able to take money, people should be able to contact you.  Game is also geared for higher level players to advance by ganging up on new players.   I was attacked 19 consecutive times in a 5 minute period with 6 players attacking me at once.  In short, don't waste your time",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately."

        "A bit dissapointed, it gets repetitive and boring after the first few tries. The object of the game is to capture as many lego heads as possible in the short distance from the garage to the end of the track. But, some lego heads are unobtainable because they're too high in the screen and the vehicle does not jump or steer, the only vehicles that do give you a bit of altitude are the helicopters. You obtain extra scene parts and lego character pieces if you have accumulated enough lego heads during game play. So, I'm foreseeing small kids getting frustrated because they can't get enough lego heads, when it's not their fault, the game is in autopilot, only requiring one button to make the vehicle go. Graphics are good, simple. Players can choose and build their own characters and vehicles.",
        "This game is amazing it's controls graphics and gameplay are also amazing if you have common sense then load this game I am realy sure that this game will get more and more rates and review please make one you tube video of this also named as Lego juniors 2",

        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!",
        "Could be better. It is a great game. Could use different music as it's literally same as the penguin race game. It also contains false advertising. It says, 'Buy anything and get rid of ads for free'. This is not the case when pressed on. You have to pay £0.78. Sort out your English.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "I played this back in high school and thought you know I wanna play it again, it was my favorite. , VIP access? Are you f***ing kidding me? I will never play this again, you ruined the best game out there for what? 20 dollars a month? For one that's more expensive than xbox live is. And 2 that is just selfish. Its an app, you guys had it right the first time."

        "Amazing gameplay, perfect controls, and an all around very fun FTP app. I'm not normally a fan of \"stay in your lane\" style games, but this one is actually fun. Watch your hops and make sure you time your landings right. If you miss the landing you can go from holding a large lead to struggling to get up the next hill...I highly recommend this game!",
        "This was my favourite game.. Ppl say you need to spend money, lol.. I haven't spent a cent, I'm in division 2, lvl 15 and in track 7..  You just need to grind to get money, and be perfect at the tracks.. (restarting many times)  great game.. Would be good if we didn't need to spend so much gold bars to keep upgrading bikes but",
        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!"

        "To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn't.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don't let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that's why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That's not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.",
        "Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don't like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.",
        "You know this is the best chess app. The magnus tuned engines works great. You actually improve with each passing day. Few points too. I would have given it 100 stars if possible if the graphic would have been better. The graphic you know, like black and white makes a very depressing combination. Also an option for online game with others would make it a perfect app.",
        "the engine is actually good, I gave that 1 star for that, yet the interfaces are sluggish, very clunky, slow, and you can't even change the default board colors without playing a lot of this, with ridiculous brainpower credits.  it's slows down my new smartphone too much when another chess apps are practically lightweight. and without good sides such as analysis or online multiplayer matches.",
        "Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.",
        "This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...😁"

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",
        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups",
        "This game is the WORST!!! The controls don't work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot",
        "It's honestly a fun game, and I'd love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it's just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that's a problem. I'm not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It'd be five stars if it didn't give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn't worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try \"Run\". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)"

Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue.

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "good game but y'all gotta fix how valuable the gems are. its impossible to get lots of gems without paying and you're only rewarded 1 per video. and then it costs me 150 gems to get TWO hatchery spots? that's bs. fix that and I'll give 5",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous."

        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you",
        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!"

        "It's good. A decent game that forces you to grind and wait, OR you could spend money to buy gold to open more chests. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that to watch ads to get rewards, I have to give it my LOCATION, ALLOW IT TO MANAGE MY CALLS, and access to my media. Why do you even need my location and phone number to watch an ad for rewards?",
        "Love this time killer. Its a simple game, simple concept. Easy to learn the controls by yourself, and unlock stuff. Simplistic graphics, and will most likely run smooth in any device. Now, the only issue here is, that unlocking a chest is a tad bit too expensive, and gaining coins and stars are a bit hard. Tho, i havent unlocked quests yet, so i dont know. Either way, Awesome game, cant wait for future updates, and i really hope the devs will add new worlds, characters, weapons and customisations maybe?",
        "I love this game in every way. It's a great time killer and it's fun to collect the helmets. The chests don't wait too long to open and the challenges keep you from just messing around. My only complaint is the lack of creativity in the weapons. If I work hard enough to get a new helmet I would like to see at least one unique weapon per helmet. Instead it is a different combination of the regular weapons.",
        "As a 3D MMORPG dev it is hard to find something that is enjoyable on this damned store. However your combination of simplicity mixed with a variety of prefabs and abilitys alongside particles and everything else make this an excellent game. You dont spam ads, you don't make it incredibly difficult and you don't make it pay to win.  A tip of my hat to you guys. I would give this 5 stars if I didn't have a buck fifty skins in my face all the time....",
        "Great game......the only problem in this game is that the lack of information about a weapons..... i wish their are something like a short tutorial about the types of weapons or a short video on what happen if the weapon equiped..... since the game is just currently launch... its normal that it has minor bugs.... but please fix it as soon as the updates come....for a summary: A reallly great game and entertaining",
        "I enjoy the gameplay and various unlock/progression mechanics, but the game is extremely laggy. It may be my device, however. Also, some hitboxes seem to be mercilessly accurate and it can be very frustrating. That may not be something to change, but definitely something to note."

There's too many good snipers and frankly that to me would be awesome to fix! Lower the price on the first rifle because of that I stopped playing the game for a couple of days!",
        "Sometimes it's fun and most of the time will really piss you off. Like as soon as you log in someone has already got 20 kills. Or you get matched up with people that are at a much higher level. It can be very frustrating,  my guess is that there trying to get you to spend lots of money.",

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",
        "I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I'm sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP",
        "I LOVE this app! And I'm so glad it's free! Everyone is like 'it's the same thing over and over again' but they're not actually getting into this game. They're are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!",
        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least",
        "This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I'm eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐"

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "Realy fun i could play this game FOREVERRRR!!!!!! without even deleting it. its realy a chilling game though. Could you add a granny mode that you play as the granny and do whatever i want like: kill my grandkid, just watch my grandkid escape, and, or jumscare my grandkid. That would make it more fun and funny oh, and also could you make when i tranculize granny she won't dessapear and, make an animation where she stands up after she is tranculized that would be cool😊😊😊😊😊😀😀😀😀",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz"

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks.",
        "This game will cheat you! I  upgraded a bunch of my characters but the next time I logged in nothing had saved! The funds I used to upgrade were also gone, of course. Don't waste money buying anything because the upgrades you make just disappear.",
        "Let your app data be backed up... My old phone has to be replaced and after a lot of work everything was still not saved. I feel this is a pretty simple thing to have included and a dumb thing to leave out. Fail. Thanks for taking my money and running."

Games for children have never been so interesting and exciting. All our heroes of the game very much want to get to their homes, and so they hurry to buy a railway ticket at the ticket office of the railway station so that they can take their place in the car before departure. And now, our locomotive with multi-colored cars arrives at the platform, and the cute little animals are hurrying to take their places in the carriages to set out on their way to their home. They sit down by the windows to admire the passing landscapes along the way. But young passengers do not yet know that the children's railway will bring them many surprises and hard trials. To get to the right station, you will have to try very hard and apply a little of your efforts. The trip will be very difficult. On the way our little passengers will have to stop many times to help another train to collect the lost cargo, to show sharpness, to take special tools and to repair broken railway rails, to repair the bridge, destroyed by the terrible earthquake, to get its train out of the tangled underground labyrinth and much more. The last whistle sounded and the merry locomotive set off. Ahead of us waiting for a fun adventure, a very exciting and colorful journey. Games about the train - a real godsend for parents and their kids. These are development games, which represent a whole set of developing elements that are present at every stage of the game. They teach your child color perception in a playful way, teach you to distinguish figures and count, develop visual memory and fine motor skills, attention and logical thinking. And, very importantly, will introduce your baby to the endless variety of the world around him Immerse yourself with your child in a sea of joy and positive emotions, you just need to download our games about locomotives and go on a journey.

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",
        "Most stories are good but its Very very very pay to read. With weekly and yearly subscriptions. After reading every story in 1 day, i canceled my free trial and uninstalled. I refuse to pay 3 dollars a week. Or even 50 a year to just sit and wait for them to come up with more material. On top of the subscription cost they ALSO have gems you buy and spend on making the fun choices in the stories. So my advice it to start your free trial, cancel it, read every story in a day. And then uninstall and thank me for not spending money to wait weeks for one more story.",
        "Well the reason I put a zero on the graphics was bc I didn't get to see them.😢 I just wanted to let you know that I want to request a update on the game maybe just like let people see the video chats and not the pictures. It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry."

Longest level I've played is maybe 15 seconds. I have beat the first two sets of 50 levels within about 10 to 15 minutes. I'm curious, you know how there are game runners who beat games in a record time? Is there some kind of game Runner tournament or any challenges for this game? I am beat this game completely in arecord time. Thank you developer for making the best game ever. This game can actually bring out the genius in anyone. Btw, I haven't used any hints also, I'm impressing myself... Yay!!!😎😎😎",
        "\"contains ads\" is an understatement! unless you plan on paying, dont bother.  you play a stage for 5 to 10 seconds and get an ad after EVERY SINGLE STAGE! AND THE ADS USE DATA.  videos. long ones. spammy. uninstalled.    i would have maybe paid if the game did not turn me off so quickly with their ridiculous amount of ads that made me annoyed instead. so i uninstalled instead of getting far in, and rewarding dev with $$$.",
        "Dumbest game ever! A silly trick is enough to complete 20 stages in 5 mins. Trick -&gt; Just extend the start point to the direction which you cant cover by a whole traversal! Oh forgot to tell you, out of that 5 mins, 2-3 minute is just ads!",

        "Great idea to bring all the puzzles together into one app. The ads can get a little excessive at times, but you get used to it fast. The 10 puzzles for 25 coins is a very nice idea to encourage you to do more puzzles to get those coins! I haven't bumped into any problems with this game yet, so that's good! I entirely recommend this game for anybody who likes puzzles, novice or advanced! :)",
        "I love a lot of the puzzles on offer and the fact that you can earn plenty of coins along the way to use for hints when you get stuck. But some of the hints for some of the puzzles are extremely confusing to figure out, meaning I've gotten stuck with several of the puzzles and this is very disappointing for me.",
        "This game is alot of fun in my opinion and it has a whole bunch of diffrente games/challenges. But the ads are a bit of a problem and i don't know if this happend to you but it should me the same ad every time.",
        "I love this game! I love how there are so many puzzles and how new ones are being added all the time. I've read some reviews and I do admit that there is a lot of ads, but for the most part I don't really mind it. I don't know if its just my type of phone or not, but I can usually skip these ads pretty quickly. So yeah this is a great app! Keep up the great work!",
        "Love it! *UPDATED REVIEW * i would like to retract my first review as the game no longer works. I had gotten a far way into the game but now the game won't load or even open. Very disappointing.",
        "The game may be great. I don't know as I haven't played it yet. The first thing that happened when I started it up was that I saw an ad for Grindr. The game is a PEGI 3. This is an entirely inappropriate ad for a game rated like this. My 7 year old daughter would love to play these games but unfortunately I won't be letting her. Very cross."

        "The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can't even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!",
        "I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?",
        "Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!",
        "I love this game.  It's very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!"

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring.",
        "I think it's a fun game with some mechanics. One thing I don't lime is the fact that the guns seem to switch itself out I to a different weapon of a type I dont need out of nowhere. Which I hope can be patched and fixed soon. And the in app purchases are very affordable. Love the game but please fix the controls and make them more fluid."

        "Good little time waster, simple classic gameplay but puts its own unique twist on it.   Side note: I clearly played this game more than they thought anyone would as I have started getting repeated designs when I upgrade my spells xD",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.",
        "Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP."

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",

Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

If you can play you can manage fairly quick:D In the other hand, you need to collect these cards to make your cards better. But that just makes it feel 2x better when you win someone who has better cards than you:D",
        "Every i battle i go first thats why i didn't get +1  mana  and   i have 2 mana and i have 2 mana cards but my mana have 2 only and my cards have  4 mana  5 mana  3 mana and only my chance is my tower unfair to me and my enemy have many epic and me i have  only 1 and i open my many  chest i get common and rare i have all of my chest and i get i have and i have 100 gold and i want buy epic card but is 2k and i play  8 dmg lightning with 3 mana its only 4 not 8 dmg  and i battle i gave 42 health tower enemy but i go first and i dont have +1 mana and my enemy have unfair from me thats why i lose",

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",
        "this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",
        "Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I'm actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it's quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun",
        "Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway",
        "It's a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don't like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀"

Things you 400 of to upgrade, only come as 6 units or less a month which pushes you to buy 100$ packages to upgrade. WB is laughting at you!"

        "Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I'm very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it.",
        "I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.",
        "Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I've only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.",
        "I'm not quite sure what's happened to this game. It's very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android's OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it's going, now it's just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it's own update."

        "This is really hard. I can't buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible",
        "This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control's are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!",
        "If you are looking for a fun game, this is not one of 'em. It is so annoying. It gets me is mad that I've DELETED it twice. But... when you win the levels you feel like you have just met Jesus. Also, the first few levels are easy.",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars"

But its good,  I think what sets thia one apart from the other tap to play games is the frequency of bonuses. While granite not the best for your phones battery life. The bonuses come very frequently and add an appeal to the game I haven't found with others. This is day one though so keep that in mind. Good rates from me though on first play",

        "Great game! One can get a trophy in 5 days! Much difficulties 'd have be awesome: great idea to have make employees disappear but it happens only once in a session for me (do it more). I'm getting bored after 3 trophies, I was expecting more challenging after 2 or 3 trophies. Anyway they worked well on this game! Congrats",

        "I tried the beta and loved it, with my main hope for a way which you can backup your game so I don't have to worry about losing my progress. The developers came through and enabled CloudSave. I already love everything about this game and the addition of that meant and immediate 5 stars from me. Additional plus points for the cute games and being able to toggle whether you want poop.",
        "I love this game. I loved the first game a lot but was always super sad it didn't have a save function. But this one does! So you can save your progress with no problem. And there's so many areas of the house to fill up with stolen goodies. This game is awesome. 100% recommended!",
        "Really like this game however. It's been taking big amounts of coins off me in the past few days? I've purchased some of the coins etc. I leave the game with 2000+ coins to return to 800 this morning? I had the same thing a few days ago but thought I must've pressed some buttons wrong. But since it happened again, am not impressed with this. I've paid money for coins which are going missing? Shame cause its a fun game.",
        "I was so excited for this game since the first one is so fun. Sadly, this seems like it was made as a cash grab. Merely riding on the success of the last one, but changing a lot of the mechanics. For one, it costs more to bring the cats back, and it's more difficult to obtain coins. Also, forget about kiips unless you're willing to spend money, because they even changed the system of trading coins in for kiips, costing you more coins for each kiip you obtain via buying with coins. So if you're okay with all of that, it still has cute cats, fun little items to collect, and new rooms.",
        "It is cute and likeable. Love the YouTube video on the backstory. The cost sending the Klepto Cats Out is a little steep with the amount you make. Feeding, petting and bathing seems to do nothing. Having arthritic hands playing the games is bit difficult. Also why do you get dust cloud when tapping on something?",
        "100 PERCENT LIT GAME MAN.  I love the cute art style and all the puns oh I NEED THIS IN REAL LIFE. The only problem is that the 1st game was a little bit easier but that's the only problem like I said. Also cures depression."

        "I first got this game because it seemed interesting and whatnot, but I then completed the tutorial and went on to race other people but when I pressed the race button, I lost 20 energy but I didn't go on to race anyone or do anything else really. I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",
        "I love the concept of the game, but there are some major problems. First of all the sound has never worked and that's quite annoying. And then there is that glitch that happens a lot of times when you try to start a race and it uses your fuel but never starts, and that happens consistently. Please consider fixing the problems.",
        "I really wanted to like this game and it's a great game don't get me wrong but it seems like you can't really do anything in there without watching and ad or buy something. I hated how the are so pushy with micro-transactions!",
        "Too many adds and too many game load fails, loose upgrades all the time due to this. Of which there are too few to begin with. In my opinion this needs to run seamlessly too keep a player engaged as the graphics and game play are so incredibly basic.",
        "What did you do? Why ruin a game. Club gas bonus won't work. I've been racing the same three bots for days. Steals gas. Steals diamonds. Fix it! I'm close to uninstall we suspend real money you know?",
        "This app used to be amazing when it was still in early access. Now the app is covered in nothing but advertisements. It's stupidly excessive. It makes me think that you're not receiving enough money from your offers. Oh, and by the way, your offers are terrible. Nobody is going to buy things fairly priced. We want bargains, and less advertising."

        "First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕",
        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "You see I'm not the only person  who wouldn't recommend this game. Adds constantly and how could you play they game when it's so tricky to drive. I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I'm not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won't make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver.",
        "I thoughgbthis game was pretty good but there were too many add after every level, I completed the whole game in ten minutes there are only 16 levels! And it goes in a giant loop so it's pretty boring!"

After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",

I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",

After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",

        "I think is amazing you can even talk to the people that you serve to. I kind of want to make my own coffee shop now it seems fun. You're able to learn new recipes and coins for answering correct questions you get quite a bit of diamonds but don't use them too fast or you won't have any left.

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting"

        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game.I really do.It has brought me alot of joy. It's great fun and it's a guilty pleasure of mine. With that being said. Your Ranked Events are Not Excusable. I'm v7 so I have skin in the game as they say.. I will pass and when you stop your Ranked Events I will gladly change my review. No Excuse for a blantent cash grab you make a lot of money.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Great game, me and the family enjoy it immensely and we have all made our contribution, thank you. The controls in card battles on the phone are too fiddly, considering there is a lot of unused space on the screen: this would have been developed differently if it wasn't attempting to mimic the desktop version. Lazy! Is the \".. playing over WiFi...\" warning still relevant? Unlimited mobile data and 4g means many of us have as good a connection as fixed line. Love the game, thank you.",
        "This is an awesome game I play it be very day and I had two games I would always play now I don't even play them at all because this game is so awesome and I kinda play it to much.  But I did get my last account deleted for some reason I was mad and couldn't get it back so I had to create a new one",
        "Everytime I play a club arena game (free every 24hours) it will keep telling me i disconnected from the game while my Internet connection is fine. But when I play other normal arena games, it turns out fine. I find it very annoying because i have to wait 24 hours to play my favourite club games and it always disconnects, and it makes me mad. I hope you notice this comment and leave a reply... Please fix this... Thanks :(  Edit: It works fine now, thank you! :)",
        "Very fun game, my most played game by far but the major issue in this game is hackers. You get good and start to play the end gamers and realize 90% of them are bots with millions of coins and as soon as the game starts you are sent balloons to your side that cannot be activated until round 15+! It's frustrating to earn my coins legit just to have them taken by all the hackers and bots. Ruins the game when makers aren't doing anything about it.",

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem.",
        "Fun for a game or two here or there, other people seem to just roll out super powerful cards and wipe you out super fast. Too much of a frustrating game since NOT wanting to pull credit card out .....might be uninstalling it here soon."

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",
        "Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",
        "I like the concept of the game in and of itself however the controls leave a bit to be desired. I will tap on an area a few times trying to locate an item to no avail then get frustrated, tap again and whatever object will move and item revealed. This gets old very quickly please fix it.",
        "Overall, I like it. But I encountered too many unresponsive screens. I don't mind the penalty of watching an ad to skip an unresponsive level, but if I keep hitting completely unresponsive levels, that's not a fair tradeoff. If I'm too thick to figure it out, then that's on me. But if the level is just there to force me to choose an ad, that's not an enticement to keep playing.",
        "Maybe it's just my phone, Galaxy S7, but even when i knew what to do i had to tap over and over again to get a response. Seriously, tap the object 10 times and nothing happens then tap it an eleventh time and it reacts. Very frustrating. Spent most of my time just repeatedly tapping the object. Game is a good concept, but really bad controls."

        "Why advertise the game as \"free\" when it really isn't?  You can only get so far with the \"free ponies\" before you hit a pay wall that requires parents to purchase additional ponies to finish the quest.  The reason I say \"free ponies\" is that your child is subjected to a ridiculous amount of ads in order to play. The only way to get rid of the ads is to buy the ponies.  Even though my daughter loves the game and it's easy for a 5 year old to play, I had to uninstall it due to the ad content.  You really should be more careful who you solicit ads from for content designed for children under 8.",

        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I like this game very much but after updation it get worst. It's not fair that   we are playing with level 1 n some are playing with level 10 so disappointed now"

        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed.",
        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you've collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Some faults Overall a simple yet addictive game. Too many ads. The game ends and instantly an ad appears and your still hitting the screen so you automatically click an ad. I'm sure advertisers don't want to pay for a click that was purely a mistake. Also the leader board has people on 5000 points. I can't get past 78 after a lot of playing so I can't see 5000 points is scored without a hack."

You loose the coin doubling upgrade that you pay real money for. Why must I re purchase some I have already bought. Why does resetting my progress reset something I purchased with real money. I feel that is a little unfair and even from a premium purchaser is pretty jading, I really enjoy the game and will change to a 5 star once an answer is provided or it is fixed.",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "I remember back when this game would cost money on iOS. I would literally try to download every single third party helper app just to look for this game. Now that i actually have a phone, its free. I think this game is great for both relaxing and competitive play. And I am so hyped for the Odyssey. I check often to see if it is there. 10/10 would recommend this game.",
        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Echoing what many others are saying, the ads completely break this game. I understand I'm not paying for the game, so I don't mind being shown ads.  However the button to close the apps rarely function properly.  Instead of closing the ad it takes you to the download page of the ad being advertised. Update: I just had to sit through a round of a final fantasy game.  I wish you could rate below the 1 star.",
        "The game itself is fun and minimally challenging.  The graphics are lovely.  I felt compelled to give such a low rating due to the ads not clearing out upon completion.  I had to close the app and restart just to play the game again.  I would have purchased the ad-free version but if it's this buggy prior to purchase, I didn't want to get stuck with a pay version that I'm unable to clear out certain functions.  Maybe next time."

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "GREAT!... but the coins are a bit hard 2 earn thought the game is very addictive and the adds are not very frequent but they do appear on the bottom of your screen while playing thought there is a no adds purchase also the only purchase in the game the thing I like about the no adds purchase is that sometimes it will let you get it for 50% off so it is only one dollar instead of $2 (USD). The game has a lot of pens and I so far have unlocked a bit more than half and have played the game a lot of the game. But really needs an update.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "The games controls,  features,  graphic are really good and can't get your eyes off the screen once dart playing BUT, They are advertising companies that pop up there add moment we open the app... And whenever huge pineapple is on the move these things pop up please patch this immediately."

I REALLY miss the Chinese restaurant when I played that one I loved the doctor panda games and I really miss it.if you could can you PLEASE bring back the Chinese resturant.then I will love your games again😀😀😀",
        "Its a fun game but im very disapointes that you barely have anything to do they want you too buy so many things but it is a fun game but you can only make 2 dishes inthink maybe 1 but i was exspecting more from dr panda i love his apps i play them when i wanna play something but not harcore so if your fine with small content get this but if your looking for more i do not recommend this game but it has some good content you can season it however you want overall it was an ok game but i was expecting to be able to do more buts itis fun but if you want full content go to amazon underground or i think its free on this download toca kitchen 2 its great u make drinks as well thx for reading"

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "It would be better if they offered more free chips. Rather than bombarding us Every time we log in with there outrageous prices. Also a flush draw Every other hand and usually someone hits. Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",

        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics"

It would help us be less grindy. It would help with collection and able to get legendary easier plus monthly revenue. I would love that. Compare to MFF which is a lot more hectic, you guys a bit more generous. Just please don't put any paywall characters. Hated that.",
        "Fun game but currency is insanely expensive. I don't mind spending money but this game is ridiculous. So instead of me spending a little I spend nothing. I guess my wallet thanks you. It's also so hard to level people up... They keep introducing new characters I have to level up to keep up with alliance missions. Those are fun but I want to level up my other characters too!",
        "It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.",

Now that I've finished it I can say that I loved it: it's challenging, addictive and really well made! There are no ads pop-up, no obscuring ads or something annoying. The only time an ad is shown is when you want to recieve 5 hints and I think it's way better this way than to pay for them. As I was scrolling the reviews I noticed that the developer(s) answers almost everyone, is very nice, available and tries to resolve every problem that may occur (bugs, layout, useless complaints about the game :P): it's very rare to find someone like this! Keep up the good work! Would love to be challenged even more :P",

        "Good app but few glitches. One day I was playing against computer. It made a miraculous move of eating my pawn at a place where none of my pawn ever existed. Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team.",
        "I am very disappointed. I had this app when I had my iPhone and I loved it. I was obsessed with chess because of it. I got an android and I redownloaded it and I find out they now have a limit on the number of lessons you can complete if you don't upgrade. Total bs.",
        "the human opponents and the nice community are the only points to install this, but in this regard, those are damn wide ranged and very useful.  too bad, analysis isn't free and the trainer sucks. oh well, played here for HUMANS."

        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Addicting to play. The amount of ads is annoying and gets in the way of some of the controls sometimes, but otherwise it's a nice little game! I also like that it keeps track of stats and that you can deal just one card or 3 cards at a time!",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",
        "This is not actually a review its more like tips for those who like to play the game. I started playing on December and I already have a chopper. I could easily build a second one. The alpha bunker is the best place to get parts. Try using the traveller and selecting 5% chance to find a car part before you open the treasure boxes. Keep the best weapons for the  bunker.  Spots that appear on the main map that have timers are the only places you will find your body incase you die out there. If this is helpful I will give more tips on clothings.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and addicting, with patience.  My only complaint is that everytime i die,  which is often,  i lose all my stuff and can never find my body again.  I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",
        "I love the game. But seriously? You get 1 energy every 5 minutes and at minimum need 13 energy to get somewhere... Also why do you stop letting us watch ads? It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",
        "I'm done with this game... I have spent hours on it and despite being level 99 the game has stagnated. This latest update... Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",
        "check out my review from yesterday and their reply. for an investment you can develop faster, which means spend money. that's all you care about. I've been a loyal player from the very beginning and that's their response. I'll post a message on Facebook everyday and see how many people keep playing your game or even start playing it. lol. isn't it funny how they only have gameplay graphics and controls that you can see the rating for and not how happy users are. download war z law of survival. that game is much better and the developers actually listen to the people playing."

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",

Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?"

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "Very good game. Good graphics and easy game controls. I am a very good fan of Tekken and you give me a good game for my phone. The only thing is that is a little harder to get the caracters because you have to get 10/10 parts gems to get the caracters. In the controls if you can run without charging an attack and can give another single attack wile running thru the opponent it could be great. Other wise game is awesome thanks.",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh."

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I'm surprised this game scores so well. It's an exercise in drawing/scribbling, not physics. The puzzles are very one dimensional and most of them are solved by trial and error over thought and skill. It's a novel idea but given what else is available out there I wouldn't pay a penny for this game as it lacks innovation, originality and just feels very dated.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.",
        "Nice concept, but too frustrating for me. (Yes the ads are annoying, but you can pay to remove them.) The worst part for me is that I'm stuck because I can't seem to draw the shapes just right to beat some levels. There should be more leeway in the accuracy needed to win. Also, the hint on level 44 doesn't work.",
        "Hmm, what to say? I enjoyed it thoroughly (and I still am enjoying it). It was far more challenging than I thought, and I enjoyed being challenged by it. After all, that's what the game's about, isn't it? It's definitely a great game overall, and I'm looking forward to seeing how much further I can get in it. Also, it's really fun to just throw a massive block at a puzzle when you're confused. Sometimes violence IS the answer, it seems."

        "A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it's nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don't buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.",
        "Starts off ok but completely rigged to deplete your coins and to get you to spend money. Bow repairs and inconsistent wind effects among a couple of tactics. Also payed to upgrade my bow and sights and it was gone next time I logged in.",
        "Its a great game but with one major problem. Its very hard to concentrate when the guy we are playing against is making faces after faces to mess up your concentration. Put a limit or any punishment to such behavior and i will surely change it to 5 star.",
        "The game isn't bad however the customer service is poor and apparently there is a bug in the system. I completed a free cash reward by downloading another game and I was sent a message from Tapjoy saying congrats you have received the reward but I never did. I have sent out a request in game to get my reward but still have not received it.",
        "I really liked this game.  But after a while when I was playing there was message saying \"waiting for opponent's connection \" so I was waiting for a long time and then nothing happened.  But I lost ALL OF MY COINS!!!!!!  can you please fix this??  Whoever made this game.",
        "Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent's card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins."

        "Definitely enjoyed the game. The only issues I found with it is the amount of time it takes to upgrade a new weapon slot. The Success and Failure prompts in general linger on the screen for so long you're forced to tap the upgrade button hundreds of times before your new weapon slot is caught up to your current weapon. The area to tap in the field to is a bit unclear as well.",
        "Ok graphics for an idle game imo. Not super responsive to touch on my Note 8, sometimes have to double or triple tap or try to scroll twice to get it to move. Wish there was more reason to mine, but the combat is pretty fun. Satisfying sound effects in combat.",
        "I really like the game. It's lots of fun when I need to pass the time. I do wish that you could pause things when you get stuff in the store and you want to use it but maybe you want to stop the auto button at some point and have more control of the weapons. It would be nice if you could disable the auto button. I prefer having more control of the weapons unless I'm away from my phone but I haven't seen a way to pause it. Thank you very much! I love the game and will definitely keep playing.",
        "I THOUGHT this was an idle game. But no, you ACTUALLY have to actively be playing the game to make any progress. It really is a novelty idea if it was an idle game. Like keeps making money while you're away. Again you actually have to be active to sit through very, VERY long battles to make money. Make this an idle game and it would be more worth it. Until then, I for one am uninstalling.",
        "Fun game. Only thing that needs to be fixed is the enhancement aspect. It is inconsistent, as I've failed to enhance weapons despite having a 70-80% probability of success.",
        "Interesting, but not much i haven't seen before. Can be fun. Mildly addicting if you're like me and are easily led into following rhythmic things in a sort of mind blank."

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",
        "I HATE the vibration when u die I almost uninstalled the app bcuz of that. I also have a problem with pop up ads. I really like the game though",
        "Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.",
        "Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I'm playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.",
        "I think this game is very addictive. To all the people that say u have to many adds well i dont i can actually play the game without getting interrupted",
        "Defiently would recommend this to everyone i only have one complaint im trying to play games during the night and have fun and i like this game so addictive but it makes a vibrate sound everytime i die if u could remove that sound i would give this app a 5 star"

        "It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying \"Ready? Let's go!\" voice when the sound is on.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.",
        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Must be the shortest time I have had a game installed. Pace of gameplay is SLOW and I hate the voice of the game. So annoying! If I could skip the animation before and after a level it would be much better.",
        "Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished."

        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "People have low requirements nowadays. This game doesn't deserve a 4.4 rating. It feels good as long as I stay in the menu (even with the weird japanese mascot) but once the game loads it gets horrible. The camera angles are terrible, the cars feel like toys in the overscaled world, the car's softshadow is terribly aligned and the physics simulation is just mediocre. The whole game is just a mediocre clone of Asphalt 8, I don't understand why people choose an inferior copy instead of the original one...",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it",
        "It's good. But could you please add an \"are you sure you want to finish repair dialog box?\" I have wasted too many diamonds. You can even make it option (from the settings) for those who wouldn't like it.",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game."

        "need team voice chat and its super perfect.... anyone wants to try new battle royale? then try this... I think it might've been better than Rules Of Survival... this game is worth it..... it also lets you to shoot while your friends is driving a vehicle..well, only for duo or squad mode obviously....but what's more, you can actually pilot a helicopter..... nice...",
        "Great graphics with minimum config,controls are awesome  and it has dive button,can jump thru walls and climb windows,way better than the other survival games on phone,it has bullet physics! the only thing im concerned about is The lagging when shoorting from far distances,and id like to suggest a configuration for the graphics to adjust compatibilty . Thank you for this game 5stars! Your doing just great devs!",
        "I love this game and the devs reply to my requests in their official facebook page, thats awesome. One thing I wanna have here is voice chat. Definitely the best even low end devices can play this lag free. I recommend this. I don't know why they rate this so low but it's probably cuz it's not tha popular yet. Keep it up!",
        "I don't know why it got low ratings ....    I want to tell u thie guys..  ur game was absolutely great.... 125 players that impressive....graphics is good.. some minor buys ... plz reduce the sound of the heli...the most important thing is the render distance is soooooooooooo good.... i don't know how it's achived with in 180 MB .... I'm telling u this I really liked ROS....but not any more.....bc In here their is no such a lag and it can in any device... skill based  .. very good rendering distance.. the bullet drop is so realistic...jumping mechanism sooooo great and all this good things come with in 180 MB .. I love u guys.... GREAT WORK. keep it up....I really look up to the next update.......😘😘😙😙👌👌👌👌👍",
        "Hard to attack, easy to die. I already point the crosshair to the enemy, and when I start shooting, the crosshair miss the enemy and start to move around randomly, looks like I attack the ground, and end up died. Also, hard to find weapon and ammo. Your game is good, but not good enough. You are trying to fully copy PUBG, which is played on PC, while your game is Android-Based, hard to control. Hard to control. Easy to aim, but never hit, because the crosshair like to move around and land the bullet on the ground. Try to play Free Fire Battleground by Garena. Overall, Free Fire much better than yours. Uninstalled!",
        "there are some bugs, that i knew the player is in the building and in his/her phone, but in my phone the player just float in the air its good for me to kill that player, but its not good if the player was me.  fix the building.  add or fix some features like: 1. the distance of the safezone in the mini map. 2. after automaticaly open the door, please make it close automaticaly too. 3. make the control wheel just by move the camera not by the direction arrow. 4. foot step is just too small. 5. make a gun fire radar. 6. make the animation of the character more realistic.  its ok to me if the update makes the game become 500 mb bigger than previous version.  i love this game. its run nicely in my phone."

        "I really like the concept of the game I fun to play. But what I really find droubling its a pay to win type of game. Sure you get daily rewards and everything, but that still doesn't compare to the lack of coins you get. For example I recently reached lvl 11, and when I go into lobbies with people with high tier amor and weapons. I find It hard to get kills now. I really hope you guys can fix this in the further future",
        "I will u 5* if u increase the amount of coins every match and reduce price of weapons & armours. Amount of coins every match is so little that I can't buy a good weapon and also armor repair and also granede buying system is so pathetic.",
        "Its awesome, but the armor repair... really why? People are going to start hating that. Which happened to me and some others. Also add a friends list. Keep it up",
        "It's a good game u can meet a bunch of people around the world! Like slaughter not I met him and be careful what I say all right because I got blocked 2 times under 1 week lol bye",
        "I hate this You need to get report or find a mod. see in the chat a player keep calling me gay for 17 day I will 5 star it if you can do it",
        "This game looked cool from the start and it's amazing in the campaign but even level 1 is almost impossible I wonder what level 2 will be like but I just think they should add new grenades or jetpacks"

I want to stop deforestation and you need to , too! Hope this helped to put a stop to deforestation and to download this game  Bye😀",
        "I was forced to view 10   DIFFERENT ADS before ever even getting into this game.  I refuse to support money grubbers.  They (including Google) lack integrity are ruining this country.",
        "This is pretty sweet.  Its a great way to make stylized graphics  A lot of reviewers were complaining that it has a ton of ads tho, but you can get rid of them for 99 cents.  If you like this, dont whine just pay the piper or play something else.  Develepers have to eat, ya know???  If you want a free alternative, (or if you are curious about how this stuff works) i suggest looking into the open processing language.  You can learn to make your own cool stuff like this by finding a couple of algorithms online   Also, if you have a good graphics card in your pc/mac and you are interested in this stuff  check out touch designer.  You can make some really amazing realtime art  But seriously, support these developers if you like the program.  Its that simple.  99 cents is not much money!!  Ok luvya byebye",
        "If you love beautiful sights, you should download this app.You get to watch your creation from video! Also, as it has in the app pictures, there are different choices of design! The only bad thing is that there is kind of a lot of ads.But, that's fine! Its SUPER satisfying to me, and my sister! So, as you think, you should download this app.",

        "This game activitly makes me angry. I want to keep playing it but the longer I play the less accurate my ship becomes, eventually missing EVERY SHOT, EVERY TIME. It feels likes the longer you play the game the less effect your ship becomes. It's a fun game but seems like a pretty intense cash grab.",
        "Decent, not good. Enemy flags might as well not exist as they don't fight eachother. You'll end up getting swarmed by every ship that always go faster than you, no matter how much you upgrade speed. They ram You constantly dealing damage but then take no damage from when you ram them. They also aren't affected by friendly fire. You can't actually aim and the constant ads are very annoying.",
        "Easy to play game. Good graphics. Controls can be a bit fiddly, but not that hard to deal with. If playing solidly for a while (30+ minutes), the cannon firing timing stops working properly and all shots miss (except for the enemies!) - restart the game and problem resolves, but a frustrating little bug.",
        "Game is fun. Good for time killing. But the cannons seem having a serious accurate issue after played like 20 mins or so. Longer you played, the aiming will being more off to the shooting targets. It doesn't sound right to a game play design.",
        "This game is amazing. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played on mobile. Also, you don't need to spend any money! I got to a fully maxed out ships without spending a cent. One thing you guys should add is multiplayer and different style ships, maybe Viking or something. Otherwise great game."

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Great game and takes a little practice, although I don't get the automatic movement at the end of some throws. Is this the hackers people talk about. Its not always in the oppenents advantage but when it happens, the rock positons don't make sense. Anyone know why this happens. If they fix that I would give it 5 stars",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

        "Mars: Mars is a very fun game in which you take platforming and collectables to the next level. The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around.",
        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game."

All the \"good reviews\" are from cringey 9 year olds or their parents. Nick has never been good with game. ESPECIALLY in this dark age. Parents go get your kids shooty skies. Not this hunk of garbage. Also (my opinion)  Cartoon network is much better than Nick.",

But GOD this was horrible matchmaking sucks, physics are dumb, and it gets boring after 4 rounds, there's no ranks, earnings or nothing just two maps where compete with one person in the same position could be cool but needs some SERIOUS redoing. They should make it 4 player rounds where you can run round and throw knives and add ranks and earnables.",
        "This game has issues. The tutorial has a white background with white crosshairs making it nearly impossible to aim. You have to aim like 30 feet above your opponent and hope that you are lobbing the knife high enough to make it there. Sometimes I would somehow win a round without even throwing a knife. Other times I'd die in the first second of play after being hit 1 time but it would take me at least 3 hits to kill my opponent. Watched a video for a free crate and then the game went back to the startup screen like it was rebooting and i had to watch another to open it. Not very much to do either. Im out.",

I understand you'll need to make some money, but shoving them on every level can get on people nerves like mine. Make ads skippable and occasionally pop up every FEW levels and that will be fair enough. Game: 5/5 Ads: but why?",
        "Is a great game, but now the developer's getting greedy. 30 second ads between games, seriously? And also the points system is ruined too now that lose points from the main score when you hit an obstacle. The vehicles too are now more expensive than they used to be. I know you gotta earn but can you do it without alienating older players?",
        "Such a genious idea and a really fun gameplay. Ads are a bit annoying, but the developers have to make a living as well, just don't put then after every game. Maybe try to add more gameplay mechanics like air time or something for the beat changes or beat drops.",
        "Love it ! No listening music with game. I was waiting to play this type of game while listening my fav. Music. You guys deserves 5 stars.  Edit: I think devs are getting greedy. I am planing to rebuild it without ads strings in source for personal use if you guys don't remove ads.",
        "I've developed quite an addiction to this game. I love that you can import your music while dodging the obstacles. Great concept and great visuals. By far one of my favourite mobile games. Great job!",
        "This game is very cluttered: loads of motion blur and bright colours and shapes on black, also if you but an obstacle all your score resets but this makes it very hard to unlock or items. It needs to be simpler like audiosurf because it's hard to focus and controlling the car"

Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",

There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",

And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won't have a problem with the ads cause they don't show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I love the game, it's so addictive! Some of the levels are confusing, but most are super simple and super fun! One thing that is a little bit of a downer is how every time you want to play a new round you have to watch a 30 second add , which gets old when you want to play a lot, but don't want to pay for add free. But I would highly recomend this to anyone",
        "This game is so good but please get rid of some adverts. Whenever I click on somthing it always comes up with a long advert. Also, can you add a toutorial at the start, showing how to do each thing."

        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "Its a fun game where you actually get rewarded for watching ads. Multiplayer is a little laggy but its a fun game over all. Only thing i would like to see is the aftermath after your character either dies or falls out of the vehicle (level automatically resets after about a second after you die). Maybe even move around like you can in happy wheels, even if its just in single player mode. But overall a good game.",
        "So glitchy!!! Why?!?! I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this game because I'm already uninstalling due to how glitchy it is. It's very annoying and hard to play because of it. I'll try again in a month. Hopefully the devs take this seriously and work on fixing it or they won't have any players left!"

        "This game had a lot of potential which was litreally ruined by the props mechanic. I can bare with my prop being noisy but why do you have to make it seriously obvious? That's not even hiding at all. Also the health taken down when shooting wrong boject should be 1 and remove auto-shoot. Make it easier to hit props and remove the frigging emoji above the props.  This is more like a running simulator.",
        "This game is good. You should add more guns, coins to buy things with that aren't really expensive and one grenade launcher in every game. You should also add bigger maps and a lot more props to become.",
        "Great concept and overall pretty good, but hunters are heavily favored and it's pay to win. I wish purchases were just cosmetic instead. A few glitches such as the rotation being a pain (Samsung gs6).",
        "Fun game, can definitely play around on it for a while.  Definitely needs more maps, option to have the community create maps? Needs an in game chat, just cause. Also, way too easy to find props.",

Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it.

        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",
        "The problem is the friends system requires you connect via Facebook. For people that don't want to, or don't have Facebook, you're screwed. Please implement a way to add friends inside the game rather than through Facebook harassment.",
        "The game has the potential to be very entertaining however the constant crashes and app failure is very disheartening. Definite work needed to improve these issues, now its saying the app may not be optimized for the device. Why wouldn't it say that before downloading? Try again!",
        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards. You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

        "Like the game but would be better if resources would come back after a while, or you didn't loose your inventory when you died. Cant play for longer than two mins without dying again looking for wood. No axe, no pick, no wood.....  get killed. Lol",
        "It was very promising game. New update turns game very very hard and unbalanced. To much equipment cost for too little kill reward. Already spent money. But now without real money it is so difficult. No fighting chance at all. Please fix it",
        "This COULD be a great game, but it's a very much unbalanced. Your resources on you area NEVER grow back, so you must travel... I get why that is, but it takes 10-30 minutes, unless of course you want to use energy. You get 100 energy and it takes too much energy to fast travel at the pace that energy is replenished. If you can get around that, and build a few items, tools, weapons, etc. It seems like the game finally gets going but if you die from the 5-10 attackers, you lose ALL of your stuff on you. Everything I've mentioned can of course be fixed by spending a TON of money, but beware, everything has durabilty, and once broken will disappear. So you will always be spending money. CAN'T THERE BE ONE OF THESE GAMES THAT AREN'T MADE OUT OF COMPLETE GREED?",
        "Finally figured out this game is NOT a beat-'em-up. At the beginning, you need to RUN when something comes after you, whether it's one of the damned, a bear, or another player. RUN.  Once you realize that, it's pretty great. Gather, sneak, craft, and build your stronghold. Eventually you'll be able to kill those bastards who came after you with a sword when you were naked.",
        "I really like it, but such a slow start, after the initial offering of goodies i just stumble along with constant death, no weapon, lose my bag every death. Very frustrating."

Because Blitz Brigade is packing major heat in this over-the-top (and over budget) online FPS war fest!<br><br>Put on your game face as one of seven highly skilled and totally badass classes and team up with other players to blast your enemies into the ground&#x2026; Then dig &apos;em up so you can blast &apos;em again! <br><br>Enter an outlandish alternate history where the world&#x2019;s military leaders are actually sensible people, and the warring forces of the Axis and Allies realize that a world war would literally be the worst thing ever.

I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "I don't understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed.",
        "Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved."

Then you get a message assuming you dont understand how the game works and a thanks for understanding.  So the poor customer support is what got this game it's 2 stars from me and the prize screws.",

Great job team! To everyone out there.. if you don't download this game your nuts cuz you have no idea what your missing.  Have unlocked the full island but still need room for all the new Dino's available plus buildings PLEASE ADD MORE ISLAND OR SECOND LARGE AREA!!!!! THANK YOU :)",

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it even went onto their Facebook page and explain but there was still no fix. I give this game 2 stars. No point in trying to advance if problem is not fixed.",

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog.",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it.",
        "Whenever I open it, it crashes immediately, probably due to the quality of the graphics. Please maybe downgrade the graphics as a default option, and have an option in the game to change it to a higher quality. I use the Samsung Galaxy S5, not the most powerful thing in the world but I'm sure you can fix it."

        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",
        "Edit: Fix the controls! Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",
        "Lack of game play is what gets me. Don't get me wrong, it's a smart tactic. Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "I was so excited for the new update because it contained a cloud save feature... But guess what... The cloud save doesn't work at all.. The developers just want to draw attention so we could act silly and buy the game for decent 8 to 10 hours of gameplay then if we want to change our device,to be totally left out without choices but not to install the game and cry for the lost money... ADD A DAMN CLOUD SAVE!!",
        "It was a good game. Too bad it doesnt open now after the update. It says something below the logo screen and then dissapears too fast you cant read it. And when it goes to the gear connecting thing to try to connect it crashes.",
        "Can you guys pls fix the game because when I started to play then while its loading THE GAME GOT CRASH! The oldest version work for me but this version it didn't work. Thx to read this."

        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy.",
        "This game would be awesome if it matched you with people equal to your level but it doesn't. So I spend more time trying to get to the higher levels and not able to upgrade equipment. Of course you could always purchase money but I'm not big on doibg that!"

The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",

Now the game doesnt function when you try to start a run and the problem even persisted to my home screen before I closed the application.",

Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don't want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?"

It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",

Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",

        "This game keeps crashing to the home screen without warning,same problem with Blossom blast saga.Problem started before few days ago,since I updated both games.This problem keeps happening with android kitkat. Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "At level 558 I quit this game like 2=3 years ago... Now I don't even remember how to defeat spiders etc... Thought it would be fun to start over from scratch... But of course in these games not even a chance...  Great fun... NO",
        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

        "Hasn't even been 10 seconds into the game before it shut down 🤣 - I thought it would be different for me as I have the S8+. Obviously NOT. The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn't much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.",
        "Let's be honest here. The concept was very creative and unique, but the game was very poorly designed. The slide is not smooth and   feels very unstable, I wasn't able to enjoy playing the game. The graphics are very low and the game itself is slow. Apart from that the idea was very well thought of but I feel you should have added more time and professionalism into the whole design, the game has potential.",
        "One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don't really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...",
        "It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.",
        "It's hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I'll be doing fine but it'll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I'd love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks.",
        "People... There are little mistakes that every game has. There is sucky parts of this game such as ads between every time that you die but the concept of the game is to not die so I kinda guess it gives you a goal. This is an awesome game but it won't work for every device. There are some BAD comments that may discourage you but trust me my friends... Try it.. It doesn't work, there is always the uninstall button for you."

And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can't use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.",
        "Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don't work!.... I'll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.",
        "I'm very unhappy!! Since the update my daughter can no longer play with the babies I bought, only the free ones. She is constantly bugging me to buy them again, but since I have already purchased them I do not think I should have to. Please may I have a full refund so I can purchase again or better yet fix the problem, then I can give 5*",
        "Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.",
        "Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn't recommend this app because of that... it's just stealing my money..",
        "Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!"

        "Fun best game, easy to play and all i can say is fun as hell. I guess i could be more fun if you add some gore effect or blood splat. Super fun if you can see the bullets hit them.",

I always make sure I download game whenever I upgrade to a new phone...it doesn't bother me to start all over bcuz I could play this game from beginning to end everyday!!  Game actually allows u to start where u left off but many times I choose to start from beginning..i wonder if there's ever going to be a sequel to swamp attack...swamp attack 2, swamps revenge??  Lol...i HOPE SO!!!"

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "I have been after a card game to play on my mobile that really gets my fantasy spin on things. Legendary plays smoothly and is not full of adverts.  So far my progression has been absolutely fantastic.  Having played other mobile based card battlers, I have to say this one is a solid five stars.",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work."

        "Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.",
        "Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.",
        "It really is fun but, the scores you have to get to unlock new balls are very difficult to get mostly the exact numbers .over all I love the game would recommend this to a friend. It is very addicting especially if you have to wait for something.👍",
        "It a great game but I have a small issue.    Nearly every time I open the app it comes up with this pixilated, almost, screen for about 30s. (I have a screen shot of it) it didn't do this when I first downloaded the game so is this something I've done wrong, my phone or the programmers?

        "I enjoyed this game for about the first ten levels. It's fun and almost educational about civil engineering practices. However, after the first ten levels it becomes an infuriating cacophony of balancing your bridge on rocks and mountains without anchor points and hanging your bridge from hot air balloons. Levels become so frustratingly impossible that you are forced to watch the videos for hints to get enough stars to progress.",
        "This game is simply great. It may have adds but they are expected in a free to play mobile app. The adds are easily controlled and aren't annoying at all as they can be easily closed and come in moderation. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are cool and it's very fun and addicting. Perfect to pass time. The developers done a great job, hope for me great games made big these guys.",
        "Good game. Too bad steel wire is so expensive it's almost never useful.",

Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game.

For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different. You can reword weapon for rank, rank 5 win something, rank 10, 15, 20...",
        "Fun game. Would have hated it higher but when I got to 8th or so level, the levels ran out. Its said more episodes coming soon for several months now. Alot of waiting for developers to develope.",

        "I'm very crazy about the cover fire .... But sometime when I play it with data connectivity the game will automatically turn off and I loss my all progress in that game and finally I had to need it start again ..... Developers plz solve... its really an issue between me and the game fun",
        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers"

        "Dont know where my last review went so im writing another...  This game is the worst game for ads i couldn't even play the game because the ads were constantly spamming me.  So ive had to uninstall. I'll never know if this game was good or not because i never got to play due to ads!  People are saying  'pay to remove ads if you dont like it '   well we should have to pay to remove ads on a free game.. whats the point in saying its free when really it isn't because you have to pay to remove ads in order to play the game!!!",
        "Good game but enough with the ads. Way too many and way too long. The ads are longer than the game play. Ine ad was over 30 seconds long. You guys obviously do not read these comments or reply to any of them. This could be a great game.",
        "The ads are excessive. There is an ad at the bottom of the screen at all times, and after every single attempt at a level, I was getting an unskippable 30 second ad.

        "I love this game, it's simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I'd really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the 'I' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.",
        "I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It's amazing all around.  It's adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven't noticed any bugs either. The developer's done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it's still fun. Can't wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!",
        "This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she'll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she's tried. I'm really happy i found this game!!",
        "This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don't have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There's nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I'm level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)",
        "I really love this game, but if you don't put an update on Clumsy Ninja I'm going to uninstall this awesome game. In the next update will you please fix the part when you touch the story book then it tells you the pictures are still locked? If you put this in the new update anytime, I will start to love this game like I did before. One more thing.... If this helps.... I really really really love this app!!!",
        "You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this"

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.",
        "This game is horrible. THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS GAME HAD ONE JOB IT WAS TO MAKE A GOOD GAME AND THEY FAILED!!!!!! Don't download this game. The controls are horrible, the background is horrible and, the landings are not possible because of the background and the controls. UNINSTALL this game you are just wasting your time playing this game! UNINSTALL!!!!!!!!😲😠😾"

        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great game with good potential. I love it. But there are still some minor bugs the car baler somtimes acts weird. And the dismantling process sometimes goes reverse. And then there is the part of collecting building materials. It is too hard and we need to be able to get building materials from elsewhere than the scrap cars. All of them including wood, bricks, and concrete. I am looking forward to the car repair function.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "If the devs keep working on the balance of the game, it could be quite interesting. It is currently very grindy and slow. The fact that vehicles come LESS often at higher levels is bizarre, frankly. It completely ruins the balance of the game, so I frequently have nothing to do while I wait for the next car. Cars should come frequently, to encourage players to choose wisely. As it is, energy is meaningless because there aren't enough vehicles to spend my energy on."

It is hard for new players to gain the no. of friends achievement if there is a maximum number of friend requests you can make as most of the older players will have used them and the newer ones cannot get the final level of that achievement on their own. So please remove it. Plus the guild treasury needs more of a purpose then just guild v guild. I have lost almost 1000 goods to the guild treasury for quests as i do not do guild v guild nor am I interested in participating in guild v guild.

I know you can not win them all but come on now with only a small amount of energy you have to make the most of your turns. Like I said loved it at first but became very irritating",

        "The game was addictive and fun until you get to Miami. 100k to unlock that level is absurd and unrealistic. Its to hard to make that kind of money playing and now its just playing the same level over and over trying to get enough. Now its boring!! I'm disappointed, I really enjoyed playing until that point.",
        "Was a great game until I got to Miami level 19 now just bloody stupid & waste of time. I went to 4 straight auctions couldn't buy a unit because competitors bid more than what the units worth how are you suppose to level up & move on when the designers of the game make stupid unrealistic flaws in the game no bidder is going to bid in real life on items they can't see or know are there so why put this into the game? Fix this issue & I will adjust my review accordingly!"

        "Stupid Wont let me use extra lives. Force closes randomly while in the middle of it and sometime when it starts make u miss your chance then tried to use extra life. This app sucks needs to fix force close parts. Screws me out of chances",
        "This game is so much fun to play independently and with a group. The only problem it will sometimes lag but I'm sure that's being fixed. My only two suggestions are that you can add a place where u can watch back old games because the host is so funny it would be a shame to miss out. Another would be to create a version where it is a group mode that you can play between a group of friends for fun. (Separate from the live game) Overall this game is amazing and it's amazing that there is a game everyday😊",
        "The questions are very hard!! It's fun even if you don't win! But it would be nice! Sometimes the game lags and boots me out of the game. Once I got the answer correct but the app still eliminated me! I wish they would rotate the music. Wow the pots are growing!!! Why not instead of getting extra friends for extra lives, have 3 or 4 chances to get the correct answer?",
        "The game is constantly lagging, freezing and glitching. Also do not like that I cannot change my answer even when I still have time left. The platform needs to better support the number of players that are logged on at the same time, or have a limit to the number of players so that it doesn't freeze. Cannot play properly.",
        "To many glitches. Kicks me out when i have correct answer marked before time is up. Every time I have played its eliminated me as soon as the question comes up and ill have the right answer in right amount of time left. Wanted to like this game but its frustrating to get kicked out every time Id like to play."

        "The level design is fine and the graphics is nice to look at. I like that it isn't always a course of multiple levels, but individual levels, it fits better for an on the go game. My main problem is with the controls and physics. You can hit a wall straight on and instead of bouncing back, like you would expect, it slows the ball down to a stop and just roll it a little to the side, these unpredictable physics make it hard to determine where your ball will go. And the camera controls is quite annoying, the swiping is way more intuitive and natural but is way too slow for turning 180 degrees. The button controls is too fast when trying to precision your shot.  These issues are, for me, a deal breaker and is the reason why I will not be playing this again. Though the gameplay was enjoyable when working. I have been looking for a casual golf game, and hoped this could be it, based on the more than stellar reviews.",

The only problem that stops us from giving this game a 5 star rating is a small bug, on the fact that he can't get through to arronville which upsets and annoys him when the game crashes, please fix this problem as it would be a brilliant help to us.

        "Really enjoying this. Difficult but not annoying. I recommend buying the basic starter pack which gets rid of necessary ads, but you can still watch ads to get more coins etc.. Which is smart I think. Gameplay is pretty fun and responsive. Upgrades don't feel unattainable. Definitely one of the better games on the play store",
        "There is a sudden difficulty spike in this game around level 20. Even if u have the best ship and weapons ur no match for the hordes of enemies. This is not right. Even after spending money the developers dont want you to win in my opinion. Dont know whats the logic.",
        "After paying to \"remove ads\" there are still just as many ads is there ever have been. This game is a sham and a scam! It appears the developers are just greedy and will steal from you in any way possible. Sad, because it was fun for a while.",
        "It's almost nothing without buying coins, u cant even win normal difficulty without ads and purchasing coins, how r we supposed to upgrade our weapons when every map gives u only around 200 and u need 20000 after a while for only one upgrade????!!!!!! Its graphic and gameplay is really good but like I said no progress in winning after a few maps",
        "It's simply too difficult to see when your finger is in the way.   Is there a fix? No.  Fun game. Too hard for my taste.  My $0.02",
        "Stuck on level 32. Theres no way past this level without spending some bucks (crazy prices). Hate the fact that there is no other way, but to  pay for the best upgrades."

I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "The ads are very annoying and I have lost interest in playing  the game anymore. I have to start over for each play. Ad won't let me continue. Someone has Really messed this game up. Just fire their butts and send them down to the river swamp. No need for them to be in the public when they can't leave well enough alone.",
        "I think the game is great. I love Mahjong. I'm unhappy that I paid 1.99 to stop the ads but when I collect my 2,000 coin bonus I still have to watch an ad to receive the bonus. I will not be paying 1.99 next month just to still have to watch ads.",

        "This is an idle game with effort and pretty fun writing, with a lot of ways to feel rewarded without cracking your wallet. It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "The fast pace of the game keeps you hooked.  They don't throw ads at you but certainly make them available for great benefits.  It's not clunky at all which makes it easy to pick up and play a couple minutes here and there.  It's a ridiculous concept of making money off taxis/fares, heck I'd move to the cab driver profession if I made &gt;$500 million on one fare... but funny and fun nonetheless.",
        "I really like this game a lot. I'm not usually into these idle games, but from all the ones ive tried. Ive enjoyed this one the most. Other then the occasional slow down, it mostly runs great. And the model for ads is very very fair. If you decide to watch and ad, you always get some kind of reward out of it. But its completely optional.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Huge battery drain compared to any other game i have played including the new tekken and sims mobile games which are much more graphical. Will sometimes lose game progress when you completely close the app (so not running in background). Taxi's occasionally get stuck on buildings or vanish off screen completely. If it wasn't for these issues it could be a much better game.",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like."

        "Good nostalgia, awesome graphics but needs better execution. Allow optional interactivity with friends, for example. The main point of using a smartphone is connectivity. Make earning anything easier, this will increase the replay value. Your game will become popular by word of mouth, I tell you. Don't make it a quick cash grab. Think about how you can keep the game afloat instead of having to scrap it and start anew if it fails.",
        "I paid for the starter pack which says it will remove the mandatory ads but guess what, ads are still there. Please do something about it and I will change my ratings.  Edit after reply* wow not even an apology for someone who paid. Kind sir, then please at least let your consumers know that there are actually 2 kind of ads instead of just simply stating 1? No Tom dick or harry will know that unless you state it. Good day.",
        "The only issue i had is the back button when tamagochi sleep. It make auto-wake state when i push the back button. It would be nice if even i push the back button tamagochi still sleeping instead wake up and also option for how long they sleep like 4,6,8 hours. I'll change the rating after the back button issue has fix. Btw the game is good, you should add adventure or something like that.",
        "I have never written a review of an app/game before but I just had to for this one. This game is amazing! Being a 90s kid I had the original tamagotchi and I was addicted to it back then as well. The game is beautiful and brightly colored. I find myself wanting to check on my \"child\" often lol. This is definitely something I would recommend for anyone looking for an addictive and fun game ❤",
        "This game is cute and fun. My 2 year old son enjoys it and I also play it too because its so adorable and reminds me of the old tamagotchi. The only conplaint I have is that it says the ads will go away if you purachse something but there are still ads if I want to speed up the sleeping and other things. Maybe there should be an option to pay and remove all of the ads permanently.",
        "I did a YouTube video over this app. Overall Tamagotchi Forever is fun. But ads and lack of things to do made this app a miss opportunity for the creators. I do like optional ads. But the ads at the top and in between screens are lame. Also for an app like this cosmetics are the perfect thing to add, but they limit the costumes to about 3 each character. Another nice thing that would've been cool to see would've been decorating your house & visiting friends. These other things would've made the app great."

I dont know if anyone else has experienced what my 7yr old son has but on loading the game he was shown a flashing image of a man getting stabbed in the eye.

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I've really enjoyed reading All the Wrong reasons.  The author is very talented, a true story teller.  As I was reading I felt like part of the story I was so enveloped in the lives of the characters they were alive and real. I was sad when the story ended wanted to keep reading.  I was overjoyed when K. I. S. S.  came out by that very sane author who transported me to a whole new world yet again. I look forward to reading more from this amazingly talented storyteller!!",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked."

        "This game is great! Though there are things I would change about the new race mode and some things in arcade mode. For example, instead of having to pay a dollar USD to cut the rope tire, why not pay a thousand coins to get rid of it for the next 5 or 10 times it needs to show up, and have us pay the dollar to get rid of it for good. And in arcade, if you accidentally missed your reward,why not have it double the next reward rather then keep the amount the same all the time, otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing besides those two things, I love it ^^",
        "Great visuals, smooth physics, and addicting Gameplay. Great game, my only thing I'd change would be the end-game knives, past 10k all the knives kinda suck, and have awful 'flipability', making it pointless to save up for anything above 10-15k. If you added a better variety of knives into the game this would be a 5 star.",
        "The climbing game is the only thing I hate, it's such BS. My knife will slide and hit a branch after it went into the wood. That's not supposed to happen. But overall great game.",
        "Please devs, read that. You are losing the point here. The game should be good and exciting so we can support you, and not irritating and frustrating. The knives always hit with the sharp part and it is not always that it hang on the wood. It seems it is a matter of luck/random result of some algorithm. Now if that matter of luck wasn't enough, we need to dodge an annoying tire, or just pay to have it removed. Instead of pay because we like the game we should pay to play? Put a price in the game and all knives available to buy with the game money and I buy it. Let it as it is now and you won't ever see any cent from me, not even from ads because I only play it offline. I refuse to watch any ad even if I could increase a reward in 10x.",
        "IM SICK OF YOUR SHIITY UPDATES JUST TO GET SOME CASH OUT OF YOUR USERS! this Game ran smooth on my Phone but after all those updates it just stops responding. and u should ask before logging in Google Games👎👎👎",
        "Not perfect but it's really good, hate the tires though, not willing to pay any amount of money to remove them. It would be better if after 1-5 thousand score on race, the tire would be removed or maybe throw a knife 10 times through the tire and it would be gone. Kinda silly to pay to  remove something that would make for much better gameplay if the player could play the game and earn it gone. (Mostly doing this for the 500 coins but this is an honest review)"

I don't mind the cost for some extra packs. I am having issues with being able to watch videos for hints, though. Just gets caught at 5he loading screen.",
        "Update destroyed the UI. It was hard enough to play one handed as it was, now the smaller icons and narrower sidebar make it even more difficult. Also, longer item names like atmosphere now get truncated at the edge of the screen because the sidebar is too narrow. Either add an option to switch back to the larger layout, or add a left-handed mode with the UI mirrored horizontally. Basically unplayable while multitasking now.",
        "Fun game and addicting but pretty pointless. Please add internationalization!  I used the original one as a vocabulary discovery app thanks to the availability of multiple languages. I would have expected at least one other language for a \"sequel\"!  Otherwise it's really just a time waster (which is fine, but way less cool)",
        "LOVE this game! I honestly didn't ever expect an update and I was fine with it. The game was perfectly complete but I'm really happy they revisited some things because there were a couple things that were a bit wonky, like Liquid and Solid never worked like you'd expect them to. Solid+Water= Ice but Ice+Liquid doesn't = Water. I'm not sure what exactly they changed, but I'm just glad that the developers are still involved in it.",

Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",

However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

The game is beatable and fun even without going through the longer \"optional\" ads (for which the rewards are fair)",

Anyway, this game really helped me see new aspects of topics that I hadn't seen before, and it's a very interesting concept. Cheers to the developer :D.",

        "Not your average political decision-making game! The storyline brings a high amount of intrigue to the game, and I can positively say I'm about as addicted as I would be to a great book. I can't wait to find all the endings, highly recommended!"

        "This is honestly the best game for anyone who is going through something tough.  One of my favorite parts is when the speech bubbles pop up from the plants and animals.  They always tell you exactly what you need to hear.  The sentences are not related to the game at all, but at the same time it makes it so nice!  I haven't written a review before but truly, the most beautiful game i have ever seen, and I am so happy that I downloaded it.  It's pleasing to the eye as well as the mind.  It's healing in some way.  Thank you for making this game and making my anxiety a little easier to deal with.  Whoever made this has such a kind heart❤️",
        "All of this is absolutely amazing. I have social anxiety, and the first time I played this (which was minutes ago) helped me so much. I could simply get lost in my own little world- or should I say oasis- for a while so I can calm down. Also the little messages are very sweet, and I love the artstyle! All in all this is a fantastic game, I wholeheartedly love it. C:",
        "I like it a lot but I only wish I could turn off the SFX for tapping and leave the BGM and ambient noises (like rain from the weather and rain cloud) on. Other than that, the ads are subtle and unobtrusive, the bonuses reasonably helpful for the cost, and the shop is nice (but unnecessary! You can enjoy the game without it. )",
        "Ads, ads and more ads. Rated family friendly but ads include electric cigarettes and lottery. Not exactly family friendly. The game is based on tapping to gain hearts to buy things to gain more hearts. Neat except it's nearly impossible to avoid the ads, which seem to be nothing but electric cigarettes and lottery ads (more than 6/10). Even when you're trying to play without ads, you will inevitably tap one of those inspirational messages from one of the animals or plants and launch an ad.",
        "I really love the inspirational phrases that pop up randomly. It really changes my mood when I read one. The only thing is that I wish this could have a journal section.

        "Will start with that, the game itself is great for little kids. But is full with ads, which we all know that the developers need it, but they should think also about the kids. 1-2 years kids don't understand how get out of all this ads, which are popping up every 1min!.About the pay version (Ads free). We pay for it, but I would like to see more random popping stuff. For example the category with the animal is like 8 or 12 animal in total. The category with the numbers also is around 8. After all this is just suggestions, no bad meaning. But as parent I would like to see this game even more creative and helping our kids to think also creativity. Good game for kids!",
        "I am absolutely livid!! It's one thing to have ads, hey it's a free app that needs to be financed somehow...what's unacceptable are age inappropriate ads. This app should be pulled. The very first ad was that of a match game matching deal people. My son is 18months old. Thanks app is rated 5 and under. My 5 year old should not see deal people as course of play. Pull this app now!!",
        "Ads are everywhere in this game. For a 2 year old who doesn't understand  how to exit out of the ad is frustrating. Ya, you have the ad free option for $2.99 but when I searched for \"free apps for 2 year olds\" this shouldn't come up in the search. Apps for toddlers should never have ads in them.",
        "Loved it, not too overpopulated screen, ability to remove ads, each completion gives you a few seconds of bubble and balloon bursting. It doesn't take too long to load either  Cons: I feel like it could read out what each shape is as you slot it in, it also doesn't honour the phones back button (good or bad depending on if you want your child to be able to move between apps themselves)",
        "Such a good game! My 1.5 year old loves it and it was so amazing watching him learn how to put the shapes into the correct places. There's about 9 categories I think so it doesn't ever get boring- you can choose from many different shapes. The only complaint is the ads are getting worse -  it used to be just at the bottom where my son could accidently press it, but now they actually appear overriding the game and you have to watch for 30 sec and can't exit... Hard for a child to understand he has to wait to get back to his game. If it gets any worse my rating will go down.",
        "My son likes this learning puzzle game but it is I credibly frustrating after ever single puzzle he does an Ad pops up playing a video of a new app. I have to constantly take it away to exit off and back into the game."

        "Used to be five stars now 1.  FIX THE DOWNLOAD ISSUE WITH THE SPRING UPDATE!   Listen to your customers and at least acknowledge that you might be working on solving the problem.  Not responding at all is horrendous customer service.  Will be deleting the game shortly if not fixed.",
        "Sometimes I would give it a five star other times 4 star. Good number of challenge keys per visit to none challenge sites. As few as two visits needed for one visit to challenge site in final level of challenge (requiring 25keys). Love the two modes for cards of fate. No time limit but fewer tries works great if you write down what you find. It surprisingly has improved my timed play of this mini game. There are getting to be too many items and NO search functions to facilitate where to find a particular item, what collection items belong to if someone wants it and you don't want to send it anonymously (case if you send a requested item) and don't send it from the gift bar. One of the better hide and find games.",
        "I changed my previous rating. There are so many glitches, especially with new events  and support doesn't respond to requests. I haven't gotten totem bonuses for three days and new event is nearly impossible at times to find bunnies and objects. This used to be my \"go to\" stress reliever but now it just creates more stress.",
        "Instead of relaxing me this game stresses the hell out of me. New bunny location is extremely hard to find the 🐇. And the time limit is too short. I know im wasting my time writing this cause I've seen a lot people complaining about it and nothing is been done. Will be unistalling if it doesn't gets fix. Good day",
        "The main complaint is that some tasks have insanely short timers, like for the new event where you have to find optionnal stuff that's really well hidden as well as the usual pack of items that usually takes the whole timer to find. Great game, bases itself too much on money dropping.",
        "The only thing I don't like about the game is that by the time you search a couple of places (depending on ur level) is how long you have to wait to get enough energy up to search again. Depending on what you want to search it can take up to an hour or more to get the requirements. Other than that I really like the game."

        "An advise read it plz and writ for it if u like! The game is awesome , nyc and funny and chalanging too. but i think it could b more intersesting if we get lifes in it. for example my high score is 22 and i never get on 22 again i remain on 16 or 19 but if i could hav one lyf there i shall surely reached my high score or more...\"thanku\"",
        "So basically I just sat down to play stick hero. And my goal at the end of the day is to reach at least 100 cherries. Same today. But as I start playing I don't find any cherries on my path. \"That is weird!\" I say to myself. I try to double tap to get cherries it doesn't allow it. So I go to the home page to see how many cherries I have ..... the icon isn't even there???   Despite that concern, love the game its so much fun ! For u people who are looking for a fun catchy game to play here is the perfect game. Please download so much fun and a great game to put on your device!",
        "Awesome but I have some ideas This game is awesome and it never ceases to make me happy. But buying new characters is kind of pointless. Developers you probably won't see this or even care if you do but I think that when you buy new characters the characters should have abilities that you use once a round for free or you can refresh the ability using cherries.",
        "Amazing game...nice timepass.. I love this game.. It is good for kids and I enjoy playing this.. The game doesn't hang and I can't just stop my fingers writing the review.. In the first level o thought it's going to be hard but to my surprise it was easy and smooth... And I loved.. For hours I kept playing it untilthe battery was dead!! The other parts of the game are nice as well especially the voice one!!! Do download😊",
        "False Advertising I mean, in a way. The help example is slower than the actual game. The platform grows faster and the guy runs across instead of the leisurely stroll in the 'tutorial'. Maybe have an option for speed, slower or faster depending on what the player feels like tackling that day. Still a fun game, but come on. We're not all finger-ninjas.",
        "Simply but satisfying It's a very addictive game. I think the little character(s) are adorable. The only complaint I have is when you grab a cherry and then you fall because the stick isn't long enough-in my opinion you should still get the cherry put in your \"bank\". I also like the watermelon level."

It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",

You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement."

        "This so freaking awesome, a woo hoo maker! I kept mumbling awesome, awesome, when i passed a car. And this is first time i'm very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven't sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!",
        "Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.",
        "There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.",

        "Love this game addictive and lose time playing it. But anyone else having problems logging in? When i try to log in it just sits on the loading screen (on 100%).. Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",
        "I'm really enjoying this game, it has enough to keep an old dungeon crawler like myself interested and the payment system is varied enough that you have to be strategic there as well. My only issue is that after today's update the game shuts down on me as soon as I log in. It was doing the same thing before I downloaded the last update package, stopped after the download but is now back to the immediate shut down post-login. Hopefully this is temporary and the team can get this fixed. But great job, guys. Looking forward to seeing the future of LoD."

Sometimes it will double move when you've only pressed to move once and you can only undo one time so you're basically screwed. I got up to over 447 thousand and it did this and ruined it all. Then it plays loud ads.",

        "The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been \"hacked\" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)",
        "I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It's not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you've got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable."

        "03-23-18: HOLY SHEET THE SCI-FI UPDATE IS CRAZY AMAZING! Outerminds has done it again! I wish they made more unique celebrations (like SciFi) other than Christmas or Valentine's in the future, such as Easter or even a Video Game Mashup update. It is time to rewrite my review!  So far, it's my favorite time-waster in my device. Never utilizes the Pay2Win paywalls for the most of the time (It's one of the best non-Pay2Win apps in the era of Pay2Win), and never crashes at all! Bugs aren't frequent! There are easy ways to save Bux and Brains in the game, which gives almost every player the opportunity to customize without any problem.  The game is hugely customizable. It's like being a home designer and a Tuber at the same time. There's lots of different customization options for your room, Tuber, and stuff. I also love to switch to a certain theme during events like SciFi or Valentine's Event.  And next, the videos. You can name your videos whatever you want, and you can select a combination of genres. You could make hilarious titles like \"PewDiePie Plays His Game\" or \"Edgar The Rapper\". And then you can pretend to act them out.  One of the best parts of the game is that there are almost no annoying popup video/banner ads, unlike in most games I've played like Vlogger Go Viral. The only way to view them is to simply go for a free shipping boost by watching an ad (which does not interrupt gameplay. Watching ads is also in Quests too, and it's fine as well.)  I like the Puggle minigame as well. It doesn't make the game feel boring as it can help boost shipping time while being a playable Pachinko with Edgar and Maya.  The game's community is also very cool. No cancerous fights or something, many players of this Tuber Simulator mostly focus on hatching Pixelings, participate in room contests, and get tips on how to grind Bux! Check out the Google+ semiofficial community as well.  Probably the greatest Tuber game on the web, Outerminds. I'll send you a Sponsor Eagle filled with \"Good Job\" messages. Keep your game as good as possible, there's no time to lose in beating PewDiePie to his #1 spot!",

Is Unity attempting the failed micro-transaction business model that's hurt EA in recent years? If so, I know it's a matter of time before someone else develops a similar game, without as many ads. I'd also like to be able to customize my player but failed to see an option for that.",

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",
        "One of the dumbest cod ripoff i have seen and played in 2k18 so far. You need 20 bullets to kill someone with head shot. Dont waste your time with this dumb game. Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

I wish I could buy any hero for gold For that I cannot defeat any hero in galaxy mode. And if my hero is defeated then I can revive my hero for crystal or gold. Otherwise its ok.",
        "This is a great game but the movement isn't smooth and when I got my second character when I enter Galaxy mode it tells me tap in the second hero slot and when I tap nothing happens. Now I can't play my favorite game anymore.",
        "Bug problem after... I finally get a second hero the in game tutorial won't let me fight... And I can't  do anything bu",
        "The game is epic I loved it there is one thing u could improve.if u ,the creators, made it so when the hero died make it so u don't have to revive it. just make it so u have a surtane amount of stamina, a lot, and every battle u do 1 bit of stamina gets taken away and over time it comes back then it would be the best game in the world!!!!!!please do this",
        "Awesome game! Much better than shadow fight 2&3. Only first time downloads will get some problem",
        "Overall it's a cool game. I enjoy it But it'd be much better if we were allowed to switch heroes on our team during conquest in galaxy mode"

        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "No doubt it's a fantasti game! But it stopped working all of a sudden :( it say's no internet connection. I've tried using it through wifi and cellular network data of different network companies. I am affraid all of my data will be lost. Not happy! Will use glu or other companies but Won't use Gameloft again",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "Gameloft devs, there is a problem. I not sure what happened but when I tried recording, the sound glitched out and wasn't working. However, to get the sound back, I have to to Audio/GFX settings and turn the music or SFX volume, up or down. This is very tedious and VERY annoying. Please can you fix this bug/glitch.  Thank you Gameloft.",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."

        "Great game, but it's annoying how you have limited ammo, I mean yeah! It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they're inside of it, you're doing damage to the car, not to mention you can't even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!",
        "I hate this stupid game I have just played this game and you know what happend it crashed everybody do not play this one game and the second one of this it is a stupid game i never even got to play it and i still think it is stupid sorry for the words just fix it plz JJJJJUUUUUSSSSSSTTTTTT fiiiiixxxxxx ittttttt if i could put no stars i willllll",
        "It has a problem, on the map it shows a guy with a hat, but when I go there it is just a building with no one there And I can't get any new missions.i have only completed about 4 missions so they can't be finished. Please fix this.but great game",
        "Great game but more like a sandbox game. The way you are looking will go off in random directions. Few glitches. Wish the sniper rifle had a scope. Wish there was different shooting mechanics. A little lag and too many damn ads there is even an ad for no ads.",
        "I love it! Except, when I blow up a police car while it's parked, it respawns and about 18 police cars are after me! Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn't stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!",
        "I loved it because you can get into people's car and then get out again then kill them because they are trying to kill you so kill them. and there is a tank and a helicopter in this game and I like it so you could kill people walking and get money or there bullets and wepends. that is why I love this game."

Messaged the developers and no one seems to be interested in responding. Rated 1 star but only because I couldn't choose zero.",
        "Leveled up to 16.  Now the game is locked up. Even after a reboot.   Decent game. But failed. Also I purchased 2 packs.  Didn't receive anything.  Shame on me. I tried a second time and took my money again.",
        "I like the game but I can't give it 5 stares untill the glitches are fixed the first is how the wood and seaweed and the crates glitch and u can't grab them with the hook goes right through it and that u will go with nothing for a hour or 2 and u can't build anything. The other thing is u should make it where u only need to eat 2 fish to get full health or at least add a fish catcher so u don't have to stand there and keep catching one fish at a time but other then that I love the game one of the best survival games I have played so far and I have played almost all of them keep the good work up this game will go far",

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Awesome game, it can be very heavy on wanting you to use gems but they're easily earned through playing and hitting watch ad to earn double, small inconvenience and so long as you aren't annoyed by this it's great,   no other ads, brill job."

        "I DONT LIKE THE UPDATE THAT GIVES YOU MORE TIME AFTER FORCE OF CARDS . IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WAYY!!!!! TO MUCH TIME TO COMPLETE THE BOARD. AND IT WAS MORE COMPETETIVE B4. I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging",
        "Time and time again a attacking army with 22 troops defeats a defending army of 22 troops and only losses 4 when the defending army is ment to have the upper hand . Also the game is full of cheaters with two profiles in one game so you cant win. Don't waste your money and time this game is dead there are less and less real players left. They dont care about cheaters just money.",
        "This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.",
        "Very unfair, questionable dice rolls against computers, obviously rigged so that on single player you can never win, and then online it pits you against people who are expert when you're a beginner so you can clearly never win. Very rigged, fun when you get the chance to play which is once every 12 hours due to them asking you to buy the premium version. Highly unfair",
        "This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I've to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this 'replaying' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I've both a very good data and wifi connections.",
        "Very unstable and bad game system. It often disconnected even my internet connection is on the good condition. Sometimes it will lag during online battle and cancel my command, make me lose unfairly. I like the game concept, but the connection system must be improved carefully"

You see, that's how business works. You provide content to the people and exchange there is an expectation of making money. Simple really. People always complain about ads but the thing is, there is no such thing as \"free\".  Most of the ads can be backed out of before the timer runs out.   Enjoy the game for what it is and stop complaining.",

The game runs smooth ,the graphics are abit like 2bit graphics like the old Mario games but after all it is a free game and it passes the time so can't complain. All in all not a bad game, It makes a change from the tap tap tap games.",

Had me hooked at first but it became way way too easy and after setting up auto flip it does it all for you. Needs rethinking pretty much completed in 2 day of playing it. Defiantly not voodoos best game.",

Twice i opened the game to receive my \"while you were away\" money that was over 200 billion both times i tap the collect x2 and it plays the video then quits the game never giving me the money at all just left me as if i never logged off from last i played. Yes its just a game but the object is to earn the cash to buy new items to flip but pointless if the game dont give you the money to progress",
