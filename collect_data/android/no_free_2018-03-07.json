        "Needs way more bats i beat this in 3 days and can't get the ball any farther. Add more bats and I'll give 5 stars.  Update: need to make the bats harder to get i already had all the new ones unlocked when i opened the app after the update. Litterally took one swing with the now highest bat and now there is no point to play.  You should make it like 5,000 km for the next update or something.",
        "Great game! I really love it and its great to play when you want to pass through time. My only issue i have is that my upgrades are so high that i go over the side barrier almost every time. I feel it would be awsome if, like bats, you could unlock new balls. Also, online leaderboards would be awesome, so we can see who holds the current record.",
        "I'll get the negative part done 1st. I'd give this 5 stars if there weren't so many ads!!! For the amount of time you actually get a turn, 30 seconds ads in between every turn is a bit much.  Outside of that this is a very fun addictive game.  Note to new players. Although the ball travels better with a perfect hit, there are too many obstacles if you got straight down the middle. Better to hit just left or right of all that.",
        "Great little time waster. Yes you unlock the bats quickly but still plenty of gameplay left in it. A quick request though, make the central road obstacle free. You need an advantage to hitting the ball \"perfectly\". As it is there are so many obstacles that when I hit it centrally I ALWAYS get 20% less distance",
        "Too easy of a game. Once u upgrade ur strength to 30 plus you have to take into account of the angles. You never want to hit the ball perfect (unless 40+ strength and anything above cactus) because it's  Impossible to hit the ball flush that it aligns with the dotted lane. Oh yeah for those saying ads, turn off the Wi-Fi and play.",
        "I think this game is GREAT and pretty fun but there is some things that I don't like about this game for example THERE IS TO MUCH ADS!!!! not just that but also when you do it perfect it goes straight right??? Well hitting perfect actually sucks because if you go to the middle EVERYTHING is in your way I'd rather hit it on the left or right."

        "It's getting frustrating.. I'm into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can't manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "Took me a little while to get the hang of the controls but it's fun once you do. Could maybe do with some hints to help get the best body position in flight, as this took me a while to figure out. Otherwise, it's a good time sink.",
        "Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.",
        "No idea how the take off works, seems to be a perfect sweet spot but no tutorials to help you find it. Deleted",
        "The game is very good. I like the ice cream helmet! The graphics are good, but when you fall over you look crazy. But other then that I love it. Good work!!! 💖"

It has cute graphics and runs smooth. I just cant get enough. As far as scary no not scary a little like whoa they're gunna hit.. Oh wait phew how did they not hit? RGB keep up the good work with this game and all your other free stuff! You guys make great games for all ages!",
        "Im not normally one for puzzle games but This game is great and addictive, haven't played a game quite like it. This game was done so well from the gameplay to graphics to controls, it is a really fluid experience and a great puzzle game, the new mechanics were introduced perfectly as I progressed and there was never a puzzle too easy or hard the level of difficulty increases and a good rate! Way To Go guys",
        "This is a phenomenal puzzle game. It provides you with an incredibly simple concept that eases the player into the game's mechanics and turns into some very devious puzzles later on. The ads are a bit intrusive, being the ones you could accidentally tap on trying to remove with larger hands (like mine), and unskippable video ads that reward you with in-game currency needed to unlock levels, but those are never necessary, and for less than 2 dollars you can remove them outright. All in all, this is a charming and brain-teasing puzzle game that's well worth your time.",
        "The first levels are okay but after that there's a huge difficulty gap, got really frustrating. Controls are really bad. How I'm supposed to know where I'm taking the truck if my finger is on top of it?",
        "I love this puzzle game to death. I can literally play it all day and never get tired. Thank you for the challenging ones, it gets my brain going and it makes the game more tense. I certainly am inlove with the music. Please put a soundtrack on youtube, I would love to listen to it !! Thank you creators of the game, I enjoy playing it so much, and I do hope that there's more.",
        "I like it! Certain levels were so challenging to beat in Expert Mode I thought it was impossible. But with some patience you can solve it! (With the exception of Houston U-4 how do you beat that in 46 moves lol)"

        "Better game than the other similar. I know the other game was first, but they want you to pay hundreds of dollars upfront so you start at similar pace as this one. Or wait long time, and span of that game is years! Whilst this game is fast to start, cheap, and at free play you can beat it in months, while if you spend a couple of bucks, you can beat it in days, at the most weeks. So basically they sell out this genre for a few bucks, and good riddance! It was fun for a few days, spend few bucks to beat it in few more days, or wait a bit. And thats that. It is, how it is suppose to be.  Edit: increased prices. $99 pack for similar $50 previous gems/$. No 8x multiplier now. No free multiplier in first buy. These games can take months to beat, maybe years, what I have done in few days. Dont play.",
        "Omg ths game is so addictive, if you've never played an idle game then you'll enjoy this one. If you've played idle games then install this one anyway. Its so damn fun and as i said addictive ive failed all my GCSEs because i was just playing this for the entire time during my lessons. The graphics are phenomenal, and game play is absoloutly fantastic as mary poppins would say this app is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Developers please give me some tickets i need them this app is so good damn good i just need more i just need some not alot only a couple of thousand or so, so yeah not alot really please devs please. Again if you have not download it download this app is 5 star guarantee #NoNeedForGCSEs",
        "EDITED REVIEW(new review first): game itself is pretty cool. There's nice bonus gifts that help get the game moving. Artwork is great. That ad with the voice over didnt do this game justice. Game gets 3 stars, ad gets 1. (ORIGINAL REVIEW) Saw an ad for this and must say it was awkward as heck. The voice over didnt seem like a real person or was too nervous to smoothly say the lines. Left an ill impression of the game at first glance. And while it did get my attention as ads are supposed to do, it's not a positive one.",
        "I love who you added as the workers! I not good with comics or super heros but i think thats stanley? And i love how you added chef Gordon Ramsay! If you update this game i have 1 question, can the tech manager of the second floor be steve jobs?",
        "Good game, but they're some bugs that need sorting out. At random times the game just cuts off, sometimes when you are loading up the game it say ooops something went wrong write an email, Evan some of the videos freeze up or just shuts everything down. I would be happy if I could play the game without any problems at all. Thank you for your time and patients. Have a good day.",
        "Game is ok. Don't like that if you purchase items in the game and reset that you lose them. Spent money on crystals, bought multipliers and reset the game and lost them. AdCap let's you keep the items you buy, why doesn't this?"

It's only happened once to me and I'm on level 41. Now that's saying something. It gives you a super good promise and nope it's gone out the window as soon as you get the game",
        "The scene at the end of the level is annoying and takes 5 seconds to play out. Then you have to wait for it to load back to show your stars getting in your chest and your coins. It would be better if it just proceeded to the next level saving about 30 seconds. All that to say, it's an addicting game.",
        "I really enjoyed it up until I got to like level 118. The only way I could figure out the pass that level was to use the things at the bottom of the screen or the things the page where you choose what you want to put in there in advance. But if you don't buy extra coins then you can't either had moves or get anything that will help you along. Not to mention that 100 coins per item is a lot of money. When you charge $2 450 coins. I'm taking this game off my apps.",
        "Although this game is addictive and sometimes fun, it seems the producers of the game are greedily taking advantage of people and getting them to pay money for things not worth it(but they feel the pressure to do so, so they do it). Some things in this game are deliberately set up to make the player fail and become desperate to play on and spend. The Champions League is a poor idea which produces terrible prizes for high ranks, and is just a replay of previous played levels which is a let down.",
        "I completely love this game and I would play it again. But I got one problem that one will help me reinstall my Google Play Store. My phone was reset to the factory state. And now there is something wrong with my Google Play Store. And no one will help me reinstall it I have asked for help on several occasions through Google but no reply",
        "It's fast and fun so much better than the other new ones. I love playing it. Thank u so much for all your work and the time spent making it a blast to play.  PS getting past level 80 isn't  possible so I quit. Made me so sad."

Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I'm newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.",
        "Two words: unlikable ads. Adds pop up befnore you open the game, after at advertises itself, shows another ad, then you get to play, with an add at the bottom. And after your first touch you get another ad that is very difficult not to open. I should have known, it's made by ketchapp. Very unsatisfied. They make so much money and adds and put so many so they annoy you into paying them money for less adds. Greedy.",
        "Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.",
        "Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don't want a load of wasted time, don't download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.",
        "The game sucks it's alwful. It's gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!",
        "I like the game, BUT it is glitchy. Most of the time when I hit \"continue\" to watch an ad for longer gameplay it freezes, so I have to close the app and start over. When I open the app and start playing the first round, an ad pops up and I inevitably click on it because I'm in the middle of playing the round. Please fix these issues, and I'll try to remember to rate this higher once they're fixed."

Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "The game is cool, however its doesnt always move to the lwft oe the right when swipe. A lot of times it will continue to go straight which causes me to die. I know its the game because its when I'm about to pick up something important or jump at a crucial point. Also this ismy 3rd phone and it does it on all phones. This error needs to be fixed.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",
        "Could add more city's it sucks revisiting and not getting new characters.. also the special city boards could have some special effects instead of ... I don't know... looking like a hot dog... what's the point. A hot dog with super speed and stay low would be ideal. Love the game, but to keep playing.. maybe give us something new. The only thing I love is wordy weekends. But only to get the coins back for what I spent on the characters",
        "Sometimes, the game glitches and it's just very annoying when I have the super boots on and I jump on top of the train and then it glitches and the police catch me!  Apart from that very good game but I think the company just needs to improve the graphics...",
        "I can't even play, cause this is a bad day. And this makes it worse, its like seeing a bad nurse. I don't like it, it works for a bit. I don't like trash games, but it is not my fault I am calling it names. Fix it, or people get this bit. This is what I wrote, now write a note. Write a note about my problem, and stop em."

I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",

I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)",
        "It's a nice game alright - lovely graphics and a nice gameplay. But I can't help thinking that it was made for one single purpose - to pull money out of your pocket. The levels are too hard, the moves are never enough so you either have to give up and loose a life or pay for additional moves. Such a shame, I really liked it but I will have to delete it.",
        "This game left me speechless at how incredibly fascinating it was. Some may say that it's just another candy crush saga, but this game is in a whole other league & is more than just matching colors. There is not a single defect in this game. Although, honestly speaking, at 1st it didn't look all that great in the ads I would see of it, but I thought since I continued to see it quite often that I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did because this is one of the GREATEST Mobile games EVER MADE! For me it would easily be top 3 Hands down. I would strongly recommend this to any & everyone. I only wish I were able to grant this Marvelous game 6 Stars.",

Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That's slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.",
        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can't wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!"

        "I remember  the first time I played rolblox it was fun  until it went to far. All I want to do is have fun but it gets to hard it makes the game boring. It's cool an all but I think rolblox creaters should make it a little bit easier. I know I'm one person and can't really make a difference but I want to have fun and I know everybody wants to have fun 2. So rolblox creaters if your seeing this you should think about what I'm saying. Also people out I hope you don't think I'm beeing dramatic but I just want to have fun. It's not about money it's about having fun they even charge you to much money so I just want to have fun. DONT GET ME TWISTED I like the game but it gets to hard. I'm gonna end this with I just want to have fun.😏😏😏",
        "It's really cool and addictive BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! My user is coolstaremojigirl and Mimi_Dev l Uh yeah uh But please give Everyone who starts 100 robux My favorite games r on toolbox is uh flee the facility Dance ur blox off I created that and Jailbreak And survivor have fun Playing roBLOX AND PLEASE I REquest That PUT ROBUX 100 IN THE PPL ACC WHO JOIN PLS",
        "Great game!! The thing I find ANNOYING is that nearly everything costs robux.. Yes, I do have robux right NOW, but for six months I didn't. I think every new account should get 100 robux.. For a cheap shirt, pants, hair and face! (And maybe bloxburg, too)",
        "LOVE IT!! But the controls for mobiles are... you know \"horrible\" and the screen are so glitchy and when I jumped or walked its a little late... and all of the famous games, I cant even play it... when I play it, it will load, it will let me play just for a second and then the screen will go freeze, and then BOOM! It will return to roblox home... hopefully the controls for mobiles can be fix and some other stuff that needs to be fix ≈) TY for this wonderful game and I love it!!♥♥♥ (BTW my profile is \"cutekittyloverMia25\") &gt;.&lt;",
        "During my free time, I like to spend time with my sister, she really enjoys this game so I enjoy it too. There are lots of games to choose from so you can never get bored. But I have one suggestion for the mobile version, please add parties, it is super hard to get on the popular games with her that she wants to play.",
        "I loved the game but seriously, you need to make the loading faster! I chose to play (for example: Fashion Famous) then I loaded it after 1 hour it doesn't still have loaded. I know tons of people want to play that but why so slow?? :&lt;"

        "Good game to pass your time. Upgrade costs and parts spawn rates are reasonable if you only use a few vehicles because it will take a long to yo max out everything. I think it will be better if league vs trophies distribution are reworked because its very easy yo reach legends. should give a higher win bonus at higher trophies i think to make it more competitive. And lastly, hackers should be deleted from leaderbord.. there are a few impossible timings on the board.",
        "I enjoy the game greatly. It's slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I'm not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game",
        "I love this game. Every game I've had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I've unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn't almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.",
        "Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn't mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝",
        "Well done with stealing the boxes idea from clash royale wow you didn't even Change the opening times, I think the next thing you should do is offering legendary and epic chests with legendary and epic cars. I have loved the first part of this game it was funny and doesn't make any pressure on you, the second one should be blocked from play store, shame on you..",
        "If you don't want to give away free stuff from the chests, don't. But stop wasting my damn giving me these \"free\" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change."

Could you please add the opinion to change the cash to English pounds (£) and the chance to open more lockers and better chances on getting rare items. And tell us which cities we could find certain items we need to have in storage to complete missions.",

Now, when i boot up the game, it just freezes when i click on anything. My shop tries to open but just goes to a black screen and freezes. I will try to play for a few more days, but if i cant play by the end of the weekend, i will be deleting the game.",

And the rest of the screen shows the normal background for mutt's semi legal store, and I pretty much can't do anything when this happens. I have to reset the game, and each time I try to \"show results\" in mutt's semi legal store, same thing happens. Please fix this",

When I try to tap on the one of the first buildings you unlock, it tells me it's still downloading but is stuck at 0%. I've tried restarting the app, restarting my phone, reinstalling the app, but the problem persists. If this was resolved I'd definitely give it a better rating.  Edit: Contacted support and received assistance. In some cases you have to manually enable permissions prior to opening the game to fix the problem. An annoying bug, but an easy fix.",

You may have to walk away empty handed, forcing long wait times or for you to pay. Being able to play a game is the most important thing in a game and this one locks you out too often.",

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I'm not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr",
        "Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I'm paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn't make it worth the price being asked.",
        "I'd say it's worth it even as a free game.  It's a fun game to kill time. Even if you run out of tickets there's many ways you can earn more on the free side. To purchase at 10 bucks the play becomes almost non stop. Good buy, good time killer, challenging, and overall enjoyable game, free or paid for.  5 stars from me.",
        "I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren't here. They don't connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw",
        "This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.",
        "Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I'd be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally"

        "THE basic idea is admirable, but the demographic of the game make it impossible to get vehicles unless you pay for them. If not for that this would be a five star game. It's annoying to sit and grind and NEVER get the parts you need to upgrade your vehicles to higher tier. Don't play this, unless you have some money to put into it.",

        "Was enjoying the game.  Something happened an update or something and now the game has terrible performance, lags and stutters bad, even single player and the challenges.  I have a note 8 so its not on my end.  Tried uninstalling and installing, no change.  Too bad, it was fun.",
        "This game is fun, but I would be setttled with happy if I got to have 10 keys to use in multiplayer instead of just 5. Secondly this app eats too much battery that my OS gives a notification for that every time. Please consider this.",

        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.",
        "The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game"

Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, \"Thank-you\"  for a truly  wonderful game.",

Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are 'rolling points' that I haven't figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different 'skins' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I'm having fun. Maybe you can too.",

I could NEVER take my eyes off this game as its AMAZINGLY fun. I was not expecting it to be THAT fun, but it was!!! There is absouloutly NOTHING WRONG about this game. The only  thing that is wrong is when people say bad things about this game. But there are NO glitches, barely no adds n NO expectations! This game is absouloutly my MOST favourite  game OF ALL the others.👍",

        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience.",
        "Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad.",
        "Not bad for free. Minimal ads. The two drawbacks are that in career mode, the game is slanted in the opponents favour too much. And in 1 on 1, it takes forever to load an opponent. Fix that and I would give it a five star rating. Also, it would be nice to see the developer actually respond to some people's concerns."

The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn't show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.",
        "This used to be an awesome game. I played it every day! But after the latest update, the ads at the top cause the game to lag terribly and make the ball fall very slowly and the pieces disappear slowly.  I can't adjust as needed due to the lag. I'm unable to play due to this lag. Interestingly enough, when I turn on Airplane Mode thereby disabling the ads across the top, everything runs smoothly like it used to!! I am all for ads to support the developers  but this type they currently have causes severe lag which has rendered the game useless.",
        "I have paid £2.99 to remove ads and in still getting them. I emailed the developer two weeks ago and have still not had a response. You are forced to watch ads so often the game becomes unplayable and paying the money to remove them does not work. Save your time and do not bother even installing it. If you do install it do not pay the money to remove ads as it does not work!!!",
        "Good concept. Too bad the ads ruin the calibration. Either the ad loads and is in the way or it doesn't load and shifts the page. This second issue is the worst of the two. This completely ruins the calibration and forces you to touch above or below the tile you want to remove. Often times leading you to remove tiles you don't want to",
        "Sadly, it could've been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.",
        "There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen"

    "description" : "Six! is the latest game from Gram Games, makers of global smash hits 1010! and Merged!. This game is challenging, exciting and infuriating at times. As with all great puzzlers, Six! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points.  You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.It sounds easy, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you’ll find it’s not as easy as you originally thought.

    "descriptionHTML" : "Six! is the latest game from Gram Games, makers of global smash hits 1010! and Merged!. This game is challenging, exciting and infuriating at times. As with all great puzzlers, Six! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.<br><br>In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points.  You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.<br><br>It sounds easy, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you&#x2019;ll find it&#x2019;s not as easy as you originally thought. If the removal of the blocks topples the tower  or the hexagon gains momentum and rolls off the screen, then it&#x2019;s game over and you have to start all over again. <br> <br>Challenging, emotive and blissfully simple to play.

Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again.

It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",

        "Terrible game. I can't pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something.",
        "Far too many ads. One here and there is understandable but after every single try, you get an add. Definitely uninstalled for that reason. As far as the game itself, it's really fun and could be addicting but I spent more time trying to get through the ads than I did playing the game."

        "Since the last time I installed this game, you have, no doubt made upgrades and updated the app, but I installed again and it has already crashed on me 3 times in one sitting and during gameplay, it buffered or glitched to where the rhythm was completely off which caused me to lose a life. Can you do something to fix this problem. I love the quality of music and the gameplay but there are issues that need to be fixed. Thank you in advance.",
        "The first time I played this game..... I thought that it was some weird game...but the time I started playing I felt like I'm a epic cool game....and I deleted this game because no storage in my phone... So sorry about that and make your game better",

        "This is the best game ever!! It has beautiful and I mean BEAUTIFUL songs! It's also a great gameplay idea! And my highest score is Wedding Piano, with 3074 :3",

Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I've paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.",
        "This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren't) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.",
        "I very much prefer this to other color-by-numbers. The pixel art is a lot more straightforward than the random, unnecessarily confusing blobs of traditional cbns. Love the art style! And everything else.  My only problem is having to scroll through everything to get to the ones I haven't done yet. Any chance you could add a \"hide completed\" function or something? Please?!?",
        "In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it's just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.",
        "I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It's kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺",
        "I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn't know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I'm always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty ."

It does this in the middle of a round, so obviously it screws up my gameplay. Makes me consider paying for no ads, but also makes me want to delete.",
        "Very fun and addictive. But there are these ads that open up my internet browser when I'm playing. Also, beeping noise came from the app. I immediately pressed the home button and the beeping stopped, so I know it's the app making those noises. Please fix the ad issue in the next update. :)",
        "Cool looking game played like 15 matches. Annndd then it started freezing. In a single player match i would fire 2 shots and the my entire phone would stop and the only way to get out is to close the app. Im using a galaxy j7",
        "Game was fun the first day I downloaded it.  The next day it would freeze during the first battles and I would have to kill the app each time.  This happened multiple times already and with different characters.  I have an LG G5.  Deleting the app since it's not even playable for me.  Such a shame...love these angle games and this one has cool/funnt gameplay.",
        "An unbelievable amount of ads in an otherwise fun game.   Ads after every match and spam ads trying to open my web browser multiple times mid match, somtimes when I'm preparing my shot which completely ruins it. Such a shame the devs chose to ruin their own game because of greed. Sadly this is more common than not nowadays.",
        "Got some lag when playing pvp with random player. Oponent hp didn't decreased, even if i hit 'em. And also... Too many IN GAME ADS. (sometimes it's very annoying)."

        "I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I'm not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain't getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜"

        "I really like the game itself but just now I after hitting the \"Get Coins\" button a webpage opened up and redirected a bunch of times then I got one of the fake google error pop ups about a \"dangerous virus\" that i needed to \"click the link below NOW\". So users please be careful, it looks like the apps advertising partners might be a little dangerous.",

The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "Great app! Loads quickly, gameplay is smooth and intuitive. I also haven't found the different levels of difficulty to be repetitive, which is a good thing. I have found with other Sudoku apps, a pattern emerges from each of difficulty so that I almost know what the puzzle will look like by picking how hard it will be.  This one isn't like that thankfully!",
        "Easy to use.   Love the pencil so you can mark choices.   Also like that it tells you if you make a stupid mistake like putting the same number in a column.   Haven't tried the hint feature yet,  but hoping it will help me learn when I don't see any options.",
        "Definitely the best sudoku game ever. Tried downloading many others but kind of lame. This have 3 colours to choose. Pencil to write note and the level is very legit. I totally recommended this for those who want to play sudoku only okay😏",
        "Allows pencils marks and automatically removes them once a permanent number is set.  Has options to show when a wrong number is placed or not. Easy flow. Good game play. It has easy, medium, hard and expert levels. This is a good app.",
        "Good game. Having a hard time not using some of the hint options, but it's helpful that I can turn them off by choice! Really enjoying computerized version 😉"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.",
        "It is an amazing game. Our entire family is hooked and i love the idea of neighbourhood chat on hay day it is awesome!!! Continue making this game as cool as it is👍. However it would be nice to have private chat on hayday where the entire neighbourhood does not see your conversation. There is also a glitch where i cannot open my daily videos."

        "Easy to play.  Very addictive.  Game moves as fast, or as slow, as you do; the pace adapts well for both casual and serious players.  You can play on both your desktop and mobile interchangeably with the same account!  Developers are very much a part of the community; constantly improving the game and running in-game events.  While there are in-app purchases I never feel pressured... I spent a few $ because I wanted to support the game as I've been enjoying it throughly.",
        "This is a great game. I have played it for over 2 years now and it's still my favorite game. Advice to newbies, take your time. Stay in one age and build up your resources before moving on. You can play in multiple worlds, join guilds, make friends and they have great quests to do if you choose to.",
        "It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn't cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.",
        "Game is amazing me and my partner have been playing it for years and it has connected us in such a real way. Thank you for the amazing forge experience. I just deleted my reindeer from christmas event by accident and if i could somehow get it back plz help with any way possible thank you",
        "Very annoying problem with Google Play account disconnections at task swap. Fix this, and I will be able to actually play the game. Since I use my phone for making real income, I need to swap screens to other activities, and each time do a four step log in process back into the game. I have never seen this problem before in any other game, no reason this game would be different. Unfortunatly the problem seem to become worse, I would not spend money on this game, too shaky account control. Will uninstall it now and go shopping for something more reliable. A shame as the game itself is really neat.",
        "This is a wonderful game, great effect and a wonderful story line. My only issue is logging in. I keep getting a message saying my internet connection is not working, yet with no internet connection I would not even get to the sign in page. Please fix this issue or I am done."

Sometimes I will go a whole day with no shields and the whole time I'm getting attacked. The other thing is the bonus spin. Never have I won more that 250k coins. I know you want us to pay for another spin but maybe award a higher number once in a while. All in all cute game.",
        "Game is pretty cool but I won't spend money because what you get for your money is not worth it. They raise the prices of the chest to get cards and it's already hard to get the coins to build villages, get raided and attacked so much it takes months to get to the next villages. I hope y'all up the amount of coins on spins because it doesn't go up much at all but the cost of everything else shoots up like crazy.",

If you play this game,DO NOT SPEND MONEY TO BUY SPINS. People can steal your earnings... so you basically pay actual money, to give others coins...",

        "It's really addictive,like I'm a Sugar Crush- aholic :-)  But..... I had collected 60  gold bars and I couldn't get them unless I paid 2.99. So I wasn't to impressed by that. But nevertheless it's a great game so keep up the good work. Two thumb's up for me",
        "3142 has a glitch in which when you use a speckled chocolate booster to start and match a trio (3) next to it, it sets the choc booster off, despite no colour bomb or stripe candy being formed next to it. Have screen shots if it would help to fix. Won't waste any more boosters. Please correct, thanks.",
        "It keeps telling me my \"gold bars are full\" when I do well, but wants real cash when I try to use them. I refuse to spend real cash on an online....but addictive as hell that I am tempted to! Advise...If you have the sliqhtest of addictive personality. Stay away....",
        "Not so keen on the  graphics, the actual sweets are OK,  but, the puppets etc are not so good. It can take ages, days in fact to win the super hard games if you don't,  like me, buy help, and the free help you have earned are used up in the first go. So it takes perseverance.  Good game.",
        "Gripes: 1. The option to skip Sugar Crush takes a LOT longer to come out than before. Should come out almost as soon as Sugar Crush starts. Big waste of time and battery life. 2. Decreasing # of moves/time in levels that are already difficult to start with making it virtually impossible to finish them without boosters. 3. There should be shortcuts to earlier levels for those of us who want to revisit them to get more stars/better scores. Becoming increasingly necessary as the total # of levels is approaching 3000.",
        "If you like bejeweled Type puzzle games you will love this one. It's far more challenging with every level. Sometimes I wanna throw my iPad or phone at the wall...but I can't get enough of this game!"

Please put this in your next update I will do an even better review. Let me what you think about these ideas.",

        "Liked the look of it, got past the first intro bit where u fix the first car and it shows u how to get the next car but then when I go to tap and hold on a engine part to get rid of it it doesn't let me it just stays normal or rotates the camera, so couldn't play any further, so can't give a fair review unfortunately as I couldn't experience it properly",
        "I absolutely love the game it's so realistic I love it I play this everyday pretty much but the only thing is I bought the $4.99 gold pack and my game crashed and I did not receive my 500 gold may I please have my gold cause it took my money to",
        "The is awesome but add cars that have turbo and u can buy turbo too intercooler charge pipes and other piping and Better thing to do also add customers to bring their cars to be fix instead of just buying barns alone",

        "The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn't receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.",
        "I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn't allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn't do and I was charged another $4 when I didn't even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn't even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I'm taking this here where others can see. Don't spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There's no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.",
        "Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you're out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.",
        "I got a new phone and I installed this game on it and it put me on level 5. I was on level 32. I had 56 stars and my combat power was on 72000. If it don't update the game with my current data I don't think I am going to play it anymore. I don't want to star all over again.",
        "This game is great. Only issue I have is when you play online and it loads incorrectly or the other player times out , you can't exit without losing coins even though the other player never loaded. It's frustrating losing coins for no reason.",
        "Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care"

        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A☆' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday's.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that's all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I'll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don't like so many clocks in one game and the \"timed\" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.",
        "Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it's a great game lol I enjoy playing it.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉",
        "If you like 🍬 Crush on Facebook? Then you will like this game even better. The graphics are cute and the 🐟 give you occasional hints as to what will make them super happy. And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. 💘 the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants 🐟 and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with 🎶 turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "NejiOmeGa here!🙏 I have got to say this game is a \"quick paste first place!\" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!🙇 I've loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I'm a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who's Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherz😂😂",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don't disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...",
        "This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don't use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊"

        "Very run game.  Just wish you could save your progress when you have to exit out for a phone call, text messages, reboot the device or anything that requires you to exit.  That's the only reason I gave 4 🌟's. Once they add save life option I will change to 5 🌟's. Great game though. Would recommend everyone to try this game.",
        "This is possibly the greatest game on the Store right now. There so much you can do in the game and I'm excited to see what will come. And the best part is that this game doesn't require internet to play and doesn't have a great deal of ads. My friends all have iPhones and say that this game looks sweet and ask if its in the Apple Store. I have to say no, but if you guys ever plan on making an Apple version, that'd be pretty cool on their end.",
        "Great game. Fun to play. I would add more Interaction options with partner and more options for personal fun. I would add things like joining a sports team, Pub with mates, dinner parties, date night. I would also add in renting out houses. Just more things to do for fun. Will give 5 star review if added",
        "This is a decent game, but it needs a lot of work. I think there should be more options after school than just college then work average Joe jobs or go to prison. I suggest the possibility to get into politics, become president even (or prime minister, or not be able to at all depending on country), or join the military, and perhaps participate in wars if they arise. Right now, the game really only offers boring straightforward lives, and I hope that is changed.",
        "This is one of the best games I have ever played! And it's so simple. The unknown thought of what can happen and the varieties of life you can have is extraordinary! You guys deserve hella credit for such a good game! Save feature would be nice though. :)",
        "This game is addicting! A touch confusing at first, but easy enough to get the hang of it and then all you'll want to do is play it. I would like to see grandparents, siblings, neices/nephews added as well as the characters children being playable by adding button for them to get married and have children. For what it is those, it's great!"

I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I'm thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven't even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that's all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.",
        "So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though"

        "Good game. Advert after every mission and some bullets can go through the guy you're trying to shoot at like a hologram. Graphics aren't good at all but you have got recoil and swaying scope that I noticed as well. All in all, pretty good game. Maybe add a toggle to gold your breathe in the future so that it doesn't sway?",
        "Listen developers, you guys should be honest to us, we download to play and for fun. But when we pass few levels we have to wait for upgrades, this game offer us such weapons which are out of our earning. This game should absolutely free, no premium, low cost upgrades, no boring ads . Either everyone will uninstall after 1 - 2 months. Guarantee",
        "This is a great game but the bottom line is the developers want you to spend money upgrading. You get along so far upgrading with coins, which can be earned. Then they want tokens, which you must buy, to go further. The deals on weapons that are offered are always just out of reach. You can earn diamonds watching videos but I would rather play a game than waste time watching stupid add so I can play a game. It was fun but no more. Deleting.",
        "After the update on 2nd Mar-18, Spec ops not loading. Game simply terminate itself while trying to load spec ops Level 16. Everything else is working fine. I'm stuck 😓😪 Update: now I can't play even Daily Mission😩😤",
        "It's a real fun game for shooting.  I am giving 3 stars because gears are very expensive. I have reached level 8 without buying anything because all my earnings are not enough to buy a decent gun. You want people to pay rather then buy through skill earned point. But still great game.",
        "I like this game but you have to spend money to really enjoy it. The only way that you can get other guns is if you buy it with diamonds (lots of them) and by going premium which sucks. Graphics isn't even that good for you to spend money for this game. A waste of time tbh. Deleting it"

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it's pretty much an insta-win. I don't know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn't, you should probably put some spikes there or something.",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero."

        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",
        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.",
        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn't need to have the internet on. Don't know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.",
        "It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious....."

        "Transferring to SD is broken, yet again! Almost every other update re-enables transferring the app data to SD. Is it possible to have this feature permanent? Various updates regularly break it. The option is there, but it keeps giving a generic error message. It isn't my SD card, I have a genuine 64GB Samsung Evo Plus. It is definitely the app itself causing the issue, as I could transfer the previous versions fine. And especially as every single other app with the option to move to SD works fine. This is the only app on my phone with this feature that it intermittently doesn't work.",
        "Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts",
        "Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that's just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)",
        "Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn't that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.",
        "I love this game! Been just playing on my wife's account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won't even register me moving. I've tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what's going on?",
        "thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location"

        "I love the game it is so simple yet super fun. Just the only down side is that there are WAY to many ads. I stared playing a round and then an ad pops up.. Like really. At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:",
        "Don't get me wrong this app is addicting and fun. The thing that ruins this app is ads. For a game were it is meant to be played in quick bursts and you aren't meant to succeed for long periods of time, i don't understand how you can put an ad after every attempt. Sure one per 3 to 5 games and the another 30 second ad, but at the rate they come this game isn't fun anymore. The craziest thing to me is that i can't find a way to invest a few cents into the app to perma-block the ads. Come on dev i know you can do better than this. I will adjust the rating when i am offered a solution. Until then this 4 to 5 star app has 1 to 2 star potential.",
        "It would be 5 stars if for one, the ball didn't just disappear more or less everytime it goes of the screen. And two, if the ball actually moved when i tap the screen rather than decide to just lay on the ground like a dead badger. As for reason three, there are waaaay to many ads. It asks me if i want to watch an ad to continue so then i press no and it still makes me watch an ad, that's just cheap. I understand they have to make money but this is a whole different story here. But  when it does decide to work and when i turn my wifi off, its pretty fun.",
        "Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn't be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!"

        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks",
        "I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "I like this game, it's so cool, but, whenever you have to leave the match, it punishes you for leaving the game! You loose trophy's. So you can't leave the game if you don't want to lose trophys. Sometimes we often have to leave the game because other important stuff get in the way or our moms are saying that we need to get off. Having a punishment for leaving the game is the most unfair and cruel rule in this game. There shouldn't be a rule of punishment because they think if you leave the game, you are a sore loser. This needs to change, because we are not all sore losers when we leave the game Pixel Gun 3D!",
        "This game has some faults (microtransactions and pay to win) but overall is amazing. Doesn't need a powerful phone to play, can occupy you for hours, and can help you meet new people. I got this game a month ago and haven't stopped playing since. This is one of my favorite games of all time, over all devices and consoles. I highly encourage you to download this game if you enjoy minecraft-styled graphics and multiplayer fps. And surprisingly there is a truck load of customization: Clan Forts, Home Base, Skin Editor, Armor, Weapons, and Pets. Sandbox has lots of toxicity but is tolerable. Overall 10/10 and a must-get for try hards and casual gamers alike.",
        "This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That's why I rated this game 5 stars."

I've been killed 6 times now by someone or some people using only a vehicle and running other people over. Nerf the vehicles and I'll rate 5 star.",
        "This game is cool adictive best controls and cool cars, jeeps and also gliders.. but one thing to say: Update needed Every sunday they can get epic paints for guns and clothes,pants or in daily missions thats all. Oh wait how to use spray button to paint vechile job?",
        "The game really ok. I love the feature where you can talk to your team online. However, since I've updated my ROS, it became super loggy and now I can't even open it to play. I tried to re-install the game but still, it won't open anymore. What happen? Please fix it immediately.",
        "I love the game over all. There is one thing that ticks me off the cars. people get them then chase u and knock u down. Once u r knocked down they get out of the car and kill u. IT'S RIDICULOUS. The fact that you cant shoot through the fences makes it so others can use them as coves while u move to them and get killed",
        "No complaints about the game, i liked it. It's just that i lost my account today and i dont know what's the cause. last time i played it i closed the game when i finished a match by pressing the home button and left it there for a few hours. when i open the game again my account was lost. i forgot to bind my account to any social media because i thought i already binded it by sharing to facebook. is there any way you guys can help me ?",
        "This is F ridiculous!! I experienced more glitches after the update!! The updates didnt do anything much about the glitches!! People will just appear from nowhere!! I played this game everyday and every single day i always experience glitches!! The sound is also confusing even if you try to listen.You hear sounds that coming from the back but the enemy is actually in front."

        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "DownIoad \" VEARN \" App Ref (DAKA) to Start Earnings So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. 3K points equals $6 instead of like some of the others where it takes 6K points to reach $1 etc....Also, DownIoad \" TOYOCASH \" App Ref (DAKA) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Paypal. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "It's always been my favourite game I must say. The graphic aspects as well as the new features are very good. The only problem is that my troops and my village people are almost transparent since the first th11 update. Now I don't mind very much but it would be nice if you could solve this issue.",
        "Love the game. I have a problem with the new update though, not sure if I'm the only one. When I go to attack in builders Base the game goes off and when I go back on the game it says my attack is 0% and the other person is attacking me. Please fix that. The same thing happens when I try to open my star laboratory, the game switches off. Please see what the problem may be. Thank you.",
        "It is the best game ..it's addictive and amazing ..Well done supercell..I m playing from 1 yr. and I m the 9 now..but plz decrease the amount needed for walls upgrade..&plz don't make it like 'Township'....Liked it much...😃😍 Plz do something to disable players from sending abusive words.. and remove trader bcz its a worst character that asks so much gems .."

There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Addictive, colourful and charming. I love it because I've spent zero real money on it and am at over level 280! I only use my in game coins when I'm desperate and I'm fine only playing a few times a day to let lives regenerate. Some levels are so frustrating but that's why you save the coins!",
        "I believe the game would be more relaxing if the timed levels were either gone or longer.  Also, 2 stars to complete almost anything is ridiculous.  Takes me a week to play a day.  And the rewards for levels should be higher.  Otherwise, the graphics are nice. The rewards are getting better, would still like 1 star to complete a task.",
        "Enjoyable but just not enough lives. Phone conversations could be on 1 screen. I know that you can skip them but you might miss something important. Fed up with doing things like using lives to make calls and feeding and training the dog.  I originally gave it a higher rating, but now I've played for some time I realise it's not as great as I thought.  Too many lives used to gain just 1 star now. Need to be able to decorate more.",
        "Should make the money in higher value as it is very hard to accumulate.  Poor marks because it takes so much of your hard earned levels and drops you down the ranks if you don't solve immediately.  I was at ruby level and have so many points taken away now I am back to silver....uninstalling thanks for nothing."

It happened only once; looked like the opponent was hacking the game. He was potting all of the balls like that, and there was also full network. If you can fix it, then the game can be improved.",
        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱",
        "\"Cusion shot on 8 ball\" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better."

        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there's an ad, some you can't skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don't even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "Good little time waster, simple classic gameplay but puts its own unique twist on it.   Side note: I clearly played this game more than they thought anyone would as I have started getting repeated designs when I upgrade my spells xD",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don't take it away from me. It is beautiful."

        "I used to play this game a couple years ago, and at the time, it had satisfying gameplay and great time killing qualities. I used to love it then and I still do now, but I've recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that's driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn't allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I'm not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.",
        "Marvelous game!!! Likely you back to the right on your last update.  I just purchased the chainsaw blade, the DRAGON blade was a huge desappointment we was expecting phenomenal motions not that catoon flag . Also : all the good stuff are in mini game, the others dojos are kind very less quality, let us use minigame blades and dojos in arcade or zen even by purchase that will be nice. Thank you",
        "I downloaded the game, and loved it. But now whenever I try to open it, it goes up to the loading screen, and then takes me back to my home screen.",

Some tasks take a lot of patience to complete though! It would be really good if you could see the task progress from the game screen as it's hard to keep track of 6 available tasks.",

        "Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.",
        "What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don't even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can't place anymore and you lose.",
        "This is very deceiving. It looks like it's Tetris, but it's not. The pieces don't come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it's not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.",
        "Would like to sometimes when my score is really high get a second chance to redeem myself. Other wise I like the game - kills some time when needed👍",
        "Love the game can't seem to put it down. Great time passes while you're waiting for your washing to dry at the laundromat, beats watching it spin around. Not happy with all the adds popping up after every game and sometimes in the middle of a game."

        "Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.",
        "This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don't worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you'll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!",
        "I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who's better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn't seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don't think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.",
        "This game has no WORLD'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let's download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.",
        "Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems."

        "I've been on Township since 2015 and I absolutely love it. Its the first game I play in the morning and the last one I play at night. This game has so much personality. From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I've played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don't have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.",
        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game.",
        "Fantastically animated time-killer, very detailed and interesting to watch when you actually do pay attention to the stuff that happens around a well designed town. The co-op portion of the gameplay is just enough social interaction that I like in games like this. It isn't forced. Nothing really is, and that is rare for games like this. Keep them coming, I'm enjoying them!"

        "DON'T INSTALL THIS GAME...it's just another money machine. I'd played this game for 4 month and the amount of money you have to spent to be able to level up your teams is endless. You will pay for an lootbox system and be sure...it's just a money machine with ridiculous prices...this is far away from free to play... The leveling management and so called game meta is simply stupid...\"Do you wanna lose a raid-match when your team is on 3000 and the other on 2200 points.\" ...ridiculous. Updates are just \"price enhancements\" and new modes which are only playable if you spent more money.",
        "I've played this game for quite some time now.  I've spent a good deal of money and have enjoyed it up until now.  The basic gameplay is fun but if you want to be competitive it is a must to spend money.  The most frustrating part though is spending money and getting nothing in return.  I've been waiting for mats for a couple five stars for months.  The problem is you're not rewarded for what you put in it is all about luck of the draw.  An unlucky person like myself could spend a lot and wait forever to see any benefit",
        "I a, enjoying the game I do agree with some that if you want to really enjoy it you have to spend but idk why people moan about that as at the end of the day that's life you end up having to pay for anything and everything you don't have too no one is forcing you too!! You choose too so stop whining however with that being said I do thing the cost of gems packs are exspensive consider lowering the price maybe more will be willing to pay to play..",
        "Out of everything a few hours in. Complex and stingy. Slow, tedious  progression. Very random luck on  gameboard with too few gems shown to have any matching strategy.  Relies on random matching of gems falling. Uninstalling.",
        "I just did 4x 10pulls and didnt get a single 5*. Seriously, that's just poor management. Last time I spend any money. Don't spend your cash, it wont be beneficial. I wish I coukd get a refund.",
        "Despite the balancing improvements the game particularly in Raids still needs lots of improvements since someone with 400 less power than you with characters in lower tiers can still completely kick your ass. Serious detriment to wanting to continue to play if no matter how you level them up you still lose."

Now, with this new update, i cant even play anymore; it just freezes up during the loading page...",
        "Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.",
        "A giant mess of people who pay a ton of money to prey on anyone with impunity. Absolutely no rules regarding who or how often you can attack someone significantly lower in level. Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.",
        "I love the game, it's great and always looking forward to playing it, and lately it's been freezing and exiting me out of the game every couple of minutes. So it's kind of hard to enjoy this great game. Also I don't know if there's a way to develope another estate but I think that would be beneficial to the game and pretty cool.",
        "You guys really need to do some balancing. It's ridiculous that a level 22 guy can just annihilate me when I'm level 10. Its pretty blatant that you're trying to force us to pay to play. You should make it to where you can only attack X levels below you and the further down you go, the less loot/xp you get, if you attack even or higher you get bonus loot/xp. Good game but needs rebalancing asap or your game will slowly die."

Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",

I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.",
        "I really like this game. But here is why I gave it 2 stars.  I completed all of the challenges but still don't have have enough score to finish ranking up.  The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don't think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes..."

Maybe you should let us watch ads for 2-5 diamond's each ad. Or do a daily login type thing. I know you guys wont but I've been playing this game a ton and for a long time. i restart everything because when you guys make new stories it makes me want to use diamonds but I don't have anymore. I restarted the game like over 10 times honestly. Thanks for a great game though.",
        "They did what i asked! I told them that i like rp games and im a boy and theres no boy roles and now there giving me the choice to be a girl or boy and its so much fun now! Thats why i give it five stars and for u new people it is kind of like a tell tale game but has really good graphics so if u r reading this and if u like rp games just download it!",
        "I never thought I would find a game like this that would work so well and play so easily! The only things I would change would be adding videos to gain more gems, or getting 2 gems after each chapter. Maybe even some extra gems after finishing a story? Getting gems on previously finished stories as well. I would also add the option to replay a chapter from the menu, not only after playing the chapter. Other than that, THIS GAME IS A MUST PLAY!",
        "I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I've purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I'm really hooked on. Not to mention I've put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I'm limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It's just too expensive in the end.",
        "I have fallen in love with this app and whoever created the stories is creative and amazing, however it would be nice if you could make it so we can earn more keys per time given and definitely make it so the good choices don't cost so many diamonds. Those two factors get really annoying and depressing. All the good choices cost way too many diamonds. Unless  you make it so we can earn more of those per chapter and let us earn free ones by watching adds or something. Otherwise, amazing game. Thanks.",
        "Love this app... but please give us more keys and gems. 2 keys is just not enough when you are addicted. Only problem i have is the cost of some of the clothes and choices. Please make it cheaper and easier to get gems without having to spend real money. How about let us watch adds for keys and gems ? PLEASE!! We need more gems!"

        "At first, the game was good. But after time passed, there is a little gameplay between advertisements.  The game has been sold to advertisements where ads even come in between while you are playing. Very annoying.  Disappointed.   Uninstalling.",
        "Hi everyone!  I'm really not a fan of this game, I mean it's ok I'm not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn't my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark \"Xxx\" and I'll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍",
        "Was super fun until you introduced balls achieved by watching ads and a luck based ball/challenge system. The devs got greedy and ruined this great time waster",
        "Game is good, but why on Earth does it consume up to 150 MB of phone storage?  Surely the collectable balls can't be requiring that much data storage.  After clearing cache and data the app alone takes 90MB.",
        "I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I'm disappointed, expecially for the \"restore purchase\" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.",
        "Great game 🤘🏼 totally addicted from the moment I started to play! Very few ads unless I request them...Lots of challenges... Excellent free game.... We worth a download 🤘🏼"

        "This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest's and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven't tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.",
        "Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a \"slide,\" I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don't compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.",
        "Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.",
        "I love all the graphics it's a bit like the        piano tiles it test's your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.",
        "It's my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn't quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a 'save me,' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it's a brilliant game.",
        "This is a good mindless game but the interactions have been inconsistent which leads to frustration. They also insist on scrolling through ALL achievements which pops up in the most inconvenient place and this happens multiple times per access, not just at the start. Possibly the most annoying thing ever. Also I would rather be able to pay to have ads removed besides special perks, the lack of this means this games life is limited to me."

I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn't go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I'd like to. Please improve it.",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Plez put some changes in upgrading options..... Like..when we upgrade our vehicles...... Vehicles should look different...and..some added things like....nitros.,new wheels and etc.... By this changes this game will be liked and can be played by more and more people"

        "Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don't play this game  you'll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase",
        "Not a good game for new players.  Was fun and  interesting at first but you qucikly realise that you are just food for high level players with no way to reach a defensible level.  High level players basically teleport in, raid everyone and teleport out.  They should lock servers to keep it balanced and give more guidance for new players. This game is  clearly weighted towards the people who have been playing it the longest. Dont waste your time",
        "Kingdom 249 is open before just 50 days back. And one guild have 2B might. Most of the guys have millions of might one of them got 700M might. How's this is possible. Kingdom 277 is opened before 15 days back but one guild K03 got more powerful. Top guys got 120M might in just 15 days. Does IGG employees playing this game. We are lover of this game please don't lose your credibility. This two kingdom which I observed only Chinese players are strong. How overall kingdom only Chinese players got higher might in less time.",
        "This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.",
        "Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don't mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.",
        "Gameplay is good, not a lot to complain about. As far as purchasing via in-app, BE CAUTIOUS AS THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OR THE QUANTITY OF THE SUPPLIES YOU PURCHASE FROM WHAT WAS ADVERTISED TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT SEE REIMBURSEMENT."

        "This game is amazing! A real time waster and It's really fun! But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤",
        "Everything players have asked for is added. At a ridiculous price.  But if people are paying that's on them.   HOWEVER you shouldn't have to buy the adult /baby formula more than once. If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.",
        "This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren't for the ADS. I get it's a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It's one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.",
        "I am so happy for the people who made this app!!!! You guys must make good money off of millions of things that are on this game. I respect you guys more than anything one who has this game. Have a good rest of the year. Love Braylynn Burke",
        "I do like the game. It gives me something to do with my mine. I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME I TRY TO PLAY IT, IT POPS UP WITH ADDS SAYING I HAVE A VIRUS!",
        "Its so cool and great \"WOW!!!!!\" to the very best game of all  Its bad because its to expensive crystals are so rare in the game and you want from us all the crystals i saved so i am talking about two players this phone and player Kaile ALL THE BEST OF LUCK TRYING TO FIX THE GAME PROBLEM! 👍✌🤘"

        "Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It's not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please",
        "It is nice that they let the readers write their own stories.  Many of the stories written by readers are more interesting than what Episode offers... The game takes too long to load when I open it and also when it loads a story.  Then you have to sit through at least two ads just to play the story. They need to let authors be able to delete their stories.  That would probably help on the loading time. Maybe if an author wants to delete their story, they have to explain why.  Then the story could be pending deletion (and have a note for readers) until Episode decides to accept or decline.",
        "I LOVE THIS! But, just a thing, you could like ask on every episode (that the app creators make) like 'what's your gender and preference to date' because all the creator made ones at like just girls, and I know males play as well. Not hating AT ALL,I LOVE this app SO MUCH! Just tryna help ya improve! Luv you episode! (Or make more that are inclusive of gender) MEOW LOVE U",
        "I really like 90% of this game. However, the way the passes are done really suck. I absolutely love when the 30 days unlimited ad free pass comes up for $9.99. Without it I practically refuse to play. It doesn't seem to be available as of a few days ago. I'm glad I recently purchased. Would also be cool to have a feature where you can send passes to friends.",
        "I love love love this game! Its really awesome to see the creativity and beauty in an interactive game. There are some things I would love to request; hairstyles. Yes there are lots and that's really awesome but if you could customize both the bangs of the hairstyle AND the back hairstyle. A more diverse set of actions and hand held items. Also, body types. I am a thin girl but it would be a whole lot more to stories if there were curvy girls and not totally buff guys. Speaking of males, male looks to me are more limited than female. Only in special stories are there more diverse male looks. Facial features such as freckles, or scars, moles, and other facial markings would be much appreciated. Gosh this is a lot but I really hope these can be added for a more realistic game play. I love the game and I hope this is seen and added in updates to come",
        "It's an ok app and this is my third time redownloading it, the character designs have gotten better but there only problem I have, the tickets, like really? 2 tickets? First it was 5, then 3, now only 2. Not everyone has money to waste on games, especially tickets, not only that but their overpriced, like any other add on pack/item. I wouldn't even be surprised if I deleted this and redownloaded back in a year and they only give you one ticket a day."

        "Was fun at first, then massive losing streak due to other players making every single shot perfect.  But most of the time when I start spending money I do better.  Odd.  I think I found a cheater during a putt.  He lined up correctly, however with the power he should have missed the hole.  I tried to watch the replay, but it is the only replay unavailable.  Then when we do the tie breaker shootout, he hits with pinpoint accuracy on the edge of the rough/fairway to get within 2 ft of the hole.",
        "After playing for a while it just isn't that great.  It shows too much of what other people are doing and then makes you go first.  I've now tried for a few months but honestly it's designed to make you spend cash.  I still play a little but constantly think about uninstalling it.  It gives you a free golden tee shot maybe once a week.  The rewards are meh... Because you know if you won too much you wouldn't need to spend real cash.  For the amount of rewards you get it should play the free golden tee shot 3 times a week.  The best feature is that you can save a shot and upload to YouTube easily.",
        "This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it's pretty awesome!",
        "Best game period. Not just golf or sports game, but any game. Wouldn't change a thing. All ya all who say, oh they need to change this or that, and why do I have to play someone who's better than me? Well it's because you suck, and you have no hand eye coordination. Just shut up and dribb, uh I mean play. #1 game for a reason peeps. Love ya. Dueces. Peace biatches.",
        "First of all I love the game, I play every day. I especially love the tournaments. But now I have to congratulate you guys, you are brilliant. You took a push one button to go between guest and Facebook accounts, and changed it to pushing 20 buttons. And now you have to leave the game and go to the Facebook app to push most of them. Apparently you're not happy about two accounts. I don't know why, I spend twice as much money.  Tech monkeys, gotta love 'em.",
        "I think most of the time i am actually playing against a computer and and not a real person . And the computer is programmed to make me lose so that i am forced  spend money on the game. The whole idea of gaming online is to have a friendly yet fair platfotn for people to enjoy and unwind.  So you based on the above very brief of the begining of the end fir companies such as yourselves... i would recommend the following simple advise free of charge.....  Safeguarding  the companies reputation is everything.  The future of gaming ,NOT INCLUDING casino/gambling type apps, will be based on trust and have a more family type target market, and thus should have different business models."

The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child&apos;s burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target&apos;s face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.<br><br>**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** <br>Launch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

And what are the power pellets  for 🤔??oh  no I can see Amy's under wear  and when shadow and Amy fall's  from the bonus  stuff or a boss when they land they run like sonic for two seconds and Amy run bad",
        "What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn't be playing it if I couldn't play as Pac-Man, he's such a good inclusion. It's a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you're prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.",
        "The game is really solid, serving as a great precursor to Speed Battle in terms of basic gameplay. The missions and occasional events really give the game some gameplay value and the music is a really nice tune, but it will get old not too long after you start playing. I think it's a shame that the characters have no differences; it's purely aesthetic. Different abilities for the characters would have rocked, and Speed Battle improved this slightly, but not much. It's definitely worth a play or two, but don't stick around too much, you're not missing much.",
        "Game looks good and it's well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m",
        "This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven't tried it. It's occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!",
        "Sonic Dash has a plethora of characters to unlock and play as. Some require real money, but most of them can be unlocked with Red Star Rings, and all of the characters can be won through events. You can even get Classic Sonic and Green Hill Zone! And every once in a while, they'll add some characters from different franchises to run as for a limited time, and if you unlock them, you'll be able to play as them forever."

However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.",
        "Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.",
        "I love this game.  The only home design game there is. Glad that that they have added items to the shelves more realistic.  Sometimes I feel it is over designed.  I wouldn't always add that footstool or bench.  It is also difficult to play without spending money and I cannot afford to do that.  Keys are required to decorate properly (plants, decor) and can take a long time to accumulate.  This is my favourite game though and I will continue to play and patiently wait just do my best with what I have.  I do watch the videos to gain more keys but woe is me...",
        "Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don't add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.",
        "The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I've purchased don't work it gives a message saying they couldn't find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT"

Good game controls are set up for the game to play at a different location in Liverpool and Wales and the club has won the championship.",
        "I absolutely loved the game, enough so to even pay for no ads, but it got rid of my highscore, all my hats and outfits, all of my upgrades, and just started fresh. Now I have ads again and I can't get rid of them even though I payed to have them removed. I feel ripped off. Edit: just lost my progress for a second time",
        "It's a pretty solid game the only thing worth mentioning is if you could imply that when you win a shirt that you actually have to pay for it. After a level when it pops up it seems free and I wasted 400 coins on shirts accidentally. Other than that its pretty good",
        "Great game, ads can be blocked without a connection to the internet, but if you're on a streak or attempting a challenge, using one for a continue is nice. I'm honestly addicted, shooting my little comrads to safety.",
        "I truly enjoyed this game. I have been playing frequently for about two weeks. I loaded the game to continue farming for stars to see everything has been wiped as if I just freshly installed it. Seems I'm not the only one this has happened to. Developer: restore what other individuals and I have bought and achieved please. Very unhappy",
        "This game does not have a casual mode so every time you play its time sensitive. This greatly reduced playability. Coupled with the most jerky aiming I have ever used brought this game down to a solid 2⭐."

        "Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don't want to see them.",
        "This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.",
        "Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad's are repeatedly played and I can't skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad's... after 2nd level game is very easy didn't find much interesting..",
        "This game is sooooo frustrating that the game made me through my phone on the ground. If you are good with controlling your stress then you should try it. But if your not good at controlling your stress then do not get it.",
        "Agree with other comments. Great graphics, fun to play, but the ADS!!!!!!!! eventually destroy the fun. Very repetitive after a while and challenge levels seem quite mixed. Have decided to delete the game mainly because of the ad onslaught. Other games have a much better ad/play psychology approach."

        "I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved",
        "This game was good and fine then it crashed and when I reopened it it had lost all my progress from level 36 to 21. What a waste of time so annoyed. How the hell do i get my game back? It looks like it connected to a Facebook account and loaded an old game but I don't gave the option to disconnect. So frustrated!",
        "I love this game, although It's not an instant gratification game, it's a fun for long term! Most stuff doesn't require real money, and the daily bonuses are great! I wish there was a way to sort the plants by amount you have, while planting.",

Please make an update where you can move these things while pets are out, or get my pet unstuck for me. Otherwise I won't be able to continue the game due the the inconvenience it's making.

        "Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that's by design so I spend money. Which I won't do. I just want some \"bubblegum\" to past the time.  Now, it's making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...  Oh, how I hate the legends arena stages...",
        "Why is it that when you add new levels, I get kicked back to the first round in the legends arena? Totally unfair that all the progress I've made gets completely erased. Now that this has happened for about the 3rd time, it makes me want to uninstall",
        "Love it. Addicting. Some levels were hard but by taking a break I'd usually get it when I went back to play or have my sister beat the level for me",

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says \"loading cantina\" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info."

        "You cannot walk on wooden fundations and you cannot walk on single or double foundations. Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it",
        "This is a very fun game. It got me hooked for hours. However, there are still some things that need improvement. For example, when walking sideways along fences you can get over them. This is an issue as once i did this and fell into the water not being able to get back on. Also, the spikes do not seem to have an effect on the shark so they are useless. I do believe that the developer needs to continue to work on this game and introduce new items and uses for them.",
        "It's honestly a pretty good game, it's fun, even though there's no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it's really bad, and it's insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.",

        "What a great game it is like a scaled down but easier version of ksp. Would love to be able to dock with other ships in orbit though. Also u should add a rover that can be launched off a ship and used to explore planets. On top of that u could create landmarks on planets such as caves or something! Overall a great game but would love to have more content! P.S any estimated date for when next update comes out?",
        "I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It's simple and I like it! Couldn't figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It's KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I'm sure that's on your list.",
        "So I've been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you're on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!",
        "I landed on the Moon and... I got back to Earth safely on manual control! What's with you, you think I'm expendable?! There is no way to add new destination once the original one is attained. Also it would be great to have a payload that can be carried other then the capsule alone. Other than this is the greatest fun I had in a while.",
        "I love it. The greatest game ever keeps your brain from stopping because this game is like a puzzle you need to think smartly, and build smartly. I want to thank you, from making this MASTERPIECE free. Please don.t ever add in game purchases not everyone has credit cards. You guys should download this game if your are bored. If does not takes up many spaces and ultimate fun and creativity.",
        "I love this game, i've been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You"

        "Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don't lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!",
        "This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there's no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.",
        "This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!"

Other then that issue, the game is great! It's a true 3d game, unlike some of the others I've played. Please fix the S-Pen issue, so I can enjoy this game on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.",
        "Horrible. The only reason people say its good is to get a reward in the beginning. This game is terrible it give viruses. It makes my phone slow and all this might just be my opinion but it really is a terrible game that I wouldn't recommend. One game everyone should get if they, yunno, ACTUALLY WANT FUN NON-VIRUS GAMES, is hellopets. And BTW sorry for the grammar and stuff I don't wanna go back and fix it.",
        "i would not recommend this game to anyone because 1. its hard to control  2. every time i press and slide it to color it makes this BZZT sound 3.their are WAY to many adds  4. not very many interesting pichers to color  lassed but not least  5. it wasseds time because sents it can move around it took me 1 hour to get ONE number done. i mean I really REALLY, don't recommend this game to ANYONE!!!",
        "It is very difficult to control.  I don't like that you have to pay for most of the pictures.  It's alright.  I think that it would be better if instead of paying for the pictures you have to watch an add.",
        "It's a great game bit, it is hard a little to play I think for if u don' t have good agility skills and yeah that's pretty much it it's a really good game though I think he's probably play it take my advice it's okay also there's another game that's great. Get the coloring game by numbers no. Draw it's a great game too and I think you should get it it's okay I mean like you can draw but it's not 3D I think you should maybe get it if you like to draw it's easier and you don't have to do it 3D. Get it now at your local app store or any app store. In my opinion I think you should get no. Draw because it's easier to draw with by numbers.",
        "Time waster  When I put time waster I didn't mean it waster your time but if you are waiting for something and you start playing this game time fly by.  It is also very relaxing."

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "Love this game, its an addictive time killer. But I would like to have replays and not sure if it's only my device because I haven't seen other reviews about it but it doesn't have an accurate count of flips, my friend counted 11 and it said 3.5 I do many more (yes at one time, before landing) and it still says 3, 3.5, 4",
        "Since the last update, being able to double up on coins from hourly balloons is impossible.  Also watching videos for coins isn't working.  This game is great when everything works right.  However, it is getting frustrating not being able to view videos for coins.  I'm game ad breaks are still working, so what's the deal?  The # 1 thing that keeps me in a game is not having to spend real money.  I a star simply because of this.  Fix it please.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them."

        "l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.",
        "Buggy.  The game itself was pretty good but there are issues with the cloud save deleting peoples games + all their in-app purchases (like me). The support for the game is non-existent. They have one email address to send issues to, and it's been weeks, almost a month, since and there has been no response. So everything is gone and they can't be bothered to try and restore my account for a month.   In short, it was fun and addictive, but your game will delete itself eventually and the support staff doesn't care since they already have your money.",
        "I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I've uncovered is covered by \"treasure chests\" and there's no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I've completely run out of space and can't play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they're not opened.",
        "Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I've not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it's a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.",
        "Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.",
        "This game is almost perfect!  I love almost everything about it, though it would be nice if chalices recharged faster, and dragon gems weren't so rare.  Also, since the latest update, levels will spontaneously crash the game if you play them too long, which is hard to avoid in some of the bigger levels. It really sucks to save up 7 chalices, just to have the level crash part way through and eat them all."

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",

Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Excellent game. Best Idle, if not best game period on the market. Not really P2W, just pay to speed up. Heroes are amazing, unique and cool. There are also lots of other things to do besides just idle and wait to get stronger. So much content and you're given free gems from watching adds. Doesn't make you pay to succeed or have fun. Literally no complaints. And that's coming from someone that just in general has an issue with 99% of mobile  games. Download this!",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don't waste it here. Good luck!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun."

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",

The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "As I have not heard of this game (it showed up in my recommendations), I would like to say that this game is beautiful! I do recommend other people to play it. The graphics are highly amazing and basic control is outstanding! I love the idea on how you can pick up items that you put down and rearrange your base the way you want it. Although, I did have several connection issues, but overall everything is in tiptop condition. Keep up the good work!",
        "It's a pretty fun game, I enjoy it more than Last Day on Earth. Unfortunately like many people, I find the energy system lacking. I understand the need to have it as developers but it makes the game hard to play more than once or twice a day. If you could implement an increase in energy through leveling it would made progression more worthwhile and keep people playing longer. It doesn't have to be a huge increase either, maybe one energy point per lever or even everyother level.",
        "I love the game, the crafting system is awesome, the gameplay is great. However, there are some points that I suggest  1. Nerf the Damned, also the Lepers, they are strong for beginners. Club or Cart Thills can't beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don't know if it is a bug to me or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It's a great game to be honest.  Edit: I love the events, especially the cart one.",
        "It's a good attempt but too easy to die. No water. Seriously? I have an empty bottle yet nothing to put in it. I would like the chance to explore and build BEFORE I die five times and can't reclaim the stuff I've spent time collecting.  If these things are remedied I'll try again. Till then, deleting.",
        "I normally dont make reviews on games that i play unless it is really good. I love the hardcore atmosphere of the game,reminds me of the good old days when i still like playing minecraft. My only complaint is that the spawn rates for the undead e.g leepers, templars are too high in my opinion. Other than that. This is a great game",
        "Honestly it's a great game and lots of fun but that energy mechanic needs to change. I know you can walk but it's still such a strange thing to gate your players out of playing.  Maybe if you could always travel at the same speed but if you didn't spend energy you could be attacked randomly while you travel. Or if energy was used to speed up crafting. I dunno but it's the only thing holding me back from a perfect score."

        "(REAL REVIEW! NOT A PAID REVIEWER) Really enjoying the game. It's a good time killer. Some levels are a lot of fun and actually require a little bit of skill. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is there are way too many ads. It will randomly make you watch a video to upgrade your ride or character, and/or to play a level. There's been a few times where I had enough tickets to play, and coins to upgrade my character the two points recommended, and I had to watch a video for all three. Three ads before you can even play a level is ridiculous. I understand that it's a big part of making money for the developers, but I've never had a free game with this many ads. Get rid of some of the ads and I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars.",

        "I'm 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",
        "I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I'm sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP",
        "I LOVE this app! And I'm so glad it's free! Everyone is like 'it's the same thing over and over again' but they're not actually getting into this game. They're are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!",
        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least",
        "This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I'm eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐"

        "I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It's fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn't want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.",
        "Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It's reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis's and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I'm offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,",
        "This game is have potential, don't ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I'd end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!",
        "Good game fun to play spent cash in-game. One issue my moat recent purchase I bought 4 boxes and a bundle of gems in a deal, I got the gems and one of the boxes then my game said there was an error and reloaded leaving me without my other boxes!!! Other than this it's a fun and easy game with little to no major issues",
        "Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things."

Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!",
        "I love this game there are so many games to play within.  One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn't give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star",

There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.",

The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what's the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?",
        "i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.",
        "It's a really fun game, but sometimes you'll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don't get another life afterwards. It's hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn't be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.",
        "The game itself is cool but the cloud sync system sucks. It doesn't even asks the user if the user wish to keep the current locally saved file to be saved to the cloud or be back to square one. I synced my wife's Google account to save my progress still on this phone even my wife's account is synced into it since I am about to hand over this phone to her & purchase a new device to myself. When I did so, the entire progress was totally wiped out & it came back from the start. Tried to synced my own account back but the game progress was totally gone! Hopefully I'll get the developers attention into this for them to get this fixed. It totally messed up the entire game progress!",
        "IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!",
        "OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can't stop playing it!"

It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless",
        "Touch screen Pacman never as good as joystick. This app way too many popup vid ads. Graphics not the greatest either. But offers several additional mazes and options than standard Pacman layout. The constant forced ads cause me to close app and play something else.",
        "Came for Sonic, stayed for a good game. I suggest adding new ways to use coins, like for different variations of pacman or the ghosts. The only complaint i have is the loading time is quite slow",

        "I am really surprised. The amount of new mazes I've never seen before just blows me away. Of course you can just play the classic version thats why I downloaded it but wow love this game. And you don't have to spend money unless you want to its very kick back. Adds of course but whats a dollar to you?",
        "Absolute tons of ads. The game is good, (not good Ole Mrs PacMan, though). But the vast number of ads, clearly shows no respect to the gamer. Uninstalling"

        "Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?",
        "I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)",
        "This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.",
        "This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it's so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can't find it 😑... the games the b💣mb. But the update I don't have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!",
        "Good for killing time. Some of the computer driven opponents seem to have a very decisive advantage at initial start of certain stages, and some of the smaller vehicles are too sensitive on the controls  but overall decent game.",
        "This game needs major fixes, on mission mode, I get my reward after completing a level but I can't ever go anywhere after it. So I never get to move on the next level. 😒"

The computer version is better but the mobile game is just as fun. But MSP listen to me, you NEED to let the mobile game bring the pets you buy with you in chat rooms. BC when I'm on this mobile game I can't bring my pet with me and its annoying. But other than that I LOVE THIS GAME!😘😘😘",

Maybe if you could add a lot of things from the PC version to the mobile device version things would be a lot more fun. Mainly Wishlists because they are really fun!

MEH AND HER A BFFFFFFFFFFFFFF'S!!!!",

        "Great time killer. The packs are expensive for the bs you get. I spent over $2000 on GOW due to the decent packs, but theres no way I'd buy any mafia city packs.",
        "Micro transactions are distroying games in every degree. Hey production and promoting team, hang yourself. This game is garbage",
        "Excellent game, very good graphics. I only started this to get tokens for another game. Wow, I can't stay off it. I now have my own crew and we are building. My advice? TRY THE GAME!!! you'll love it. I used to play iMobs on Storm8 but they shut the game down. This is better by a long chalk."

It made the app close constantly (even when it wasn't even open and I was in other apps), there's way too many ads that make me want to vomit, and it stats to lag now when it never did before. Someone at corporate ruined this game. Smh.",
        "Smooth control. Awesome idea . Not Much more I can say about it.(First Review). Now, my first thoughts about this game was that it was very good but as I have updated the game it has just been very slow and overturns when you tap. It also randomly takes you to the play store without tapping on an ad.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "Wow!!!! I've never been more annoyed with an app in my life!!! I would play this game all day long but the amount of ads are literally driving me insane! Two runs and another 15 second ad comes up. No thanks",
        "The game was awesome and I loved it. But the latest update ruined it with ADS. They put the banner exactly where you mostly tap with the fingers to change direction, the game got laggy which it was not before and has started getting way too many pop ups. Uninstalling. *Sigh*"

        "Great game! Awesome and enjoyable storyline, alongside with great characters! My favorite series is for sure the Campus Hacker books! Definitely recommend this app. Ads come up every so often, and you don't get very many passes, but other than that it's awesome!",
        "I like it, but can you just change how you have to wait 2 hours just to get another pass maybe 30 minutes I know that cuts it down an hour and a half, but still 30 minutes is still pretty long. There is one more thing can you make the chapters a little longer I sit down every day to read 1 or 2 good chapters, but I finish 5 minutes later! However, this is a great app, but if you can just fix those 2 things then I would enjoy the app more and it would be great!  Thank you",
        "In theory My shelf is a great idea 4 a library, Customable character & different stories 2 lose yourself in. Sadly it fails character creation in a way seems limited & graphics not that good, one chapter is about ten minutes long, and the cost of diamonds is ridiculous, & finally the waiting time for chapter loading is soooo long that I was fed up even before I began reading. This is a cheap 'CHOICES' knock off! My shelf u have to do better sorry.",
        "Could use more genre variety; Sci-fi, high fantasy, horror, crime mystery, but overall good. You should take all of your \"Shall We Date\" otome games & rerelease them through a single collection app like this, like your competitor Voltage Ent. is doing with theirs.",
        "Why it keep now downloading?? Waste my data, for waiting the progress... 😑 two books can't play, Untold darkness and Year book.. Please fix it that.. I like the review.",
        "Honesty from the heart.  (The Japanese developers created some beautiful copycat creation. You kinda did. Even your title showcase two western games from Google gameplay.  Something this game strongly lack is uniqueness .)  1. The stories isn't eyecatching,  longer and interesting for me to glue on the phone screen.  2. Beauty standard is the same like every anime characters with strange mixture of 90's vibe of Beverley Hills/bougie preppy style.  Ugh. No unique character creation: hairstyle, facial structure, eye color,  beauty marks, diversity, etc.  Everybody looks like eurasian version of final fantasyby drawing aid guide.  I highly appreciate Canada/American developers for games like Choices (fave) /Episode/Story to design uniqueness in one package.  3. Where the free diamonds. I know it is a pay to play game. Aleast the another games give you free stuff as starter pack for the gamer's feet to get wet. Your cost of diamonds /coins is expensive than donut in New York. Only good thing about this game is coding and beautiful graphics. Just with otome game market or release otome game collection.  I really love your another games.  Its painful to write a negative mark on this one."

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",
        "This is game is ok if you are bored and don't know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game",
        "I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat",
        "It is a great and fun game. Challenging and it works on your patience and timing. However it deleted all my progress for some reason and I lost all of the obstacles I unlocked, which was a lot",
        "This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you"

I'm not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that's just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!",
        "This is a great game... You should play it if you like gymnastics and if you are board,You   should download this game... Is very fun... I liked it... But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!",
        "I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the 'X' button it shouldn't show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!",
        "This is from my daughter, \"I like the game but there's some things about it I kind of don't understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she's practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot.\"   This is from me, \"the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it's fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall.\"",
        "It was reqlly fun to play but it really repetitive doing the same thing! I wish the  vault and beam comes out and maybe a freeplay side of the game then a stroy and aslo bigger events!",
        "Really was enjoying this app, then about 10 minutes in video ads started popping in literally every 1 or 2 minutes. This totally killed the fun factor; not only was I unable to complete any tasks or just enjoy the game but the crummy ads actually kept booting me off the app. What a complete buzz kill; even tho this app was super cute & the graphics were total eye candy, the constant interruptions barging in were beyond ridiculous; both in longevity & frequency."

        "lnstaII 'VEARN' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn't come back in the next game, but it's understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it's currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they're not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that's the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don't get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could've bought something else with it but I didn't because I like sims.",
        "First, I don't like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don't like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you're just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!",
        "im not sure what's the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they're walking, they legs dont even move! it's like they're flying, plus when they're doing any action like \"clean the dishes\", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).",
        "For the fact that we can't sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it's a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it's in the real The Sims games.",
        "Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools \"playable\",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it'd be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative."

        "Such a great and fun game but you can't do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.",
        "The pop-up ads trying to get you to spend money on the game that happen every time you open the game are annoying.  Also annoying that there are so many new missions that you can never finish one before a new one starts and if you do the missions you never have time to work on your own island.  This game is nothing like the pictures suggest for this app.  I thought there would be adventure and puzzles.  It's a glorified Farmville without the interaction of other neighboring farms (or islands in this case).  Still, it's addicting and frustrating that I can never clear those little missions that line up on the side of the screen.  There isn't enough time in life to finish them.",
        "I like the game, it helps pass time. My only complaint is you make it super hard to do anything without having tonso3ns real money. Which is ridiculous. I get that you need to make money off of this, but don't be so ridiculous about it.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Not spent a penny on it yet and managing alright to do tasks etc in a reasonable time. Though I've not completed a quest yet but that could be me not getting back to the game regularly enough. That's my issue though.",
        "It's not my favourite game because resources take FOREVER to get. I cannot spend real money and its expensive to purchase the package. It's so difficult to get diamonds and other resources. Please make it easier to get the needed items for the events.  PLEASE  !"

        "Super duper fun game,  loved it, still loving it. I managed to actually hold the ak47 correctly with my hand on the handle, same with the pistol. Just one minor complaint though,  the controls are supposed to be hard, yes,  and they are,  in a fun way, but the rotating hand control joystick seems to be inverted somehow,  could you possibly fix the rotating controls a bit,  it really throughs me off being it seems like one of the the Y axis is inverted, but not the X axis? Correct me if I'm wrong but I think that's the problem. Maybe add settings? Love the game,  and I've been playing it for a while,  nice job.",
        "I like this game but the sensitively is a little wild but that's to be expected with a game like this and the multiplayer is a really good idea but I can't get on if for some reason please fix this and keep up the great work you guys",
        "It is an awesome game I love it but on multiplayer you need to make it where you can write stuff to the other guy, please put that in the game.",

        "The game has the same problems as the other versions. The events boost strong players which makes the gap in strength larger. The premium items are overpriced. Probably the worst I have seen, there is no protection for your silver. This means stronger players always have a reason to attack someone weaker and there is no protection in place after being successfully attacked.",
        "The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I've literally been zeroed out because the app won't let me log in... multiple times. It's absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.",
        "Was never able to connect to even set up an account to try the game. Messages to support only returned with irrelevant form letters. Tried my Wi-Fi, data, and Wi-Fi at Att store. No luck and can't get an actual human to respond just a form letter telling me to uninstall, reinstall, use different Wi-Fi or get a different phone. All to try their game. LOL If that's the support you get when you are a perspective customer, imagine the \"help\" if they already have you hooked on their game. STAY AWAY!  (Galaxy S-7 Active Phone)"

        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don't even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.",
        "Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn't be putting people in the \"club\" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this \"club\" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they're INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game",
        "I liked the game overall. But, I think that there are too many buttons that do different things. Also, why do you only have 7 coins, but you need to use 2 in order to actually PLAY THE GAME!?!? It was OKAY. But I still don't know my honest opinion on this, but I would NOT use this comment as judging this game."

        "Ah perfect game. Fast pace not laggy smooth graphics, and playable on any devices. But i hope i can change my region like asian.. Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "For all this time I only played girly game like The Sims, Temple Run, etc but I decided to give this game a shot earlier today. GOD how I wish I tried it earlier! This is like the best game I've played in years, it's super playable even for someone like me (who have never played this kind of games before) and I just cant believe just how much this game has to offer! The graphic is flawless, no bugs or errors at all, the control is perfect, and it's superrr realistic. This game reminds me of Hunger Game lol. I feel emotionally exhausted while playing this game because I was always in a state of running and surviving. Very recommended!",
        "I love this game, today i jus download the game, cause my friend ask me tooo download this game and he also said it was fun! So I download it, and he was correct, this game is fun, I just become level 4! Not so soon I will become level 5! Yay for me😁 And I already bought the 1500 Diamond suit! It is so expensive!😲 but I just want to show  I am not a noob and I like to show at people who dosen't heve it, lol😂 and also I loved the game very much, so thank you for making this game and shout out to my friend Imbran! And bye😁",
        "The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It's intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it's voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.",
        "Best game ever!!! I like it so much. But the only thing that I hate is that I can't play with my friends sometimes, when I open the microphone before the game starts it kicks me out of the game to the menu. Another thing that I don't like it's that there is not a way to earn diamonds. One think I would like to change is too add more players, a  100 would be nice because the map is big. If this game improves the graphics it will be the best game available in play store.",
        "I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you'll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later."

If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "It's an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It's all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p"

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!",
        "I love playing this game but id give it no stars seeming that there are so many ads and when I collected enough stars for a ghost bike I DIDNT GET IT!! HORRIBLE!! unless you can fix this, you're not getting a good review on my hand. Oh and also, for anyone wanting to know, it's 21 dollars a month for some bikes. Not in real life. Wow such a great deal... No really a great deal."

        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.",
        "Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn't seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.",
        "I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I'm very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn't get my prize and I'm really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I'm expecting my prize from you. I really love this game."

        "Why did bubblegum hill disappear in the middle of the day today? Also the power ups are not staying the allotted amount of time either? I've spent money on this app but won't spend anymore!",
        "The game is fun, but customer support is terrible. I've had a number of issues with booster bonuses - infinite boosters are activated for 2 hours or more, but after a short time they vanish. I get no reasonable response, nor effort to make up for lost items, from support team.",
        "Stuck at level 705 no more levels available? Everytime I load the app it tells me I'm not connected and to go online to download more episodes, I'm obviously connected on my device or I wouldn't be here.(update) Stuck back at level 705 again can't get past it to the level I'm actually at so annoyed, it's now been 20 plus days of this issue can't even play the game unless I want to play levels I've already done what is going on fix this already!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yet another update and still the same issue, it's been a month or longer starting to think this won't be fixed total bs",
        "After this last update bubblegum hill mini game just disappeared. We hardly get this mini game anymore and now when it's finally here   it just disappears. And it used to be 2 days now it's only 1 day. Why. It's such a nice mini game and u ruined it by giving it only now and then and reduced the time to play it. Bring back the way it was.",
        "Last update make it run very slow and I back about 5 lebel earlier. But the most anooying is the game now has sucks motion like the device is not capable to  Play it. I'm using samsung tab s2 and I believe it has enough spec, at it has before the last update",
        "I was really enjoying this game! But lately all of my bonus items disappeared (over 30 of each item) and today bubblegum hill disappeared after the update. It's becoming increasingly frustrating"

        "The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.",
        "This game is a solid mix of \"clash of clans\" and \"fallout shelter\". Just like COC, you have to learn to let the timers cool off. The long term time investment can be very rewarding. The questing/pvp is also well done considering you can't choose what to attack or when during battle. Wholeheartedly a good game.",
        "Would be a great game if it wasn't blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can't defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don't get attacked too much and lose all your resources.",
        "GG easy. everyone whining being pay to play this that. i never bought anything and I'm loving this, just need a little patience and you can do many things untill one thing gets done or upgraded. I'm high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.",
        "The pay to win has gotten a little annoying for me especially the price they want. Fun game but you don't pay then you will not get as far as everyone else and will always be outmatched. Still having fun though just know I will never win PVP or tournaments or go to high in portals therefore ensuring I don't get good gear in either portal Store or tournament store.",
        "Honestly, a very fun take on base management and tactical combat games. Plus pretty funny dialogue and entertaining concepts. Like if old time wars and legends had Twitter pages to troll each other with...that kind of humor. Refreshing."

        "It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won't work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don't mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!",
        "I have only had this game for a few days, so I can't write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it's up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.",
        "Most awesome wolf simulator game I have ever played! The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the controls are pretty good. Although getting attacked by several animals at once when you only go for one makes completing missions pretty hard. And you should be able to run from a fight if you're losing, instead of having animals come at you until you're dead. All in all a great game play experience though. I love it!",
        "Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there's a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)",
        "Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don't think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.",
        "Most realistic wolf sim I have found out there, with the ability to get a mate, have cubs and your own den in which you can invite players into. There are also multiplayer game servers and an ability to create your own public or private game. You can also play as a wolf, fox or lynx and customize eyes, pelts and add masks/hats and scars/clothing. Its just AMAZING! Also saying that you don't have to pay to play and in-game currency is easy to get."

        "Excellent game, but every single update comes with a glitch to my base.This time it seems that anyone could open my chest from outside a level 3 wall without breaking the wall. This is great for the raiders but not for me... hope they fix this bug,. Before I go raiding and loose  a lot of stuff.",
        "This game is highly addictive. The challenges are hard but not impossible. You need patience...and planning. The Chinese new year's event made me used to the shortened energy usage, now that it's back to normal, just doesn't seem to be enough. But maybe that's where the patience comes in. Great game overall, really enjoying it. However finding copper is near impossible on any maps, but it's needed for a bigger backpack and what not.. this is a real pain in the proverbial but..",
        "Love this game but need more improvements. Speedily travel is too costly and energy ⚡ restore time is too slow. Please reduce energy ⚡ restore time 4 minutes to 1 minute and also the one hour reward gives us only 1 coin every time none other then item. Please do something about it . The event name Chanies happy new year is too good bcz it were reduced the energy consumption up to 50%. Please get back it or do something like this.  Please remind it on next update.",
        "This suck big time!!! there is a stupid update that keep on popping up in the middle of my game play. I,ve update that @&/&@(/& thing like 10 times. 39. ..... somting MB i have a uncap line so data dont bother me at all but if i must upgrade a f $&/@($ game 5 times in one night in the middle of my attack ... That makes me angry.  waist of my time",
        "Love it but would be better if I didn't lose all my stuff when I die. Sometime when I go to an area and die then return my body is not there only to lose every thing.  Should also be a way to fix weapons and armor. Melee weapon.. perhaps add a fix option for lol 40 stuff",
        "The game is awesome! But collecting stuff like engine part , wrench,bolts are a huge headache . What do we need 20 engine part for building chopper [Bike] ????? Atleast be realistic. Soon i will be buying iphone so add a feature where i can link my android account to ios bcoz i got a progress of last 6 months and i don't wanna loose it.........."

        "I'm totally addicted to this game! great graphics and lots of fun games that really make you think.  I just wish that it used up lives rather than credits because the credits can run out so fast and take a while to build the pot up again unless you want to pay £",
        "It's a really fun and addictive game with one major flaw. After you start getting to the harder levels, you might as well quit and find a new game unless you only want to play one or two rounds an hour or pay to play. Every level costs coins to play and if you fail a level you are out pretty much your whole hourly allotment of coins. Winning a round doesn't make up for even one loss either. Love the game,  but really annoyed that I can't actually play it consistently enough to truly enjoy it.",
        "The game is so much fun and great game play and graphics, etc. But it has one fatal flaw. When you get to higher levels, it becomes way too expensive. I paid for extra credits twice but then realized how worthless it is. Sad because I'd be willing to pay for packages for bonuses but it's way too expensive to have to keep paying for rounds just to play.",
        "Love it and it really made  my brain thinking like do I want to risk lose money on wild card or go ahead to pick card from deck. When I won love that dog jump over three stars. I try to recalled did dog jump over two or one star. Maybe not. But still love it. Keep it coming",
        "Once you get to the higher levels, it gets really expensive, and each game costs coins. Sometimes it takes 5 or 6 tries to pass a level. There should be another way to earn coins. Beautiful game, love to play, just too expensive.",
        "This Solitare game is more complicated than I had anticipated which makes it more challenging. It looks easy but I looked up & my challenge coins were decreasing rapidly. Hmm...?"

My only gripe is that the squares or hexes are too small so it is very hard to navigate the puzzle without breaking previous connections. My other issue is that at times connections randomly disconnect. Fixing these issues would make the game more relaxing",

Could not play it for more than a couple of seconds. Otherwise it was great at first before it started doing this. Is this a glitch that can be fixed please?",
        "It's so addicting and fun. Really makes your brain work. Though when your playing, chances are that your friend sitting next to you will jut their finger in there if your stuck on a puzzle. Not my problem, I don't have any friends. Still fun",

These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Edit: New horrible LOUD advertising you can't stop. Very disturbing to others and prevents usage around others.   Great puzzle games, lots of levels from easy to very hard. However it will eat your battery like there is no tomorrow. If your phone is plugged in, it will overheat. Use for more than about 15 minutes and your phone will burn your hand and shut down.",
        "After we have used the given 3 hints there is no way we can earn more hints e.g. by watching ads or waiting for some hours,etc. We have to purchase the hint with our real money. Nowhere the game gives you warning that once you use all 3 hints then you will have to purchase it Also once we are stuck at one level we cannot skip and go to next level. Apart from that its a good game."

Any time I try to use the joystick it would go to another place on the screen, and other times would make my blob automatically go somewhere without me even using the joystick. If it is just my device making the game buggy then is it still possible to fix somehow? Please let me know.",
        "Using the tiny arrow to find the proper time to split and absorb someone is very difficult. I wish there was a thin line that stretches farther. You need cross compatability between PC and smart phones. Also, you constantly beg us to buy stuff AND you have alot of annoying ads. Be like clash of clans and just sell stuff. Yall are too money hungry for a game that isn't even that good.",
        "Ok. are you kidding me? i payed my money to get rid of advertisement and all the sudden it reappears again. i purchased some coins to get rid of advertisement and its still there. BEWARE PLAYERS: this is a bait. it wont made the ads go away. ads will also appear out of nowhere during my gameplay. delete it now",
        "What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can't even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it's nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it's really irritating",
        "Used to be a fun game but unfortunately it no longer works. Game has you waste your coins on quests which you complete and then you receive no reward for some reason. You're supposed to get free coins but about half the time you don't actually get it after you click the button. I wasted 90 coins and complete a quest and then I received nothing but it clearly thinks I completed the quest because I need to pay another 90 coins to get a new Quest. This is happen like half the time! Sometimes I get no XP for some reason. I don't know what happened to this game",
        "This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn't even understand how the game works. Always saying \"connection is slow\" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there."

        "As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It's not really fair for those who aren't of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there's a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.",
        "In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I've played so far. Thank you makers!",
        "I've been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It's so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It's absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn't less if you don't. A high quality and fun game. I adore it"

It would be really nice if you can choose to dump any of the chests you don't want. Or swap out the ones you have in stock for the newly acquired better ones after a ranked match. Other than that, awesome game",

My only problem is that sometimes people do not want to, not do not have the ability to create a facebook account.

        "This game would be awesome if it matched you with people equal to your level but it doesn't. So I spend more time trying to get to the higher levels and not able to upgrade equipment. Of course you could always purchase money but I'm not big on doibg that!",
        "Fun game. But you definitely have things to fix. Like the fact that sometimes when you win, you still lose. And I'm not talking about having less gems. I'm talking  when the other player doesn't even in the hole. Definitely a glitch. Also, as far as controls....easy enough. But sometimes while I'm in the middle of a backswing, the ball will shoot on it's own without me releasing it. Which sucks because it's a wasted shot and usually costs you the match.

I hit things that aren't there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.",

Rest it's surely one of the best game of EA and undoubtedly for the football lovers..Keep updating... I would like it more if you improve the physics of the game like curving the ball etc....please make it....",
        "The game in my opinion is very rewarding. For example you get an Elite Cristiano Ronaldo at the beginning but they could add multiple updates to make it better. I actually have a no like about this game which is that it drains your battery usage fast and that's not good. The overall of the game is OK but they can add updates to make it better.",
        "The only I wanted to tell is that the game shows that the master players are very rare and we have a chance of getting them but trust I have been playing fifa for a lot of time and I never got like a player in like chance or in free packs I do not even get silver players. So I suggest that you increase the chances of getting these kind of players.",
        "At first when I down loaded it I thought it would be a cheap version of real FIFA that you often have to pay for. I expected bad graphics, crashes and lots of bugs. I WAS WRONG!!! This game is literally the best ever. 01.03.18 Although in the new update I went to type something on leagues and the game just crashed, it also made my phone spam so I had to shut it down and reload my phone up, please investigate this.",
        "After the last update, vs attack mode has become more frustrating. Before update I could compete with teams with higher rating. Now I'm losing to teams lower than me. The camera angle at corners is terrible. How did you make it worse? Before update would have given it a five star rating, now three.",
        "Vs mod is so bad after update. I have ovr 99. After update i lost many games from some guys who have ovr 94-95 because u didn't give me as many great chances as u predict. Once i played against 98 ovr player. He had 2 great and 6 good chances, i had 6 good chances and 0 great. It isnt ok."

Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",

I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

    "description" : "Mazes & More is a classic maze/labyrinth puzzle for kids and adults with fun tweaks and surprises. Just swipe your finger and guide the dot through the walls to find a way out and escape the labyrinth.

        "I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels \"fixed\" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.",
        "This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.",
        "I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn't really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don't know how many more points you need.",
        "This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don't like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.",
        "Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the \"boards\" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it's addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It's becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.",
        "I don't know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I'll say that. I didn't need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I'm out."

        "Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I'm very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Really annoying when ads pop up and you have to start from scratch. That's really my only complaint about this game, but it's a big complaint. It sucks to feel like you get really far and then all of a sudden it stops in the middle of the game. This is a finished game not an interactive advertisement where it stops you from going further.  In all honestly it plays simply and I like it a lot but it needs some improvements.",
        "I like the game a lot but it would be nice if there was a way to take back or redo your last move. There's been times that while I'm playing, the piece I'm placing ends up 1 square off from where I wanted it to go. Situations like that is where a \"redo\" or \"do over\" option would be very helpful and greatly appreciated. If you were to add that, it'd be a 5 star game for sure. Also some other colors options that didn't cost money would be great too! Other than those couple of things, keep up the great work you guys!",

        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it."

        "I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",
        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups",
        "This game is the WORST!!! The controls don't work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot",
        "It's honestly a fun game, and I'd love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it's just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that's a problem. I'm not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It'd be five stars if it didn't give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn't worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try \"Run\". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)"

        "PRACTICALLY AMAZING!!!!! THE BESTEST COCO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!! I have played many coco games, (almost all of them) but this one is the bestest of them all (if that's a word 😜) mainly because A LOT is unlocked including the SPA!!! (Crazy, right?!?!?!) and there are so many things to do. Plus it also reminds me of subway surfers..... The one thing I love besides the spa, is the restaurant. As far as I know, only fitness girl has that..... So definetly, it's a plus..... 👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍😋",

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "Amazing game reminds me of the old school games . But the only problem is the lives you give us to play. They are so few and they take a lot of time to refill. PLEASE remove the life or ball things from this game it will be the best if you do that cause I was playing and level by level I was getting exited and I wanted to rate this game 5 stars but suddenly this GAME OVER thing comes and I had to give you this ratings.please let us play without stopping and waiting for the life to come."

        "I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.",
        "Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren't enough. And one of them didn't work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.",
        "It's fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I'm bored. I love the songs and dance moves it's awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it's awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don't know how to dance then you should download this game it's perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.",
        "Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn't have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!",
        "I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn't make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.",
        "After actualization you can't make money you have to wait 24 hours until you can make money an you'll get 100 and the limit is 200 and there are no free songs. Before the actualization I had 350 coins when i turned it on I had only 250 and i can't even use the 50 because the songs cost 100!"

This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",
        "Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I'm actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it's quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun",
        "Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",
        "It's a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don't like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀"

About the ads: I have premium, and I only have to watch an ad if I choose to get a reward in return. There are no sudde, unwanted or random ads anymore.",
        "Simple game. Ads galore. Also when ads pop up better not be listening to music because it's gonna pause your music even if the ad has 0 sound. Thus the one star rating. You can advertise all you want but don't interrupt any background apps to force me to look at your ad. That's just messed up.",
        "Not the most challenging game but its okay if you need something to do on the toilet. Unfortunately there is only ONE menu to open for the entire game and every time you click on it you are forced to watch an advert. EVERY TIME!!! i wouldnt give this game 5 stars in a hurry but the constant bombardment of adverts kills what would otherwise be a far mkre decent game.  Side note: yes i know there is a premium version which is basically the same game but without ads. This isnt a game i would spend money on and definately not (at least to me) worth killing with adverts.",
        "First of all the game it self is a great little game. Graphics are fine game play is simple and easy to pick up it's a good game. Now for the reason it only gets two stars. WAY TO MANY ADS! I mean for f@$k sake every two seconds there's an ad. Click on the car buying button there's an ad. Sit there to long there's an ad. I understand this is how you make your money but come on there's a line and you didn't just cross it you swan dived over that bad boy. I'm sorry but I do not recommended this game for anyone.",
        "Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there's a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.",
        "Not had too much of a problem with ads, but that might be because my game doesn't progress after dragging the car onto the race track.  Just keeps going in circles, and won't allow me to remove it after track, no matter if its gone pass finish line or not."

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long.",
        "I think that there could be less ads. When I'm trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads",
        "A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine's) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I'm unsure it this is the game or my phone."

        "Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D",
        "Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I'm sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.",
        "Brilliant! It is absolutely fantastic! Bit of lag and ads but apart from that it's perfect. Also it's very different from the other dumb ways to day which goes to show how much effort the creator(s) put into making them.They didn't just quickly make a few quick games for the money. No. They put effort. It is amazing. The deaths are funny and the characters are cute and so is the art style. Creator, GREAT JOB!!!",
        "Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that's all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS",
        "The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.",
        "I loved the other two games and this one is no exception.I've just been wondering what's meant to happen after you press pledge on the little red thing?also there should be more minigames.Is there an update coming soon with a new location?(I've completed all of them)"

Now the game starts but then it’s unresponsive to any input (controller, remote, keyboard). Other games work normally. I tried everything. Running latest version of OS, cleared game cash, game data, uninstalled game, restarted Nvidia Shield then reinstalled game. Same thing, not accepting any other input.  If this problem is resolved, I will edit my review back to 5 stars since I love the game.",

And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I'd love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right.

Controls are very bad and graphics also. The only thing that makes it more fun is the online challenges, but other than that this game sucks. I would expect a whole lot more from Red Bull.",

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars",

        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although…                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads…ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It’s still great!"

You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",

It's a cicle keep us the client happy and we for sure will come back every time.Its fake chips not real  guys. .  please give us a reason to come back for more. So sad I deleted  both my apps. When I go there I want  be happy not worry that my 17.7b will be gone in 60seconds playing Roulette",

I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better.",

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",
        "Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn't respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn't know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn't be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.",
        "Game is good graphics are also good but it tends to get crash several times when I played it. I have a moto g5 plus phone with 4gb ram and adreno 508 GPU and all the games played very smoothly in my phone even asphalt 8 also ,i don't think so it's my phone who is not handling the game so there should be some bugs in this game  please fix as soon as possible.",
        "The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don't close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid."

I kinda felt like it was a lot shorter then the other games. But other then that I had fun playing it and I'm super excited for other to come out so hurryyy!!!!!!! Lol",
        "This is just like the other game you guys made, the one with the doctor in the hospital, down to the exact same thing of \"play the first couple of levels for free but if you like you pay\" I bet this one is for the same price. On a side note, the story is different but the game play is the same, go have a look if you want. I will say this is a good game and I take nothing away from the hard work you have done. Good looking graphics, good smooth game play. A game you can get into and do try the other games of this developers you may like it as well. Over all a good game I just do not think it is worth $15. But best of luck guys.",
        "Thanks thanks thanks!!! I have played many of the Emily's and Hearts games.. I bought many of them as well. I understand the cost of making these awesome games with beautiful graphics... but I'm happy you are also thinking of your fan's pockets this time. Thanks for giving us the option to choose to buy a full version or keep playing free with ads for this games. I read the options several times, couldn't believe my eyes .. thanks thanks!!!😍😍😍",
        "Great game  I don't normally spend the Ching on many games. . This has a different take of an old favorite.  But none of the challenge levels are working on my game.  Once it's over, nothing happens.  I don't get credit for work achieved and I have to restart with same result. A glitch. Waiting for update",
        "Love these games. I've purchased them all from different sagas. I'm just encountering a  problem with this one in particular. At the end of every challenge it glitches and I can't get my rewards. It stays on the challenge and I have to go back to the menu and play again. Pretty frustrating. Hoping it can be resolved.",
        "It was great except for the adds of course. waste of time. I got to lvl 60 after playing lvl 60 it will just close and crush. please help! is level 60 the last level? y am is the app crushing??"

        "Why advertise the game as \"free\" when it really isn't?  You can only get so far with the \"free ponies\" before you hit a pay wall that requires parents to purchase additional ponies to finish the quest.  The reason I say \"free ponies\" is that your child is subjected to a ridiculous amount of ads in order to play. The only way to get rid of the ads is to buy the ponies.  Even though my daughter loves the game and it's easy for a 5 year old to play, I had to uninstall it due to the ad content.  You really should be more careful who you solicit ads from for content designed for children under 8.",
        "This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It's definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.",
        "Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn't be EA'd. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.",
        "Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.",
        "Remove the paywall and just charge for the game, it's worth it and people will buy it. But the way you can't unlock ponies without paying is insulting. Such a shame... I'll be sure to avoid any games you make in the future. And, yes, that's a bit harsh. But if we all don't stop letting devs get away with this kind of thing every company will turn into EA and will ruin the fun of gaming."

        "love this game!! The control are easy, the graphics are amazing, really well made!!! I would LOVE to see some BIG updates soon, like able to somehow earn gold plz?!?! And maybe have a little more variation of parts u can change. And hopefully some new tracks will come out Right?!? But GREAT JOB to the developers and everyone who put effort into this game. Thx guys  :D",
        "good improvements, make more tracks and some challenges to do. also remove rocket bunny cars and make just rocket bunny parts, make more parts, last exhaust is curved but flame goes straight, let us tune engine by putting different parts, like intercooler and turbo, let us change tire graphics, also let us put different wheels on front and back. this game got very big potential, try to involve some multiplayer, with ghosts and rankings, or open multiplayer room for more users live. high graphic option need very powerfull phone, my nexus5 doing 10fps, on medium i got stable 30fps. after update i had to buy last track even when i buyed it before, save file keeps my cars but no track data. let us make layouta for parking track. thanks and thumbs up for you :)",
        "Well... Ive bought all the cars that you can without gold... All you have to do is get to 50x and you will have around 120,000cr and thats enough to buy all the cars... And put what you want on it... Add more cars and add tuning, also remove the god damm machine gun exhaust not all drift cars do that... Fix it because its annoying and it also over powers the sound of the car...",
        "Iv been looking for a desent drift game for ages and now i found it. It has great gameplay and controls and good grafix to this game has hella potentual keep up the good work i cant wait for future updates IL RATE THIS GAME 11/10",
        "I know I said that this game is one of the best but I'm not so sure now. One of the reasons for that is that the buttons need to be customisable while playing the game because I can't seem to press the turn button at the right time because my thumb is not where I need it to be ( plus I need it to be bigger) and you guys have retracted the CR mode for purchasing Nissan GTR r35 and Ferrari 458 Italia as well as the Mercedes AMG c63 and the BMW M4 rocket. Bring back the CR mode for purchase of these vehicles. At least for the Nissan GTR r35 please",
        "Loved it, but the game needs 5.  1 make an easier way to get gold you know what i mean because you can only buy gold with real money and that isn't a good deal in my opinion. 2. Our player needs to be removable because he gets in the way. 3 please add the Lamborghini Gallardo and  Aventador. 4 add Ferrari. 5 make cars buyable with cash too. Thank you I hope this game clims to the top of the charts. Bye"

        "Its a good game, i like this kind of games and i love when i play with friends too! The game its really easy to play, a strategy game and simply as destroy the enemy base... Love it! Its true that not all are going to like this but for me this game its 5 stars. Btw i have started the game and i said i love to play with friends, does this game has a Couple/Duo match to play with them (Not versus them). Thanks in advice, keep staying great!!",
        "The game is okay it has a lot of faults. The matching system is horrible it always puts me against people that are hundreds of levels higher than me. And somehow their money regenerate quicker and they're able to send  out more and bigger and better units out on the battlefield. Even when the matchmaking system puts me against somebody my own level their money regenerates quicker than mine and they send out a lot more units faster than I can for whatever reason. Uninstalling this game",
        "I absolutely love this game! As a person who enjoys strategy games, from RTS such as Stronghold, Supreme Commander, and C&C, this game takes my top 3 for the phone. The match making system is very good at keeping same skilled players together, as well as it isn't very much a pay to win game. The units are decently balanced and the game isn't to slow or fast. Definitely a game I will keep playing for a long time. I do want to ask, if you guys will be putting in a \"survival mode\", and withstand against waves of enemies. Great job FourThirtyThree",
        "I'll update whenever I can actually play the game. It's up to date. I get to the screen that asks if I'd like to use my Google account or Facebook account. I do not have a Facebook. Obviously I have a Google account. I'm writing this review. I click Google and both options disappear. It sets at that screen where the two options were previously available and nothing happens. I made sure to wait around 5 mins to see if it was a loading issue.. dunno. I'd love to try out the game.",
        "really good game i love it but just some ideas that might make it even better (I think the menu on the left side could have a higher contrast (text and background)or I think the trophy chest amount could be adjusted to the player amount in the clan +to participate in trophy chest you have to be in the clan since it started (midnight)please do some balance changes soon... some untis don't feel to be used enough or some just are OP like the steel saw mech or another idea :to have some way to delete (locked) chests )please reply if you (4:33)see it and want to give a statement",
        "This game is awesome, it reminds me of Guns Up! . The ONLY thing I don't like about it is it's basically pay to win. I only have 5 slots to open chests and it cost gems to open the chest and money to get gems. Other than that, the gameplay is solid. It's very unique in it's actually a wonderfully crafted game and not some thrown together garbage. I probably will end up throwing money at it only because it's made so we'll. But like I said I do feel the process for opening chests is a bit too cash hungry..."

I would like to see mpre options for alliances in the future. Perhaps a deceptions option list where you can try to steal from other players without fighting. Stuff like that.   Otherwise enjoyable.",
        "It has a few bugs. I had a game and didn't realise I had to sync it with my FB account to save it. I spent money to progress in the game and I was at house level 12 I think. I did an upgrade for the shrine and after the upgrade it said I didnt have an internet connection. So after many attempts I just deleted the app and downloaded it again and lost everything. Now my recommended tasks are stuck at upgrade stable level 7.",
        "Absolutely full of bugs, glitches, awful service and not worth the free download. Have wasted so much $$$ on packs and lost this due to glitches and faults in game. Developers refuse to even respond to tickets now, terrible customers service, especially towards paying customers. Do not recommend. Overpriced and faulty packs and faulty game mechanics.",
        "This game has a lot of glitches but it has gotten better. I would rate it higher but the material for crafting certain gear is rarely available. If the events for these materials were done more often it would be great as everything takes a lot of resources and time to do even for lower levels.",
        "Game play is ok. Graphics are pretty good but the constant attacks by higher players really kill game play especially when it takes so many resources to heal al your troops. Wish the healing cosy could be fixed but Moore than likely not. Will not recommend this game.",
        "I am very happy to play this game but like other people I have seen on here, I too lost my game!! I was at keep level 16 but due to bugs, the game would not open so I reinstalled and lost my account. I have sent tickets to customer services but I am yet to receive a reply or any form of acknowledgement. I know somebody else who it happened to and although she could not get her account back, she was credited with gold to help her continue in the game. I don't understand why some people get good service and others do not?!"

        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "For a shoot 'em up racing android game it's really addictive. I'm always playing it. It's fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!",
        "I really enjoyed this game until it started crashing mid game. Happened to me just recently and I wasted all my available fuel trying to frantically restart the game.  I was just completing the assigned jobs when the game suddenly stalled and I had to restart it again just to find it stalling again, all the while consuming the fuel with each restart. Hope to see this problem rectified soon, otherwise it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.",
        "I enjoy playing the game. I gave you 2 stars because of one thing: the fuels are gone after I open my data connection even though it just got 5/5. Can domebody please tell me where did the fuels go.."

All the \"good reviews\" are from cringey 9 year olds or their parents. Nick has never been good with game. ESPECIALLY in this dark age. Parents go get your kids shooty skies. Not this hunk of garbage. Also (my opinion)  Cartoon network is much better than Nick.",

        "It is so amazing i love this game and have had 3 accouts before on it. on my ipad but now i have it on my laptop. I have allways loved it and allways will.    Update suggetion: can you please add  more lvls and every time you go up a lvl you get the same stuff but can unlock more of the game but you can diside what you can ulock as i think this will make it much more funnier.  can you also make the game better by letting ipad users join laptop users in clans as i have wwr on my ipad and laptop but on my ipad i cant join my clan that is on my laptop and its unfair so please can you add this in too. I think it will make the game much better thank you   PLEASE READ!!!!!",
        "I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points",
        "They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It's definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you'll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.",
        "Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don't be fooled. This is a pay to win game.",
        "I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that's cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!",
        "Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better."

Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying \"Ready? Let's go!\" voice when the sound is on.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",

        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",

It may have adds but they are expected in a free to play mobile app. The adds are easily controlled and aren't annoying at all as they can be easily closed and come in moderation. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are cool and it's very fun and addicting. Perfect to pass time. The developers done a great job, hope for me great games made big these guys.",

However, after the first ten levels it becomes an infuriating cacophony of balancing your bridge on rocks and mountains without anchor points and hanging your bridge from hot air balloons. Levels become so frustratingly impossible that you are forced to watch the videos for hints to get enough stars to progress.",

        "I really like this game . It is awsome. I always play this game when I have to cool down and sometime don't  want to do something. Great time killer. The thing that I like the most in this game is that , there are more than 100 levels and that if free of cost. What amazing and challenging game. But there is something that I really don't like  andbi want to warn you while you are downloading this game. The thing is that whenever you had completed a level an advert comes always. And that is really very annoyed for me. Well all over I want to say that it's  a really very good game and I am very gald that I am on 22nd level and soon I will be in in 23rd.",
        "Ok but I'm on level 9 and 8x8 and I just started it yesterday so yes pretty easy. Oh and by the way if u were going to get it just to warn u there's soooooo many adverts when u complete a level (very annoying)☺☺☺😑😑😑🐜🐜🐜Antnoing u get it hahaha!!!🐜🐜🐜",
        "Totally addicted!  This game goes from basic kg tic tac toe to 6 in a row and challenging the higher level u go over 100 levels so worth it!  And Free!!!",
        "Gr8 Time killer... I Play this classic wonderful game whenever its time to wind down & Cool down after a long day lovin it.👍2 Thumps UP👍 For the Multiplayer mode. You guys did a gr8 job.",

        "Great game i like the multiplayer thing and i also like the ranking or the leaderboard what i dont like the most are the ads too many of them but i know you vcant remove them cause u need to earn money but please limit the ads just let the ads show when the player loses Great Game"

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.",
        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I'm going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable."

        "Starting to get more adds popping up on my screen. And the game keeps bothering me to upgrade the \"midas tap.\" Ain't wasting any more gems on it anymore.",
        "I've spent little over a thousand diamonds for golden tickets. I used those tickets to upgrade my game. But now it's all gone. I had one business on platinum, but it's not there anymore. It disappeared after I reset for the bizbot upgrade. What's the point of spending so many resources when it's going to disappear later? One star rating and uninstalling. This ridiculous.",
        "It's a great and addictive game, only downside is that there's just way too many unnecessary ads!  Like I need to watch an ad for a fortune soon, but as soon as I watched it it won't let me spin until I've watch another and another. Very frustrating.",
        "This game is great, but when i go back on it after being off it for a bit usually when I select anything It will freeze and I'll have to restart and it will work again.

        "This is that type of game where you can either be paitent or rush it by wasting ur time. I have played the game by just opening it and letting the box fill up at 3,000 coins every hr and 20 mins. In the past 2 days i am currently at 30k coins. The game advertisement is false. Unless it has not updated for me yet. If you are just here to look at ads every time you like to get at most 300 coins or even 20. Then this is your game. It has no upgrade system unless, you are willing to pay actual cash for it. Which it is stupid. A $5 gift card is 4,500,000 coins. It might take you at least about 2 weeks to maybe get that. Good luck folks.",
        "At the rate you get coins it would take youbabreally long time for you to redeem for five dollars, but the ads are not very intrusive, and the game works.  If I can get an extra 5. Bucks by the end of the month, I'm happy.",
        "The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don't waste your time",
        "I like the mini games, but I don't like the small amount of money you get by the rate it goes it will take a good year before you can redeem anything. Also, there are too many ads. Other than those things the game itself and the graphics aren't bad😀.",
        "Nice game it's nice to make a bit of money. But.. there are just to many ads. I do not have a nice and normal experience while using the app. If you can lower the ads it will be a good app. I uninstalled because the ads where way to annoying. Please lower the amount of ads. Thanks"

        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn't always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing",
        "The best game on market right now. No ads, unless you request it for coins,(which I doubt you'll need to), many modes, including HELL(Infinite waves), MAP(To gain access to abilities and magic) and BATTLE(Normal wave advancement with bosses every 5 levels.). By far the best game that advertises it is not pay to play. Because it's not, despite the option to buy coins.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer."

        "Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life's to where you can't even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.",
        "I hate the fact that one can't enjoy the game. So many advertising ads keep popping up one right after the other. Interrupting you while your playing the game. It's so annoying & fusterating. The game itself is Awesome but with all these stupid ads in the way. One gets feedup.",
        "Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw \"pick 2\" vs. pick 3. I'm a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the \"typical pick 3 concept\"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper",
        "There are way too many ads, it's pretty much unpleasant and unplayable this way. Banners, full screen ad - 1 min gameplay with banner - again a full screen ad, click play next level and guess what? Yet another full screen ad! Terrible",
        "Not a clue if there's a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It's challenging but I've yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though \"buying lives\""

I would like for all my WoO data to get sent from developers copy if possible. I got a buch of screenshots to back up what I'm saying, and all my google receipts from all the purchases I did.",

Been playing for months now, still love it, definately not a play to win if you get into a good alliance",

        "This game is ok. The graphics are good. It's my favourite bowling game out there.  However I really don't know why this needs access to my phone contacts and other permissions.  As a result it's been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it's not required I'm not installing it. Other than that complaint it's actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.",
        "I have this game on my note, iPad, and computer so it definitely should let you home much I love it.  Not including its wonderful to have when I'm always at the Dr. for hours.",
        "I like this game very much. You dont quite get the amount of exercise as reality provides, however it is something to be overlooked. The method of saving game scores leaves MUCH to be desired, as well as changing and editing profile photos. Notice my photo is (was) displayed 90° out of vertical. So I give the game 4 out of 5 stars in hopes of encouraging the edit functions to be reworked and made more user friendly.",
        "So much fun to play! I am not a very good bowler in real life, but I love bowling so this game allows me to be a much better bowler.",
        "I just installed it and played one game. Seems simple and entertaining but it's WAY too soon to give a fair rating. It's annoying when games are begging you for ratings  before you can even have a chance to explore the game.",
        "Needs to have better controls. Sensitivity to the roll, angles to throw while using curves. Maybe a power gauge for the roll, & moving your stylus or finger while giving it a curving flight on it's way down to the pins"

I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "This is an idle game with effort and pretty fun writing, with a lot of ways to feel rewarded without cracking your wallet. It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like.",
        "For a game so heavily reliant on ads to deliver benefits to the player, it is a gamble sometimes whether or not those ads will crash the game and therefore cost you the prizes. The game itself is all right, but this gamble drags down the experience when it doesn't work.",
        "It's like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. 👌👍❤",
        "Outstanding game. My only fuss is cars get trapped in some buildings during attempts to retrieve funds. Going back to another stage and returning to the stage I'm engaged in usually resets game play. Otherwise, great game."

It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",

For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "There are too many ads it's a game to enjoy the advertisements  I think . But while playing it's good but after we do a single there is a ad and then we do the second nail there is another ad . Please fix this Budge Studios . But no like this game and it is a four star because there are too many ads and also we can't create our own design adding stickers as we can do in match this side",

YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.",
        "The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I'm getting a network error and I'm not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted."

        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!",
        "I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?",
        "Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!",
        "BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..",
        "I love this game.  It's very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.",
        "Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don't track. At least my checkpoints save."

        "I'm really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don't have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!",
        "To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I'd like. You can't at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I'd like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn't taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it's worth the $1.99 purchase I made.",
        "This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don't really care either way I'll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I'd debating on installing it just get it. You'll have fun, trust me.",
        "It's basically Sonic Dash PVP mode. But that doesn't change the fact it's fun. Love the steady support of adding new characters and how every character feels unique despite everyone playing the same (sounds weird but you'll understand after you play it) my only gripe is that when I want to play I have to start the app, close it, then restart again otherwise it never loads",
        "A fun premise ruined by a horrendous match making system,  ridiculous  unlocking time gates, and obvious pay to win incentives.  You'll be constantly matched with players with levels far higher than your own and the rewards are minimal for the all the effort.  The constant ads that play after every match is beyond irritating.",
        "Love the game, but there's something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!"

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "excellent game & one of the best minesweeper apps on the market EXCEPT there's no zoom in feature! makes it impossible to play harder modes on a phone cuz you keep accidentally tapping mines when you're trying to clear the spot next to it :("

I do understand that the game is free and all and I want the game to have ads to support the game, but this game has the most ads of any other game I know, so please atleast have a limit to the ads shown a day or have it shown every 2 games.

        "You have hackers playing this game. I just played a game against a guy who ballons kept passing all his towers but no points came out of his health. I rember why I delted this game in first place. I could have a ton of gallons go thru people's line and they not lose health.",

It would be nice to have modes where there are the fun modifiers but medalions aren't on the line.",

Was 5 star, but now only 3-4 to the update that failed me.     Edit: I deleted the app and reinstalled it and now it is finally working again!"

        "I know this will get lost in the review section... But this game is amazing! I work with special needs children and they accomplish advanced skills just for the reward of playing this game! The animations, the graphics, the game play is beautiful. Following the bananas is easy enough for some of the kiddos, while some just like to watch me play. Either way, this game is helping children accomplish goals, is a great time passed for me, and while in app purchases are cool, they are certainly not necessary! A+ :)",
        "Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won't do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.",
        "I have a Xiaomi Redmi 4 mobile with 3 GB RAM, 1.4 GHz Octa Core. Still Game hangs, Speed enhanced with a jerk every time and then it dies. I have reset my mobile and reinstalled it but the problem still there. It's very annoying. Otherwise I love this game. It's very addictive.",
        "Love this game ..I am been hooked with this game since years .however wanted to highlight I am currently in Level 346 Residential area where the task is to use slides 5 times to go to next level. However I have played that level so many times and found that Residential area doesn't have slides ...is this a bug ? How do we overcome it",
        "The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I've reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn't sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall",
        "I like this game but there's so much cheating going on. It doesn't resister some of the moves you make or it's lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can't see what's coming next. Just stop cheating! Don't take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab."

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that's not fair....",
        "Found a game called \"Infinite Balls\" on my friend's iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it's not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.",

        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want",
        "This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I'm very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.",
        "The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i'm playing.. Anyway, it's addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you're not playing",
        "First off, I'd like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It's amazing.  However, I've been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can't pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs."

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",

I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D",
        "I absolutely love the game,  but I have one question. ...why is it called \"talking hank\"? Hank doesn't say a freaking word!!! I realize that it's a spin off of \"talking tom\", it's just an observation and is a little annoying. .. otherwise GREAT, GREAT GAME."

        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you",
        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!"

Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I've ever played",

I already know that Gameloft will give best graphical experience ever but the game is frikkin good .but the recent update have a slight problem. It is the details of objects takes time to form fully. But the race is done before it . Please fix this problem.",
        "You virtually have to buy them blue tokens. Not enough gold being handed out. But it gets worse, this was once a top flight game, now I wanna delete forever and never return. It Still Crashes. And None of the luxury cars, go way, way too fast and you'll never actually win either a challenge or actually race. This game is totally horrible now.",
        "You have to change the controls to tap left and right to turn. And change the sensitivity to 100%. Once that is done th controls are good.   Good game, it would have been nice to be able to play against your friends over the internet also, not just wi fi. It needs rewards in local wi fi also.. S class class cars turn with 1 second delay, which is very frustrating",

        "If you've liked the first game you're probably gonna enjoy this one. It's more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it's built around microtransactions so if you're feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don't understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it's likely you're going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.",
        "Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren't aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don't expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!",
        "Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I'm done, and become impossible. I'd love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It's a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it's a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.",
        "For almost 2 years that I haven't been able to play PvZ2, just when I'm about to go and check on my account and play again, I noticed that my progress was lost. I tried to relogin a couple of times, and still I can't relogin with my old progress. My almost 3 years of playing and grinding, all lost. And without a clue of what happened. Please resolve this problem if you value old players like me. And if you think that I didn't saved it through my google acc. You're wrong, I have proof in my google play achievements that I have been playing this game for a long time.",
        "I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks",
        "I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017."

        "I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "Too many ads. It's annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying \"Something went wrong, please try again later\" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it's a super addictive and fun game to play.",
        "This game needs a lot of work done. So many glitches its really weird and hard to explain the glitches that happen. One of them was the screen uncalibrated itself an it was moved to the upper left side , an the right side was just black . idek if that makes sense but it shouldn't happen.",
        "The game is amazing, but it is pathetic at the fact that there are ads popping up every 2 minutes and there's no way to remove them... I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won't be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them.",
        "I'd happily purchase this game but that doesn't seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I'll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!"

I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",
        "I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you'll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha",

You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.",

So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5",

Also the high-end cars are just the low end ones, wide bodied into smithereens, but the developers didn't bother to bring the wheels out to the fenders.

        "The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn't cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can't pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game",
        "Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.",
        "I used to enjoy this game when I had a minute spare. I was cruising at around level 300 enjoy the simplicity of it but not anymore! Since the introduction of the \"ice\" balls, it's become near impossible. Reading the other comment I'm glad to see that others are frustrated with the aim moving right at the last minute. I had this at 5 stars now it's 1.",
        "It is a good game but is built to take $$.  There are some levels that will not let you pass without spending $$ which I refuse to do.   I understand the need to make $$, but when it is blatantly built to take money, that is where I have an issue.  I wish I could upload the video of the level this takes place in, then you would understand what I mean. Decent game but sad for the obvious reason for the game.",
        "Best goddamn game I've ever played, most amazing graphics in the entire gaming world! I'm thinking of naming my next kid Power Pop. I didn't believe in God until I discovered this life changing game.",
        "Good for killing a bit of time.  Too many adverts and the sequence of colours appearing make levels impossible without playing lots of times. Used all the gained coins buying 20 extra balls for 1 level and still only had balls of a colour I couldn't hit... Ice balls make current level close to impossible. Just swapping where ice is without removing anything dozens of tries and not got even close to finishing."

        "This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.",
        "Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn't take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I'm wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don't know some of the logos what is the point of the game.",
        "Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.",
        "Great game. Simple and fun. Some awesomely hard ones and some I didn't know I knew. Especially like the achievement and leaderboard. A way to save progress would be good as I've reset my phone a few times and lost progress.",
        "Several times now I've tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn't see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",
        "It's too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I'd like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches."

        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "There should be a full match game like this that isn't scripted. I love it! Should be an energy free mode maybe? As its a bit pay to win\\microtransaction heavy.  They've made some changes, if you like ads and Facebook popping up after everything you do, then this is the game for you, dropped my rating 1 star as a result.  Also took out the ability to watch adverts for in game currency, now you have to pay. Even more of a cash grab now.",
        "The defensive players are always faster to the ball than the offense. If you mess up during a game you have to go all the way back (unless u pay money for their in game credit). Half the time it sets you up with a shot that there is now way you can score or pass successfully."

        "Brilliant, innovative, addictive game BUT please reduce the number of ads. That's why this game is only averaging  3.5* and why I can only give it 4*. People will stop playing very quickly as it currently is. Just take it down to an ad break every end of run. Also a way to easily view all positions on the leader board would be nice. Otherwise the game itself is great.",
        "I would have bought the ad free Version eventually, but it was so annoying even to get used to the game, that I gave up. If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "It's a great game, for users complaining about ads, it's called ad blocker. When devs force a billion ads and make it unplayable, I use adaway, game is great after, but without adaway, don't bother!",
        "Game is good. Ads are bloody appalling. I have to waste 30 seconds each time I die? No thank you",
        "Alright if you like ads more than gameplay. Stuck with 30 second ads after 20 secs of play. Don't mind some ads, but this is overkill. Pass.",
        "Edit: Ruined it because if the ads. I understand why you have them, but I was willing to watch them IF I felt like doing another round or not. Having the choice to watch one or not was nice. Now you're just forced to after death. Sorry, that's never a good idea. And no, save your copy pasted response, I don't want it. It's not genuine, and it's just a plead for us to buy the ad removal thing.  Original: The core gameplay loop is cool. It's fun, I'll keep booting it up. But it would benefit greatly by a better tutorial. As someone else said before, the ball tends to fly off and lose momentum in ways I can't seem to figure out. Might be a failing on my part, but at times it feels like gravity changes the rules at random and I'm left floating hopelessly as the void swallows me up. I'm not really sure what the optimal way to survive is"

Major daily after last update nearly useless as well. On lvl70 (2 months) got only 1 5* bird so forget about high star team. Uninstalled.",

The only frustrating event is the daily Eagle Mountain event which may have more to do with my expectations than game design.",

        "Players are bailing from this game like crazy. My clan has lost nearly all the higher level players, most from leaving the game. So the clan is all low level players who can't contribute as much. Arena player's list shows everyone but the top 3 not playing all week. A ton of other issues that you can find in any ABE forum and even in the comments on posts on the ABE Facebook page. I think Rovio's stock trend shows it all.",

I wish I can change the view of the battle, so if I want to use some tricky shots, my finger won't block the view. Some birds are (almost) impossible to get, I spend many premium tickets only to get two stars bird. Must use the internet to play. Heavy use of power, battery powers are drained...fast. Simply not enough gems aquired through normal playing, and the game simply an overwhelming use of it. Insane mode is really impossible to beat without dying once or twice.",
        "OK. So, it started off fun. But, now all I get is lost connection, slow connection or some other BS! I'm not going to be able to get any further because I won't pay for stuff. So, it's going to be uninstalled. Of you must, play for a week, then ditch it"

        "Absolutely amazing game, and the ads don't lie either! Gameplay is just what you asked for, and grinding isn't horrible, just have a few issues. First why do we have to download the game every update. If your going to do that, at least allow people to play 1day without requiring the update because not everyone wants to have 370mb of updates on mobile data. Second the game is a little heavy on p2w and gold is a little hard to earn, but it's earnable. Also a tip to new players upgrade armor before anything else",
        "The game sucks! No matter how much you upgrade their is always someone else that can kill you with one shot! Get this fixed and I might start playing again. Nice to see all the updates y'all do is to put better odds in favor of people who spend a lot of money!",
        "been playing for quite some time now with multiple accounts. especially lvl34+ it's important to be able to chat with other players to team up! it sux not be able to chat. please introduce at least messages to friends.. btw, update is brilliant, fps highest I've ever seen in a game, ever..",
        "Just an overall fantastic game It's hard for me to play same game for more than a month but this just makes me come back to play it. I haven't uninstalled the game a single time and that's a complement The offense in the game is great, but would love to see some defensive capabilities like shield and such",
        "Ok first of all please fix the matchups because I just had a 1v4 match which of course I get totally destroyed. Second in every match I play a guy either has a lvl 4 Thanatos or lvl4 jack Frost. While these people get easy wins the rest of us have a huge time leveling up.",
        "This game is the best rated FPS in mobile. However there are a lot off issues with lag spikes', and I hate how people with more levels have more health. This isn't clash royale guys! And please add a jump. We would love that. Thanks"

        "To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.",
        "Used to be so much better. Cameras are now not fluid, it doesn't show the hole prior to shot anymore. Truthfully, it was awesome before you made changes... It goes back to the old saying, \"why fix it if it isn't broken?\"",
        "Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn't as fun and realistic as I had hoped.",
        "It's bad because it's bad and if the developer emails me again I'm going to sue him. So don't test me",
        "Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I've been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!",
        "This game is good. You should try to make it a lot more like golf with friends (the Steam game). Try to make the graphics look more detailed and better. Add more maps too."

The levels are easy and somewhat boring, which is unfortunate because Geometry Dash is usually neither of those things.",

        "Simple to learn, fun to master.  New upgrades and speed of the bikes, and while you can buy things in game, i dont feel pressured into it.  It does have a few adds (chunks of 5 seconds, not bad) and the classic 30 second option add to double coins won (which i do, over a certain price lol)  overfall fun and great game to play when bored",
        "Are u like seriously stupid or think we are stipid? Sometimes it doesn't give space to move bike forward and the 2nd thing is if we move a little to the end of the road it shows crashed crashed u stupid !!!",
        "Fun time killer.... and falling off the cycle and slamming face first into the pavement without waking up in a bodycast is funny!",
        "Awful game, too many ads, too many in-app purchases flying in front of your face all the time. Controls are almost absent. Multiplayer is obviously a fake",
        "1. To much ads 2. Cool game 3. Make a game mode for playing local and game codes to play in a room with friends but other wise it  is really fun and challenging good on you guys for making this game"

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "I really like the game I play it every single day and im not that much of a gamer. Im actaully at level 82 and cannot go further cause im waiting for more missions. Lol So please send more missions.😁 plus i love the sarcasm between the two of them😂keep it up!",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "I would have rated this game 5 stars but for the fact that I'm at level 82 and it says more missions coming soon... Who does that? This is the best game I've played in a while so it was a bummer when I saw the message. Explain why this is so or just fix it already. I have no issues with the game itself - control, graphics etc, but this pause is driving me crazy. There's no game without a mission. It defeats the purpose."

        "I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",
        "I love this app! It's sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it's a fantastic app!",
        "It's a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it's really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars",
        "I don't think it's the best game... but it's something but..when I colour it it just fills up the hole page. So yeah I don't really like it that much and I deleted it when I wrote this so... not a good game but ok",
        "I personally love this game but I would wish that maby u could make it a little bit easier to draw on this game and other wise this is an amaizing game and I recommend installing this game. Like this if u agree. 😆😇."

        "Love the app. Great time killer. Certain times of the day when playing I notice a change of cards I get dealt usually the after noon I start losing every hand forcing me to get off. I have a straight the next person always has a higher hand. Seems suspicious. I know u can't win all the time but still. Also private tables where only friends/poker buddy's can join would be a definite plus to add to the game. As some of the randoms just f around and bet all in from the start.",
        "For a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with no options for using one's social media profile pic. To that end frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a good game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes.",
        "I recommend not to install. You can get banned anytime even without a warning or any explanation, and when u contact support you will get auto response. Bad customer support. I got banned a second after reporting two cheaters or bots idk and they took my 12 billions.",
        "It's totally pay to play. It puts you on a fast table with higher stakes to start. You burn through your initial free chips in five minutes, then you have to either wait half a day or buy more. Well I'm not waiting 4 hours just to play cards, and I'm sure as hell not spending money when it goes so fast. Not fun at all.",
        "Hands dont seem to be computer greedy to take your chips. Nor give higher level players generated wins with getting obvious flop or river cards giving them a win on a ridiculous hand they go all in on.",
        "Cards are not random at all. No one gets that many flushes in one game. Please apply a new patch to fix your issues!!! Also three people in one hand should not have K-10 with K-10 on the table!! Improbable, if it ever happened in real life id think the sky was falling. Other wise an ok game but the games are in a pattern and easily predictable. Please fix!!!"

        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Okay, the torpedo issue is a bit better now, we can enjoy this game more. But DD is still OP. Anyway, your next homework is how the ship move. We talk about another player ship that play with us not ship that we drive. Their move is rather like a truck than a ship.  They have to move like our ship,  the stern drift first, right.",
        "Great game! Love to play it. Had 1 problem so far. Was playing a battle ship. Was rammed by a destroyer... Had all my guns on him. His ship went OVER mine which meant all my guns were now facing the wrong way. He on the other hand torp'd me to death....",
        "The game is a joke, cuz 1. the time is too short, 2. Maps are tiny, we meet enemies face to face 3. Nothing like the pc version 4. Needs all the ships got on pc version 5. ship turning is picullier to physics. 6. Low exp reward. Much lower.",
        "Good game, perfect for long term play both at home and work. Only complaint is torpedoes are over powered and hit box too large. That's why I give it 3 stars",
        "Very good engaging gameplay. I think destroyers are a bit op. Maybe battleships and cruisers should have aim assistant like destroyers have... Because sometimes it really painful to lose against one pesky destroyer :) or maybe limit them like 2-3 per battle or something. When you see 4 or 5 of them and you are in a battleship then it's no fun :) other than that it's a great game."

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",
        "Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",
        "Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "Good concept but a lot of the puzzles are stupid or they totally don't work unless you restart the game which is annoying. There's so many glitches I felt like uninstalling so many times! I'm just glad it's over so i can get rid of this app. 3/10 wouldn't recommend",
        "Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I'm at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.",
        "I play this game in 2hrs and got stuck on level 42. It's challenge your mind. It's good for you, if you like doing brain games.. It helps you think about.. Like you really have to think about it or you will get stuck. But all the above, it's a awesome awesome game."

        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "Update: so I've been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They're twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you're unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "I don't know what the game is even like. I couldn't even get past the loading part because it won't let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won't play this game any further as its a waste of your time.",
        "The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it"

Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don't work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!",
        "I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don't work right and they glitch out. I've been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can't complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed",
        "Very disappointed that I've had no response to my email and that there is no sign of a fix to the bug with El Porkado, rendering the levels uncompletable. Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have some of my actual money!",
        "level 18 in the road to El porkado (sorry if I spelled it wrong) is impossible because the grey platforms are out of place, even if I use the engineer pig I still can't get past it. also when I level up the bar goes back down again a tiny bit and I have to get more exp. the rest of the game works fine but please fix the bugs. anyway are you even listening to the other people, because I saw a lot of them complaining about the bugs. because of this you get 3 stars from me",
        "The game is really good but the bridge bug is annoying. I got stuck on a level and tried to reinstall the app but it did not work. It is so annoying that a really good game like this has a bug that prevents you from finishing the game. Oh and also, what is different about the HD version? It seems to be the exacted same.",
        "Generally great, but destroyed by graphics/world modeling glitches that render levels impossible to complete! Generally involving trap doors that aren't in the right place. Frustrating. AND the new cake race won't unlock rewards- 24000 hrs to go apparently so I can't play more levels."

        "Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.",
        "Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.",

They always happened at the beginning and I hate it. I don't think you should not install it its not fun.",
        "This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!"

        "SO HAPPY!😀😀😀😀😀😀 This is really fun! It is really magical. I love disney ever since I saw this game. Just it lags when we collect rewards and it kicks me off. Rather than that it is perfect! Great game, I need more games like this! Why do companies  do not make more games like this ?! I had been playing since the second month it came out! So 2 years. Who cares about money I do not use my real money and I am progressing a lot! Maybe it is some phones and tablets. When I do not need the characters I put them in long missions and get a bunch of magic. SO HAPPY!",
        "Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I'm not proud of what I'm about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a \"Russian Roulette\" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It's like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you're money concisious don't download this game. I've played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you're a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.",
        "I really love this game. My only complaint is when they have special release items every 2 hours or every 4 hours. They release 24 hours a day, so if you want to rank high on the leaderboard you have to wake up multiple times a night to play! I'm sleep deprived!",
        "OK I love this game, however have a problem, I recently broke my phone had to send it of to get fixed. Have uploaded this game to my iPad have clicked it over to the correct game to keep my level however gets right to the loading section then kicks me out. My iPad is up to date, can you please fix this bug. I haven't played for a few games, the tempary phone I have won't let me play either. Please fix..",
        "I've given it 5 stars but really it would be 4.5 stars. The prices of things in this game are stupidly high and they don't make it easy for you to get money and gems. It will take you months just to save up to expand one square in the kingdom.",
        "I've been playing this game off and on for a little over 1 year. I'm absolutely in love with this game. The loading does take forever, and I've been having problems since I updated the game (unless it's just my phone) but I refuse to get rid of it! It's time consuming when need be, and no matter how many days I do not play I never lose my place. Two thumbs up!"

        "My absolute all time favorite game! I used to have the woodblock version and would play that one ALL the time. The only thing I didn't like about it was that I couldn't get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It's got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don't feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it's a good way to get your mind working if you're someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^",

        "Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however."

There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",
        "This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would've given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the \"!!\" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game",
        "Finally! For the the longest time I've been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn't look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.",
        "Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it's so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",
        "Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you'll have.",
        "I've had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that's enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun."

When I started thinking that I need to start again in my piano career, I started looking for piano apps that I could play my own music. Unfortunately, a lot of the apps didn't work for me until I came across this one. Just to say thanks for making this great app. :)",
        "This app is so good! I've never had a piano and wanted to learn but couldn't but I started writing my own songs on this app and it's so good. The graphics are like a real piano and I love the magic tiles and everything about this app!!! ❤❤❤",
        "This, after 6 years of playing piano has narrowed all my work down to half the size.. I've been a musical genius, and then tragedy struck, and I lost my ability completely half my life... wasted. But this app helped me to relearn how to play. Thank you. Thank you immensely",

        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get.😊",
        "Homelands bens the hotel. I LOVE you ma so cute when we get a m l. I am not a cat I don't like it please give you a child and it was weird but they were all in all in one is my friend who has the best chance for you are mean that song free download share the normal way. my puppy and he like to join us in Philippines and the murderer to buy it please don't have the same problem. Hi I have to m, good for me. Goodnight my name in one of ugly, uu",
        "You know what? I was a long time gamer of this game. I breed a lot of dragons but eventually, all dragons that I hatched and feed are all gone. I don't know where it go but I know myself that I didn't sell any dragons unless I alrrady have that kind of dragon but then the pattern and patience of waiting an egg to hatch become a waste. Sad for my dear city.",
        "I like it overall, but recently random ads pop up out of nowhere.  This is quite annoying, especially when you are about to do something.  You also cannot immediately skip these ads if you wish to do so.  There is a fast forward icon for some, but only after a certain amount of time.",
        "Have been playing for a while now, great time passer. Do find it frustrating when getting orbs or dragons as prizes the you get continually get the same orbs. If gotten enough orbs to summon the same dragon 3 times while getting very few  other orbs. Or you get really close to the required number and that orb stops appearing. Hard not to spend money to save time.",
        "Don't waste your time with this game. It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don't give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don't waste your time with this game."

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",

        "Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it's class.",
        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "They could tweak a few things such as being able to pack items as you reach necessary amount when increasing storage capacity. Considering I'm at the point I need 19 of each item (and yet it still only increases by 5) it takes up way too much space. Certain items take way too much time to produce and practically impossible to find in the trade depot. Aside from those and a few other things, I really enjoy this game.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I've made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new \"club wars\" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There's always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don't have to spend real money to play the game, but I'll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I've even started a second city on another device with my other email.",
        "The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :("

        "It was a good game, until new update. The car body now go to scrap and not in the selling list, thus reduced the profit earning. Also in buildings needs to be repaired, materiap required is of huge quantity. Graphics needs to be better. Game play is easier to understand. Also in bank no complete cash statement is available, like complete diamond spend statement is available and not cash one.  Will surely give 5 star after fixing above points",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "Game is simple and easy to play but the materials are hard to get and even when have enough to repair a building it's not working. Also the rewards to leveling up are very low for the amount of work needed to get there. After about level 11 or 12 is just more experience but the same $100 and 10 energy cap increase. No diamonds and no material for leveling up. Fix these few issues and I'm sure this game will keep it's fun factor a little longer",
        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly"

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Dont expect any support for this game. I've been locked out and i am still waiting on a resolution, like many here. I've paid money and i know i wont be getting any compensation let alone how long its going to take to fix it.",
        "One of the few games that I don't mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card's artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer.",
        "My big complain is that I cannot enable notifications, I'm on a pixel phone and it is no where to be found in the settings menu, I just uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it shows up. It's really inconvenient as a guild leader to not be able to get notifications. Thank you"

There are some flaws, mainly in the fact that there are only a few maps so more maps would be nice. Also, it would be nice if you could change the name or if there is a way, tell me. There are other slightly bad things but overall a great game.",
        "Great concept the only thing wrong with it is the slow movement's that happens some Times during the game hope  that you all fix it. Another thing is the lack of stages there are only four to three stages and all of them are with ice add more and I guarantee your that your ratings is going to rise. Finally the option to change your name at the main screen and better control's than just jumping. Would love to play it once these issues are fixed and I don't mean to be harsh hope you all got my opinions",
        "The graphics are perfect for the style, but attacks should be more under your contract with weapons, and variation without. I also can't find the Bluetooth multiplayer hinted by the Bluetooth connection permissions. Is that a later feature? If so please add soon!"

        "There's absolutely no way you're able to go through all the levels unless you spend money at some point or you just wait out the lives recount. It's a good freemium game, but don't bother redoing levels unless it's to earn more coins for essential upgrades. This game WILL take your money if you let it.",
        "I love the game but .... once hit level 46... seems impossible even with boosts ... I want a game that's NOT trying to get you hooked then have to pay money to get you  to the next level just to play ...up to the 46th level (playing each level 3 times..and having all time consuming upgrades) was very entertaining and awesome... but after 46th level...once again seems impossible... hope I can get 15 thumbs up... one day... or I'll just delete..np",
        "This game is soooo fun!! Its better than Cooking Fever. I love this game!❤ the levels get harder but that's the fun of it. And the food makes me really hungry🍔! But the thing is that after a few days (when i first got the game) it didn't let me play the game, it just stayed at 89 percent. So I got the game again but it still did it😭.",
        "Great cooking game! I love that all of the upgrades so far have been based on the money I earned and not the premium currency. With hundreds of levels to play, it'll take some time to have to wait for more.   My only issue is I have a ton of money in one city and can't transfer it to another.",
        "I want an explanation for not being able to win the gold ticket in level 100 in Rome. I have spent 3 bosters on it and is impossible to go trough no matter if i make 1000 or 3000 coins i wont win the gold ticket and i cant go forward because of it. You need to tell the players whats the criteria to win this tickets because it changes all the time. I have played several levels numerous times and it feels like you give the ticket whenever you feel like. 22 likes 22 customers and sometimes you have to play the same level 5 or 6 times doesnt seem right. Level 100 in Rome asked for 1500 coins i played got way more than that no gold ticket play second time and changes to 1650 i play again and no gold ticket go and play again and it is 1800 coins.  IMFORM YOUR PLAYERS OF THE CRITERIA TO WIN GOLD TICKETS.",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again."

It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Please reduce the cost of things on store and do something in your next update so that the player can get more and more diamonds from the hit list. Please reduce the cost of jet pack.  And when I watch videos for reward, it doesn't work. I have watched over a hundred videos but it's only two times that I got a reward.",
        "Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update."

        "the human opponents and the nice community are the only points to install this, but in this regard, those are damn wide ranged and very useful.  too bad, analysis isn't free and the trainer sucks. oh well, played here for HUMANS.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on.."

The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate [150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is \"strictly Russian\" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)]!

Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I'm going through please fix the game up a bit 😄",

        "So It's a good game and all but after I reached 1687 fans my coach keeps saying after each round \"let's make me the best skater ever!\" Shouldn't it be changing up? And also should it be me saying that instead of the coach??"

        "Good game however, once you've taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world's and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.",
        "Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.",
        "It's a really great game! I'm really looking forward to an update. I think it'd be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I'm looking forward to see what you guys do!",
        "This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.",
        "please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there's not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.",
        "One of me and my sister's favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don't  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are great😁"

        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed.",
        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you've collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic."

This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",

Need to have a section that explains how some of these games are played and the rules.",

Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done.",
        "Worst poker app there is. As soon as you make money it makes you lose no matter your hand. Probably bots. Only bad whole cards win. Play if you want but DO NOT SPEND A CENT ON THIS APP. It's fixed. Che k out you tube for proof. Then the send garbage email to say it's not fixed. Sent to every bad review. Please play a different app anyone.",
        "Worst Poker Game Ever, AI Scripted for Purchasing Players, So who ever spends the most wins the most, Typical pyramid Playtika Platform, Almost all Google Games setup this way, There not even games, wish someone would hack the whole system of corruption. F your Econgra pay under the table BS reply, you know I'm right.",
        "They don't prey on data mining your phone. First review I was livid about odds not feeling right, I was a baaad player. WSOP is the best coded poker game. It buffers well for each person's delay. Best real play and lots ways for easy chip recovery if you don't want ante up."

        "I have downloaded and uninstalled it and did the same process over again and I still can't play it. It keeps telling me that it needs an active internet connection to play. Well, I can play my other internet based mobile games and I am writing this review from the same mobile device and everything else that requires internet is working so it is a fault in the game itself. It's a shame because I really wanted to play this but now I am going to uninstall it and not bother with it again because it is frustrating me. If the issue gets fixed somehow then I may think about playing it.",
        "So I'm changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it's a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I'd rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!",
        "GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they're pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must 'assemble' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus 'dice'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.",
        "This game is fun but I don't know if it's a bug or they're doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there's no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I'm about to uninstall this game.",
        "This game cheats! Don't get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn't for you. But if you don't care that much, like me, it's absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don't be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!",
        "I'll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn't be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap."

        "I'm loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don't change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can't go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. I like the breakable rear lights on some of the cars. Maybe add deflatable tires? Very good game all in all",
        "This game is fun and entertaining and you can test drive all the vehicles which make it quite cool. Wish there was a camera view which you could zoom out so you can see from a better angle of all those around you. Reversing auto changes the camera. Some times multiple simultaneous button clicks don't work. And I wish they had one of my favourite cars here, the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento",
        "I had loved this game until it stopped saving my car purchases. Like my last  one the pick up that looks exactly like a 80s chevy with the cap off and roll cage. I put 7.0 motor in it with NOS tires and paint. Went in this morning it was gone. Please fix.Norton also says you're monitoring my location how obtrusive you dushbags.",
        "Kept telling me that I was going the wrong way even though I was going the right way while racing. Which then it puts you in last place. So, I'm uninstalling this game because it's frustrating to be winning a race and a design flaw ruins the game for me. Also, giving more camera angles would be nice for the other players not uninstalling this game like I am right now☠☠☠☠",
        "This game is awsome!  Controls and graphics can be a little laggy,  but the large amount of tracks and cars to unlock and play around with makes up for it. My favorite car is the Duke Wagon Classic, nitro-charged, with a v-8 dropped into it.  Will kick butt in any race or derby! My only suggestion would be on the physics of the cars... Instead of having the bodies simply crush and get smaller/deformed, it would be cool to see body panels and  small pieces like lights and mirrors fall right off. Just a thought. Also it would be cool to have more big station wagon type cars.",
        "Its a very addictive and also a great time killer would like to see a spoiler selection for the cars. My favirote car is fury. I would like to see a (1963 Ferrari 250 gto WITHOUT smoke stacks) the thing i dont like about the game it is not letting me into the city i bought it and i tried over and over again but its not letting me its gliching a lot and exits me out of the game other than that it is a great game would like to see some new buses and trailers for  the semi's out in test trive mode and a new land area in the mountains."

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",

Contact me as soon as possible.",

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",

The \"x\" button on the ads is not in the right position, so tapping it doesn't close the ad and you have to hunt for the hidden close button.

        "To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn't.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don't let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that's why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That's not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.",
        "Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don't like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.",
        "You know this is the best chess app. The magnus tuned engines works great. You actually improve with each passing day. Few points too. I would have given it 100 stars if possible if the graphic would have been better. The graphic you know, like black and white makes a very depressing combination. Also an option for online game with others would make it a perfect app.",
        "Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.",
        "This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...😁",
        "Love the idea behind it. Well executed and a really fun feel to the game. Wish there was a 3d board option- have always found flat 2d chess board graphics frustrating to read."

        "Will start with that, the game itself is great for little kids. But is full with ads, which we all know that the developers need it, but they should think also about the kids. 1-2 years kids don't understand how get out of all this ads, which are popping up every 1min!.About the pay version (Ads free). We pay for it, but I would like to see more random popping stuff. For example the category with the animal is like 8 or 12 animal in total. The category with the numbers also is around 8. After all this is just suggestions, no bad meaning. But as parent I would like to see this game even more creative and helping our kids to think also creativity. Good game for kids!",
        "Ads are everywhere in this game. For a 2 year old who doesn't understand  how to exit out of the ad is frustrating. Ya, you have the ad free option for $2.99 but when I searched for \"free apps for 2 year olds\" this shouldn't come up in the search. Apps for toddlers should never have ads in them.",
        "I am absolutely livid!! It's one thing to have ads, hey it's a free app that needs to be financed somehow...what's unacceptable are age inappropriate ads. This app should be pulled. The very first ad was that of a match game matching deal people. My son is 18months old. Thanks app is rated 5 and under. My 5 year old should not see deal people as course of play. Pull this app now!!",
        "Such a good game! My 1.5 year old loves it and it was so amazing watching him learn how to put the shapes into the correct places. There's about 9 categories I think so it doesn't ever get boring- you can choose from many different shapes. The only complaint is the ads are getting worse -  it used to be just at the bottom where my son could accidently press it, but now they actually appear overriding the game and you have to watch for 30 sec and can't exit... Hard for a child to understand he has to wait to get back to his game. If it gets any worse my rating will go down.",
        "This app almost hits the mark, but could use a few tweaks to make it better for toddlers. My not-quite-2yo goddaughter gets the concept and likes the idea of matching shapes, but she gets frustrated because when she drags a shape over to its match, unless it is situated *exactly* over it, it won't drop into place. It requires a level of precision and dexterity that I think is a little beyond a 2yo. She then loses interest and backs out of the app. Would it be possible to increase the boundaries of the drop area?",
        "Was at least 4 star,ruined by ads everywhere. I understand there's a way to remove the ads by paying,but they're so frequent and obtrusive it's basically unplayable now:&lt;"

I play it all the time plz don't change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.",
        "Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don't have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!",
        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "This game can be a fun one but it keeps moving slow when I roll over about 5 or more of the yellow arrows and it's distracting. Idk if the game is new but could you review this please. Only one 'kind' of obstacle is there. The black boxes. Otherwise good game. 😊",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time."

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "So far I've been enjoying it. It's nothing too special, typical mobile fighting game but Tekken. The fact that's it Tekken makes it more enjoyable than average because I love Tekken, but that's just me. I feel that acquiring new characters needs to be way easier than it is, especially when you need to take on harder missions for bonus materials and currency. I don't like how you have to wait for characters health to regenerate. If characters healths auto filled per mission, I would definitely put more time into the game. Since it isn't, I have to constantly stop playing and wait for the health to refill, and I don't wait to use healing items because it takes away from my in game currency, which itself is difficult to obtain if you aren't constantly grinding. Aside from that, it's fun. Very fun, I recommend.",
        "This game is beautiful! I have always loved Tekken ever since the 1st and have played them all. I only wish some of my favorite characters weren't missing, like Lei and Bryan and I haven't seen Yoshimitsu or Heihachi Mishima. Overall I am very impressed. Thanks, I have been waiting for this on Android for a long time! I would rate 4.5 stars ☺"

        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!",
        "People are losing alot of money in this. This game no fun no more. And all u say are im sorry to hear....blablabla....it is imposibble to win and when we win some we lose a alot. Huuge dont care about our complain as long they make money. More player hurts, more player lose, they just dont care as long peoples make them income. Very very bad game."

        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.",
        "I play solitaire to look busy in public. My brow furrows a bit so it probably looks important. I have social anxiety. I was informed that a 5* review would let me bypass ads, which are sometimes loud and totally give away the fact that I'm doing something useless."

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

I dont know if anyone else has experienced what my 7yr old son has but on loading the game he was shown a flashing image of a man getting stabbed in the eye. This gqme has been removed and i have reported it to the video standards board that apply ratings on these games. Not sure how these things are even possible?",
        "I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it's very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.",

They know Legos are awesome enough that playing with some digital versions is enough to promote buying the physical bricks. ~~~~ NO ADS - Just Fun! ~~~ Even the adults like this one. It's comparable to minions paradise but with all the waiting and advertising removed.",

        "Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it'll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what's the point of a good game concept, if the game won't work properly",
        "I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I'm gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can't remember now. Oh well...",
        "Quite an enjoyable game and different to games I normally play.  It is a strategy game were you have to try and create a deadly virus and wipe out the world, before the scientists find a cure.  What makes this game different is that instead of trying to save the human race, you try to destroy it.   Just a good job it isn't real.",
        "The game is addictive but when you get to a certain point the cure kicks in and it stops giving away DNA points and it makes it hard to advance in the game. I have read the hints in the news it gives, but I still can't manage to beat the game. I want to delete the game. Butim going to continue to try. I just wanted to mention it idk if its the game or just me. I won't tell others about the game only because its frustrating to play. These games are not good for people to play that has any type of mental issue unless they want to buy a new phone.",
        "Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn't change, the rate of death shouldn't decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise",
        "From beginning to end I've been pleasantly surprised and let down but mainly let down. I was all for this game when it came out but now you wanna make a quick buck on a scenario app... pay more for something that should be part of the game. Overall good game business practices not so much."

I cannot as yet recommend it for absolutes if precision is mandatory for the project at hand, but with very little practice an acceptable +/- of less than 3-5% is dependable. Highly recommend for any instance where time is valuable and close approximations are acceptable. Really a welcome tool for my home projects.",

Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn't provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(",

Matches are freezing while i'm ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i've lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost.

My problem is my trophy points are above 1500 but I always find a enemy with 900 points and it takes more than 1minute to find a enemy please guys tell me what do I do it is so frustrating I can't take it anymore",
        "Overall the game itself is pretty good and worth the download for a good couple hours of fun even with a few friends. However I would highly recommend not spending any money on the in game purchases. I got ripped off, luckily with in game currency only and the \"game team\" is adamant that nothing went wrong. If that is the type of support they give I wouldn't want something to go wrong with my actual money. So long story short as long as u don't spend money u should have a good time playing",

        "Now these days, to be powerful is cards. And it's really sad to see it in one of my favorite fighting game. I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it's still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I'm going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.",
        "The game is a lot of fun but there's one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it's kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I'd give it 10 stars",
        "I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn't too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can't sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?",
        "Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn't going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range",
        "Would be great if there were a better sign in feature. I had to restore factory settings on my phone... Now the game won't allow me to log into my account. Which sucks a lot, I have spent money on microtransactions and a bit of time into leveling up. But now that seems to be all gone...",
        "Poor game poor tech support. Tech supports says they get 1000s of issues everyday and can't support everyone. Then why they have to charge their customers when they can't offer proper support. Moreover they don't even bother to understand what customers are telling and don't know who their payment partner is either. Wonderful Nekki! Continue to serve with superior support in future and provide more reasons like the one you gave to me.. Hats off!"

        "I expected the physics to be as flawless as Turborilla's MX games but they're not at all. Clunky, inconsistent physics leave you shaking your head and trying in vain to sum up what you did differently than the 100 previous attempts.",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it's a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz",
        "Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game",
        "Game is very addicting but after a little while of playing you can't hit jump or land! Maybe just me? Also, I don't want to pay for upgrades. Should be merit based on how well you race.",
        "Disappointing...the game would easily be 5 stars, as it is very fun, but once you reach a certain point, it becomes pay to play as you need gold to upgrade your bike to stay competitive with the CPU rider.  Can't even play anymore because it's impossible to progress any further."

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don't understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I'm supposed to have 92, I don't get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don't care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn't count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I'm going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn't come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game."

The developer's done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it's still fun. Can't wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!",
        "This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she'll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she's tried. I'm really happy i found this game!!",
        "This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don't have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There's nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I'm level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)",
        "I really love this game, but if you don't put an update on Clumsy Ninja I'm going to uninstall this awesome game. In the next update will you please fix the part when you touch the story book then it tells you the pictures are still locked? If you put this in the new update anytime, I will start to love this game like I did before. One more thing.... If this helps.... I really really really love this app!!!",
        "I love this game, it's simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I'd really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the 'I' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.",
        "This is a great game that I've played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it'd still fun to play. My only gripe is that there's no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it'll be 5 stars all the way for me."

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Awesome game, one of my favourites. Only suggestion would be that the bonus hours of unlimited lives could be gameplay hours, not actual time hours as it is sometimes impossible to continue playing depending on when you are awarded the bonus but on the plus side there are many opportunities to get bonus hours or recharges, much more than many other games.",
        "Since today I've started getting in game app adverts...  Terrible considering it only says in app purchases. What a joke a bit like the stupid pig you gave us for gold bars which you made out to be free but no... Of course you have to purchase so why put that rubbish in the game! If I wanted to check if I have PPI I'd wait for a cold caller, not an in game advert! You take the living p*ss!",
        "Fun & super adorable match 3 game - the only game I've kept playing for years (3-4?!) Variety of different mechanics and choice of animal helpers keep it interesting, and less frustrating than the Candy Crush games. Then again, maybe it's just because everything is so darn cute! So nice to see the New Zealand birds/animals in there too, go kiwi! :)",

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!"

Each believe that their way of life is the only way, and are dedicated to teaching their polices to all other nations through what there leaders claim as divine intervention, or as you will know it... war. <br><br>The others are known as: &quot;Archidons&quot; the way of the archer, &quot;Swordwrath&quot; the way of the sword, &quot;Magikill&quot; the way of the mage, and &quot;Speartons&quot; the way of the Spear. <br><br>You are the leader of the nation called &quot;Order&quot;, your way is of peace and knowledge, your people do not worship their weapons as gods. This makes you a mark for infiltration by the surrounding nations. Your only chance to defend is to attack first, and obtain the technology&apos;s from each nation along the way.",

        "Don't get me wrong, this game is great, its fun, addictive and all around a 5 star, but I gave it only 1 because even if my internet connection is perfectly stable, I still crash mid-game because of \"connection issues\". And its not only once or twice, I've had days where I am hours upon hours trying to play, but I can't, sometimes I even crash before the game itself has started, so that's why I only gave it 1 star.",
        "This game is a game I can proudly say I will never delete. I hadn't played this game for very long but I have loved it so much. The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It's never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.",
        "It was very fun testing the early access! And the thing that i noticed was the new token system. Im not saying the token system was bad, but i liked the older system better. On how there were bronze, silver, and gold stars, and the star depended how good the item was. I was wondering why you changed it. благодаря!",
        "Excellent game. Highly replayable. Fun and challenging. My only issue is that emotes switch from one side to the other when playing as a thief vs playing as a sniper. Plus, having to hit a button to fire vs just hitting the right side of the screen is a bit more difficult. Otherwise, almost perfect game.",
        "WARNING: YOU WILL BE HOOKED AS SOON AS YOU START THE GAME. The game is really cool, I love the gadgets, the replayability, variety of maps, and how this could be free to play. Even though there are alot of glitches, these improvements will make up for them",
        "Its greedy from the developer to make bigger price of silver and other chests every time when i get close enough to amout of gold needed for buying it. First the price of silver chest was 80 then when i got 60gold price gone to 110 then when i had 90 gold it got up to 130 its like they are pushing me to spend money and i never did that. Good game but so greedy that it deservs one star!!!!"

I also liked how they added in most winter sports stuff but I do wish it was easier to get gems. I loved this game there were the right amount of ad's and it was very addicting. If this game gets even better than I will rate it five stars",

        "Summer sports is great fun winter sports could be good but it lags so much probably due to the adverts that are always shown. I have downgraded to 1star as the lags and adverts have got worse",

Terrible, terrible controls.  Edit: I'm happy to say they removed the Flip and Die feature and now the game is quite enjoyable. Well worth playing!",

        "Very good game. I have a level 20 indominus rex even though I'm only level 50. and I'm trying to evolve it to level 40. I think that the element of creating your own hybrids is amazing. I think my personal favourites are yudon, indominus rex and ostaposaurus (in the game) and majungasaurus, T-rex and triceratops (that I have currently)  My only complaint is there's no aquatic, cenozoic or solid gold hybrids which I think would add a cool aspect to the game. And maybe some super hybrids made from 2 of the normal hybrids. (Recent) now for some reason I can't claim my reward for the Acanthostega tournament even though my game is updated to the latest version. Please fix this or send an email suggesting to/telling me what happened to stop me from getting my reward.",
        ".     It doesn't tell you how to get past level 75. Or how super power your dinosaurs,  example the opponents dinosaurs that have the purple glow. Also unable to redeem the points on either visitor world or the world ran by facebook. Jurrassic World the game also doesn't tell or show you how to get your dinosaurs to the ultimate stage where  these issues. That's why they get a poor rating from this consumer. If everyone boycotted the game and cancelled their memberships, you can guarantee they would fix all glitches and explain away the issues that are asked.",
        "I love the game. Its amazing. The biggest problem I encounter is the loading time of the game. I use a verry good wifi conection and even in this case it takes 35 minutes to load the game. Btw I have a huawei p9 and extra memory card of 125 gb so no storage problems. Since download I still have this long time in loading. To bad the game is amazing.",
        "I was enjoying this game for 5 minutes, and then I couldn't get into it anymore. It tells me to make more then 900 mb space even though I just deleted a couple of gb worth of apps. Once I can play this again it will be fun",
        "It's a great game but it's such a money pit. 9 out of 10 times if you want something, you better get a credit card out otherwise you're waiting 4 days to unlock it. If it weren't for that, I'd have given 5 stars.",
        "Look it's good but the tournament is way to hard because I have to fight halos and a level 10 I rex and I only have 3 legendary and when they lose I only have a super rare and commons so why when I have this it a good idea to put a person who has one hybrid halo and two legendary. It's just hard okay to win this dinosaur."

        "Maybe the reason people think its boring. It's probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn't because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn't have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can't handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn't for you.",
        "The game controls are very annoying. The character won't go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",
        "These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I'm downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol",
        "I would get to the title page and that was it. It won't let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.",
        "It's an disaster game. It doesn't even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.",
        "So, this game is very exciting, but i have problems with defeating the monsters, and after this \"update\" nothing changed, so next time make new levels! I MEAN, COME ON !! Other than that, game is great."

I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging",
        "Terrible. I looked up the rules for risk the defender defends with one less than the attacker,but on here they will do the exact same amount as u and will defend with two even though u have only one attacking. After that I tried the blitz thing and I lost 6 characters even though I had the advantage. Horrible game. Never going to plsyvthis game ever again.",
        "This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.",
        "This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I've to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this 'replaying' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I've both a very good data and wifi connections.",
        "Was fine for a couple weeks.... Then it started freezing up in the middle of my games.... All of them. I'm using a LG V30+ with 128g ram so it's definitely not a lack of storage issue.   I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone who likes uninterrupted gameplay.",
        "I joined to get the one free game per day. Be aware, that if you do not subscribe (like me), the dice are loaded...  I actually had an army of 9 or 10 roll over against an army of 1 on quite a few occasions... statistically highly improbable."

I like this game because you can do roleplay and I'm a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won't let me play it please fix that and reply",
        "Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.",
        "I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!",
        "I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin",
        "I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx",
        "Its a great game but can you guys fix how people be spawning and walking through vehicles? Got blown up inching a truck out the doc, aomeone mpc apaqned in and i got killes for accidently running them over at 1 inch per minute."

Remember that physics is your assistant. Win in battles without rules wrestling, to get rid of these ridiculous dreams about the fall of human on a flat floor.",

        "This game is just a cash grab.  Just a little thought and the dev got obviously greedy. Have to buy literally everything with real life money,  there's no incentive to play more than 5 minutes.",
        "This game is brilliant!!!!!! The gameplay is magnificent and the power ups are amazing. This really really gets everyone laughing when the players fling out the cars, especially the kids. What you guys could do over there is make a button that randomises the cars that you have. Great game. I would definitely recommend it to a friend",
        "A fun downhill racer with cool weapons, cars, and avatars. One of those avatars looks suspiciously like JackSepticEye, which renewed my interest.  One suggestion... instead of immediately over with the littlest hit, apply a damage or time limit for a better end wreck.",
        "Was pretty fun! Untill the rediculous amount of Ads after the first try! I don't not want to watch 3 videos between plays, absolutely rediculous",
        "This is another game where the person who made it tried to be like the guy who created flappy bird: meaning he's trying to get rich via a crappy game that shows ads cosistantly. Honestly, I can't do anything to make you choose, but if I were you, I would turn the game down just because of the expenses and the ads. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!!! Fair enough, the graphics, controlls, etc. are quite good and the dummy reactions are HILARIOUS sometimes. But if you don't get at least 1000/2000/more then, again, a waste of your precious lifetime.",
        "I love the game it is soo funny when I fall the little avatars they make me feel so much better. I love it how you get new and diffrent cars. Make sure you get this game it looks boring but it is soo fun :)"

Very grindy game, though I love it for this exact reason. I have been playing for over 5 months total know. All I can say is; Keep up the great work devs! You're rocking this game! Cant wait for more raids to be added! :D The new fishin is a little on the lame side. I like that its the only completely free2WIN event in the game, but 20 bait per day is such a sad amount ): Last an all of 5 minutes, if that! Please change the prices in fishin shop and give at least 50 bait per day! Other than that, BEST Game on the market by a looooong shot! Nothing else comes close to how awesome this game is. Oh and the community is wicked! (Other than the 10yr olds but just gotta ignore them, yes there is a block option in game for this!)",
        "Interesting..reminds me of playing an old Zelda game. Takes a second to get used to finding areas outside of the dungens but overall I like it",
        "This is the best f2p game I've found yet. Hours of daily gameplay and all ads are optional, but rewarding. Time played is what sets players apart, not how much money they have. Plus the premium currency (gems) is earned pretty steadily as you play.",
        "Return to the erea of 32 bit games. Remember the feeling of playing arcade games with real people in the 80's. Feel the pride of helping other players grow or smash them In pvp. Love this player driven grinding game. May RNGesus smile on you in Bit Hero's."

Cute animals and decorations. Love that I have several choices on some items. I hope new animals and habitats are available soon!",

        "This game is ridiculous.   Have to do games to get things and then when you open up to get animals youbthen have to play multiple games to get items to expand or play or train.  Way too much and only get 5 lives for all the different games you are forced to play.",
        "The game is enjoyable but I don't care for the new animated Charlotte. Instead of adding \"realism\", she is simply annoying. Other than that, it's fairly good. The number of coins needed to continue a level with 5 extra moves is a bit much compared to the number received when you complete the level (300 vs 25-30 or so). I understand, though. It can't be too easy or else it would be boring & nobody would ever spend any $ to advance!😁"

        "Well to start off... Most of the games need you to be a VIP. I mean why can't the normal players play some games? That's all I'm saying. On the bright side, I like the game. Yes and I said LIKE. It's fun, creative, and I also love that you just need one username. Now people who play this don't have to keep a bunch of usernames and passwords. Thanks. 😀☺",
        "This was an awesome game! I love how if we have VIP on BSP or MSP we have VIP on BP too! This is an amazing game but I hate how the shirts are VIP now. And also, stop complaining that VIP costs money because if it didn't we wouldn't have this game right now like you can't just magically produce a good game you have to waste money to keep it open and make it so really, just stop complaining.",
        "I REALLY NEED TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD AND IT DOSENT HAVE A OPTION FOR IT AND NOW ONE OF MY FRIENDS CAN GO ON MY ACCOUNT WITHOUT ME KNOWING AND I RLLY NEED IT CHANGING OR I WILL NO LONGER PLAY! MAKE A CHANGE/FORGOT PASSWORD OPTION  OR I WILL (NO JOKE) NO LONGER PLAY",
        "LOVE THIS GAME . but I have one problem I won this VIP egg and got the coins to unlock it but I have to become a VIP to unlock it.",
        "Well people are rude , I get people saying they've been hacked and i dont see how it is rated a 3 plus and people said they fancied me and people say really horrible things and all the shirts are now for VIP which COST money but i only have this app so i can talk to my friends but roblox is way better",
        "This is the best game ever download this app and you'll  be so happy you make a captain boonie  and you buy them as well and you can become vip and get the best ones that other people can't  get but you haft to pay real money to become vip"

Because sometimes you phone just turns off and once you turn it on again its just like have some addddddddddddddddddddddddds",
        "This is pretty sweet.  Its a great way to make stylized graphics  A lot of reviewers were complaining that it has a ton of ads tho, but you can get rid of them for 99 cents.  If you like this, dont whine just pay the piper or play something else.  Develepers have to eat, ya know???  If you want a free alternative, (or if you are curious about how this stuff works) i suggest looking into the open processing language.  You can learn to make your own cool stuff like this by finding a couple of algorithms online   Also, if you have a good graphics card in your pc/mac and you are interested in this stuff  check out touch designer.  You can make some really amazing realtime art  But seriously, support these developers if you like the program.  Its that simple.  99 cents is not much money!!  Ok luvya byebye",

The only bad thing is that there is kind of a lot of ads.But, that's fine! Its SUPER satisfying to me, and my sister! So, as you think, you should download this app.",

It have been updated very much which decreased the excellence of this game. At last, I want to say that if possible, please bring the old game back which can increase ratings of game and it has now a really big storage.I have played it few years ago and it was good than new one. Cant you bring old angry birds go back 😯😯😯",

        "Cutest virtual pet game around! I've never had an app so simple, yet it never gets boring. The controls are simple and user-friendly. It's easy to earn money, food and useful items just by shaking trees in the community or watching ads. I've gotten many things from letting my Boo sleep and watching ads, then getting to pick a gift. The customization of your personal boo is also fantastic. Great way to entertain children or unwind at the end of the long day.",
        "Do you have a pet? If not, My Boo is a great way to know how it feels to have something to look after. With loads of awesome mini games, it's so fun to dress your Boo up in cute outfits and hairstyles! Feed it and play with it and it will love you! Honestly, I don't know how else to put this: My Boo is the best (and cutest) game ever!",
        "This game is really fun and cute!! I love it, its great when you're super bored, or something. The only problem I'm having, is the when I go to change my boo's name, it won't let me delete any of the letters. Sooo... Yeah, um, other than that, its a great game. Also... WHY NO DELETE!?!? 😲 plz fix.",
        "It lets you change the style/look. And you can name your boo and lots more! I at first didn't think I really would appreciate it. It  is fun it is also sooooo cute you can name your boo anything you like l think it's the best game in the whole world!",
        "I love this game. It is like taking care of a real child. I'm glad this is a free game bc now that ik how this app works I don't think i would be able to live without. The only thing I don't like is how it takes so much time to move to the next level. 💖💟🖤💜💛💚💙💞🐞😻",
        "I love this app. I have searched long and hard for a perfect virtual pet, and I found it in this cute little game. I LOVE the minigames, and the cute little sounds and faces the boo makes add to the charm of this game. Also, I love how there are a TON of options for customization, and even different kinds of food. I only wish there weren't so many ads and in app purchases... Oh well, a little thing like that won't stop me from loving this app.  My little Boo is named Marcellus, and I care for him as though he were a real animal. Lol"

        "I think this game is pretty cool! Also they added more houses to play in. I love multi-player because I like to see all the scores and I don't like the office because their's spiders and I hate spiders. I beat the Christmas level and I'm trying to beat the other levels too. But when you start the game, it says choose cat and press it and there's a skinny cat with the ears    down. I choose the kitten. But I LOVE the garden level because you go on the slides and you can go in the house and go out of it and go on the carousel and more! But on the picture when you download the game, the cat is in the washer and in the fridge. But you can't do that in the game. I tried too. Its boring at first but it's fun! I also don't know where the cats house is. Is it in the first house? I TOTALLY love it.😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😺😺😺😺😺😺😸😸😸😸😸😸😻😻",

Is it possible to fix this issue?",

Nothing special bout the control, but there is one thing that not much game in this genre had... It is offline mode. But still there is some part that you guys can be a bit loosen up like let all this game players have free vip fiture. That definitely will give more excitement the the play. So may please considered this suggestion here... There still lot more part to be improve by you all guys. Thx",

        "Absolutely nothing to do after completing campaign mode because all the events after RQ100 are pvp based and with a RQ150 limit while you are only around RQ110 - 115 when you complete campaign.  Even if you paid a lot of real cash to roll for good S class cars it does not mean you could go further after the relatively short campaign mode.  The game is so dead after you 100% the campaign and there will hardly be any reward for you to make way to RQ125 + in order to be competitive in those pvp events again.  This game probably just last 2 weeks tbh.  Great hope and great let down.",
        "Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your \"mind\" to win. I'm not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It's unlike any game I've played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person's game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing \"while\" they play, smh HAHA!",
        "I love the concept and it's been great to see how far this game has come, but I've been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don't get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book",
        "Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.",
        "I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can't stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it's on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)",
        "Free to play gamers dont bother! The beta was good, the career will only progress you so far but not enough to be competitive against pay to win players. Hutch has done little to rectify this and has alienated non-spenders. I imagine about a months worth of play before the game gets uninstalled for the majority of players"

It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won't reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.",
        "Special episodes are impossible to win. Final episodes includes more than 14 races, a day is 24 hours and we slept about 8 hours. So we need to be on alert and play each hour without losing. Make them a little bit easier or make 5 tickets price 30 golds not 90.",

I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don't have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don't expect to progress very far if you don't want to spend money."

        "The game has gorgeous graphics. Each scene is very detailed and fun to play. Some are a little difficult to get through if you like to keep your brightness low like me and some items are incredibly tiny to find. But it has a fun premise and it's a pretty good time waster. However, you can't play for long. Each play takes 20 energy and it goes by quickly. Waiting for it to refill takes a long time. Getting stars to solve cases also takes some time. It's basically the wait time in this game that kinda kills it.",
        "This is a really enjoyable game, especially for fans of HP and/or the fantasy genre. The graphics are beautiful and the characters look so real. I just wish energy wasn't used up so quickly. At 20 points of energy a pop you can't really play for long, and the XP needed to level up is also high so you usually have to wait for the energy to refill. Also, when you level up you don't get a complete energy refill; you only get about half. Waiting time to complete tasks is also too high IMO. At least a couple of hours if not longer. With any other game this is usually enough to turn me off but the gameplay, the story and the graphics are so good that I'm willing to exercise a lot of patience.",
        "Decent premise. I'd love this game if only you had more life available. It makes you use several rounds of life to get these stars but then makes you use 1 star per task. Its extremely tedious. I do enjoy the scene hunts you basically have to find the objects in the picture, and get points which add up to a star.  It just moves too slowly....",
        "It's a good game but having to wait so long for the energy build up takes away the excitement of the game play. Iv noticed alot of other game users have the same outlook on this game. Even the timers for tasks take way to long.. 6 hours to complete? Really? Why so long? People will get bored and find another stimulating game. This is based on the whole wizarding world so it should be alot more magical and less time consuming.",
        "Love the game overall but it takes way too long to build up energy. Because of this you are only able to play for very short periods of time before you have to wait for the energy to build back up. Also some of the 'inspection' actions take way too long. Waiting 6+ hours for an action to be completed is excessive. I would love to be able to play the game for more than just a couple of minutes a day. I realize it is done to encourage people to make in app purchases, however, perhaps you could provide a paid version of the app to avoid this. I love the game and would love to be able to play it more.",
        "Love this game, but it has only 14 cases!! WTH?? The last case acted like you were going on to another one, but no. Feel like it shouldn't have been released with only 14 cases. Very similar to Criminal Case in a lot of ways. The upgrades help a lot, but it takes a while before you notice their effect and cost is too high, IMO."

        "This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!",
        "It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don't even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.",
        "I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don't like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can't buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens",
        "Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!",
        "4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I'm well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant"

        "Okay listen, this app is surely good and relaxing, but I must say, i am having trouble with getting the game right easily. What I am trying say is sometimes the game freezes and I am coming upon some glitchey reactions. I would really appreciate if you made the game a little more calm or just review some things you can edit. I would like to keep contact with you. So if you have any suggestions on how you can make the game a little better just let me know. I'm looking forward to some edits here so I hope you can figure something out. I'm not trying to be bossy, I'd just wanted a little arrangement for your game. So just keep working hard on your games. Thank you very much! Okay now I gotta play the game. Bye!",
        "I do like this game.  It definitely keeps my attention and is somewhat addictive however,  there are way too many ads in this game which is why I only gave it a 3 star rating. Seriously,  everytime you reach a new level or hit retry you get ads, ads and more ads, just ridiculous! DEFINITELY makes me want to uninstall the game sadly.",
        "UPDATE- STILL NO MORE LEVELS ONCE I'VE GOTTEN TO 1190.. IF THIS IS THE END PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN DELETE APP AND MY HUSBAND CAN STOP WASTING HIS TIME PLAYING IT!!! ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I'm on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn't have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!",
        "Its a fun game but the animations move very fast and it's hard to tell what's going on. Also, there are way too many ads",
        "Does what it says on the label. Airplane mode takes care of the ads. Happy to make a purchase to remove them though. Good time wasting game. Thanks guys for a great app!",
        "It was exactly what I was wanting to play.  Also unlike other previews, yours is what you show right away not after a bunch of other games that are not worth playing to get to the game you thought you had downloaded."

        "This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I've tried that you'd think would make something but don't. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.",
        "Love love love it solo much, it made to the top ten best games in my head! It has more items but mixing some items don't really make  sense like Domestication and grass makes wheat that is one item that don't make sense otherwise you can cheat from little alchemy 1 so yeah 55 star from me!",
        "I love this game. At first time I open it after download, it still okay. But after that, at second day I open the app, my phone will be turned off immediately. I try to uninstall it and just redownload today, but still same. My phone keep turned off if I open the app. Please fix this, I really really want to play :(",
        "This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won't let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I've used it before, but now it won't let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.",
        "This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they've all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.",
        "The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one."

        "Every time I open a pack after I finished the draft I would have to waste a pack just so I can open one and sometimes I can't open all of my packs so I don't know how they fixed the bugs also the game crashes at random times",

        "An awesome game until a few days ago when Online trading and Online drafts stopped working, I have the latest update...what seems to be the problem Pacy Bits??"

        "I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can't find Bradinsky song. It's okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol",
        "Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can't play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",
        "Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on 'player choice' lately."

There aren't many strains, would be cool if you could create alot more strain by mixing or idk discovering by accident. Those would add to the game.

        "It's a good game except for some reason it used over 5 gigabytes of data on wifi in the background for some reason or another. It uses your wifi even when you tell the game not to run in the background. I just think that's really strange and I demand an explanation for why it is using so much bandwidth on wifi. I'm only really concerned because I am on a metered connection.",

        "Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It's the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I'm a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.",
        "Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn't get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn't give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5",
        "I'm trying to link my account to my other one by using my blizzard account that I already have. But it just makes me do the tutorial and after I completed it, it just keeps on doing the starter stuff. Even though I already have a blizzard account with my hearthstone rank 20, but it just restarts me back to ,25. I'm not sure its a glitche or I'm doing something wrong but It just wont let me log in my account.",
        "Coming from a seasoned player: this game has turned into trash. If you want to stay competitive you must invest hundreds of dollars each time they introduce another set into the cards. Essentially the decks stay the same but cards must be purchased/collected to stay competitive and even then... the strategy gameplay is broken. If you have unlimited funds it can still be fun but to any newcomers reading this : Find another game.",
        "I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.",
        "What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can't win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!"

Since playing the game more I've decided that there's not enough gas for me to be able to enjoy the game like I want to. I think the car should either hold more, or gas should be easier to get. This is just a game that already has inconsistencies with reality. Otherwise I love the game",

Build a camp, in order to multiply resources, because you will need them to improve other buildings. Also, to note, this game will not allow you to get stronger unless you improve your camp. I have survivors who cannot level up until I Improve the council. The training grounds will not be built any further unless you improve the council. Its like a city/fort building game with tactical rpg feel to it.  There is a leaderboard, that actually awards you for being at a certain tier. You can join guilds to help get better gear. I love this game!  ...The con that I have with this is that every time of logging on, deals are thrown in my face, and it is enticing too.",

Sometimes during auction the timing finishes earlier than it should be. I hope the game developer will look into every aspect of improving the game in order to sustain this game as one of the most entertaining ones.

        "It's a good game but having an add after every puzzle is a bit much. Yake a bit too much time and easyy to lose interest. Maybe every 5 puzzles wo ups be better I know y'all gotta make your money but the constant ads make me want to uninstall.",
        "Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can't figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy",
        "Really fun game! Just a couple of itsy bitsy things that get on my nerves. The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??",
        "The game  is good but alot  of  adds keep poping up. but i know you guys got to make your money and that.  my kids like to play this game and they enjoy playing it but sometimes the photos don't really make sence and then they lose intrest in the game and even some times im teptered to uninstall this game sometimes when i get mad with this game.",
        "Great game. You should definitely earn at least 5 coins by default  when you solve a puzzle instead of 2 and more when watching an ad. The game seems Americanised (I'm British)  and  I didn't recognise some of the words (webmail?). Very fun though!",
        "So... I love the idea for this game. The pictures do not represent the words in the slightest. AT ALL! When you look at a photo, it Should be one of the first words to come to mind, or at least the 5th, but some of these pictures are just so freaking terrible. Just play it. You'll hate this game because how the hell are shirt sleeves representative of clothes? You have to play to understand. This is the worst game that I cannot stop playing. I have to look up half the answers because the picture is a monopoly board and the word is \"house\"... like what the heck guys?!"

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.",

        "I absolutely love love LOVE this game. Im no bot i swear. This game is so addictive. Gameplay is great. A few suggestions however. Sometimes i find my \"sword\" just going right through some fish, and it doesnt kill them. Also, maybe switch up some ways to get Stars. I find myself saving so much to get the 99k sword fish and never buy any other fishes. I feel like the players should work their way up slowly and not have to play with only the \"daily reward\" fishes. Just my suggestion  Thank you guys!",
        "Great game, good servers, rarely any lag, and addicting. However, the price for characters is pretty steep, their not even worth buying since you'll get better daily characters by the time you have enough stars to buy a good character. Save up for the end game characters. Also, the left joystick is fairly close to the edge of the screen and makes it a little hard to stay on the screen. You get use to it after a while but it would be nice to have other control setups or custom controls.",
        "Great game. Just the spawns on Kill the King and stuff suck since people can spawn right in you. Also, it is kinda rigged when you have the default fish vs someone with one of the best ones.",
        "Great game, its so addicting!  But there is only 1 problem, theres so much lag. Pls fix!! :)",
        "You guys have so much potential and you can do allot I know it! Dab on the HATERS (even though there hating you because they can't make a game and hate ads) but one thing WHY IS ALL CHARACTERS 99.99$ I know other games do it but still lower price and I will rate 5",
        "Ok, So The only reson why i gave it a 4 is because it made me rage. Ao that was the only reson but other than that i would rate it a 5 star !"

It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won't ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn't do any good either. They don't ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don't waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn't it.",
        "DO NOT DOWNLOAD CAN NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A BUG!!!!!!  After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!",
        "I really like it and how you get to interact with other people. The only thing that bothered me were the hints being super obvious. Not very helpful. Also, some things are glitchy. Like I know I pressed certain things and it couldn't detect my finger. But overall good game!!",
        "It would be a good game if it didn't keep freezing up on me. It's a shame too because I really love these types of games (like Escape from the Titanic). Couldn't get past the level where the inmate has the task of cleaning the glass pane and has to gain entry into the clerks' office...it just freezes up and I can't resolve it no matter what I tried.",

They don't ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.",
        "On a serious note, you need to give me this game for free. I downloaded and played two different games to get the game for free and 5 hours later I still don't have the full game. I've had to install 5 different games just to get this one for free and I STILL don't have the full game. I'm not impressed!!!"

        "Gosh. Just.... too perfect. It's almost like a rich girl's real life. Just shop and compete against some other people. Coco play is my fav game app... thing. Whatever you call it. But.. it has so much adds. Excluding the get for free things. Still, five stars! Highly recomended.  Thank you.",
        "It's the best game I have ever played..... Nothing is locked except a few....... And you can mostly buy things..... There are different shops like one for parties one for free style one for gowns..... There are two or three makeup shops there is a hair salon a jewellery shop..... I think every one should try this game at least for once.......and this is the best game of the coco games so I think try it for once......",
        "Its an suberp game and i like to play it but one thing should be improved that whenever there is a sale the time limit of it should be increased the reason is that maybe some one will be playing the contest and the sale advertise will come but they cant go and when they come to that store the sale is finished. but its really nice game and girls would love it but they show so much ads.this should be improved.rest its a lovely game and organizations of the game are awesome",
        "Great game! I think it's stupid that everyone is pitching fits because of ads. It takes time and money to develop these games so either buy it or quit bitching. But overall I enjoy the game, I find it relaxing and it allows for unlimited creativity. I would like more clothes, accessories  and make up added. One fun thing to add to the game would be hats. Thanks.",
        "There is one problem  problem one make everything free cause I can pick anything when I don't have enough money OK OK!   And also liked this game!  But just what I said make all the items free!",
        "The game is attracting. Once I play in want to keep on playing. I have a complaint against the controls it is a little slow. This time I am giving 5 stars but next time it will be 2"

        "Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It's Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I'm Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "Fastest uninstall ever. 15 seconds of gameplay, then 15 seconds of timed add. Can anyone spot the fake reviews? Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout"

        "I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I'm in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it",
        "The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it's difficulty like crazy, I can't get past the 200s. Not sure if it's a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it's because I completed challenges but I don't appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don't feel evenly matched :(",

        "Love that the hints don't just give you the number. They walk you to the answer step by step, so you can stop after the first step that direct your focus and use as just a nudge in the right direction so you can actually learn and improve your skills. Very aesthetically attractive graphics. Lots of options for layout and features to toggle on and off. Only cons are the number tiles are right next to each other so I sometimes hit the wrong one if I'm not totally centered on the number. Also I wish I could see my top three scores for each category to see how I've improved, instead of just the best.",
        "I like this game but there's an inherent issue with how you check correctness of a solution. Your assumption that there could be just one solution to a puzzle is wrong. It happened with me, I found a correct solution but I guess it did not match with what your algorithm found so it considered it wrong and the check feature would wrongly mark the unmatched numbers even though they are correct. If you want I can send you a picture of my solution.",
        "If you are willing to put your thinking cap on this game will provide hours of entertainment as well as practice at using your thought process. This is the most pleasant past-time I have found among Android games.  Plus I have never had to deal with an over abundance of advertising. The programming team that put this game together are awesome.",
        "I love the number painting. Makes it much quicker to solve the puzzle. I don't so much like the animation at the end of game when you have to wait for it to count up to your score. Maybe it's just my phone (or my age?), but I find it hard to see the possible numbers when that number is highlighted. White number with yellow highlight over it -- not a good combo.",
        "The best of the Sudoku games I've tried.. Only complaint is being asked to rate over and over, even after game has been rated More and more ads are not allowing me to close the ad without installing the advertised app or powering down my device.  THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!!!",
        "Overall, great sudoku, helped me emerge as a professional sudoku player in the Himalayas. I have made you proud again sensei, by the strength of the Shimada clan I found my inner peace, through the lens of the Sharingan, I see the truth, and through the legacy of the Rrasengan of the 4th Hokage, I have brought honor to the Shinobi. It's also got 5 different levels of difficulty."

        "My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)",
        "Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I've been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!",
        "I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that's  called cause usually that's the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can't  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I'm  sure it does others as well.",
        "I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn't have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I'm about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo",
        "It's been nice...I'm happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you \"Dataverse\", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can't spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck",
        "I love this game. But i have a problem with this game. Sometimes i won 500 tickets and extra tru the tournament but my tickets went missing without i play the bingo. It getting reduced by itself. So pls you guys should take action on this maybe someone is spaming my game and stealed my ticket. This not fair to me. Please return back my tickets that have gone for nothing. Dont cheat me like this."

Update few days later...   Suddenly the game keeps crashing randomly...   Tried it for days....   Can hardly survive a single level now...    Very sad....   The game itself is still excellent....   Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",
        "Fun game, my daughter enjoys playing. ..easy, yet challenging at the same time.  One irritating issue...every time there's an update, or just opening the app, turns on the game's notifications..and have to turn it off constantly. ..otherwise it would be a rare 5 star rating from me.",
        "This is by far one of the best games I have played like this all year. Very addicting, easy, but challenging enough to keep you wanting to come back play some more. Haven't found something I don't like about this game just yet😁",
        "The game isn't letting go of the balls. When I let it go, it switches to the other available ball. I may spend 10 minutes trying to shoot a ball. Very annoying & irritating, but I like everything else!",
        "Like with all other games this game is rigged, once you get to a certain level you are set up to fail unless you buy coins. I don't play games so I can go broke on coins, I don't like this.",

Also at times the ball just flies across the map when barely touched or landed on.",

You can turn off your mobile data and the hands still runs without a hitch. They wee so far as to randomize behavior of the AI. By that I mean in done matches your opponents or team mate will just stop, implying an AFK event. Anyway its a fun game Bhutto don't be a sham Devs.. Mean what you say and say what you mean.."

BUT may photos temperature started to climb and quickly shot through the roof to a point where it literally burns you! And it kills your battery! For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.",
        "Silly pointless battery killing little game, I loved it! The game kinda runs out of puff after level 150 though, as there is nothing else to achieve. I've got all the prestige balls, all the regular balls, all above level 150. Can we have some higher order balls above Thunder please?",
        "Looks BORING at first. But I can't put it down now. And to those complaining about the adds, spam the back button after they start. The only adds this doesn't work for are the ones with the fast forward button in the top left",
        "AD INFESTED! Opens up adds (videos) every time you level up pretty much, which is every 5-15 seconds in the beginning. I cannot give this a proper review when half the game is just watching ads.",
        "Would give this a better review, but there are so many glitches. You can only upgrade a booster once, then you have to close the app and open it again so you can keep upgrading. Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.",
        "The first thing that happens when you open the game is collect what you've earned while you're away. And whether or not I pick the X2 option I have to wait through a 30 second add. Every. Time. Whoever decided to force adds at every collection is costing the developer a lot of money."

        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "It's a  fun game but it's rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn't be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I'm bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I'm level 43 .",
        "Amazing.  It's just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I've played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.",
        "This is a fun game however it allows people to cheat or it's rigged. It's no coincidence that the better I play the better my opponent plays. I think half the time we are playing a rigged computer. I spent $50 on this app in a week and I am deleting it now. Sorry crooked people that run this app."

        "Cute game, but not without it's flaws. I forgot the reasons I deleted the game in the past, but remember them now. It drains your battery, the life refresh time is high (20 minutes) and starting at a certain level (30) you really can't progress WITHOUT friends (this is not a positive for everyone. I personally don't like it), or money, or a ton of patience. You need keys to progress. You can either buy, ask friends, or play for one every FOUR HOURS. This is the exact point where I uninstalled the game last time.",
        "I would taste this game higher if the only way you could progress wasn't by having to purchase extras. Having to waste all my extras to get through a gate with 3 keys sucks and so does knowing that really the only way through is to buy your way through.",
        "I'm uninstalling game! I was really happy with game when I started,  now there is an ad every next life and sometimes more! Same ad over and over, enough to drive you CRAZY! Also you can't answer quick text or do anything off screen without the game totally rebooting,  it's supposed to be relaxing to play on phone,  NOT IRRITATING!",
        "Why bother having an X on the Level Rush notification if it doesn't work so you have to press Begin and wait for the animation to finish before you can carry on with claiming the Daily Challenge. Also 'play with friends' on the tournament never does anything. Otherwise fun.",
        "I have to uninstall. I love it, but it gets to the point that you cannot win.  So disappointed!!!!! I will say, this game has the very best customer service of any game I have ever played. Every single time, they go above and beyond. It's so sad when it becomes so frustrating that you can't keep playing a game that you love. I've spent b money trying to keep it fun, but I can't do b it anymore :(",
        "I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you're stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you're not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it."

EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can't wait to see the next game.

I only needed the clues for the very last level because I'm familiar with Bart's mind by now. &lt;3 I think it's great that clues are available though and that they don't give everything away right away. It's a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!",

        "This game is awesome. I love the different regions and new areas you can unlock. The only problem I have with it is that it forces you to upgrade your weapon or gear. Sometimes you just don't have enough dollars to do so and you get kinda Stuck. But, overall, I love it",
        "Bad Firstly it is very slow loading. Then it gaming possessing is bad. Some time it doesn't support touch.glu game is very bad",
        "I very much enjoy playing this game. Great gameplay, graphics, and a timeless concept keep you coming back for more, but there are a few issues I'd like to address that are major game changers regarding stability.  1. Chrashing! I've played the game for about only an hour, and it's crashed a good 6 times. I have more than enough storage, good enough connection, and yet it happens to crash after about every 2-4 hunts, which gets annoying very fast.   2. I keep getting messages saying that the server is having trouble connecting to Google Play services and to my account, although I have a strong connection.   It's a rather enjoyable game, but it still has a few bugs that can change the whole experience.",
        "To much upgrading! You should be able to hunt a entire region with 1 rifle without all the upgrades.  I realize you guys wanna make money but the amount of required updates it's ridiculous!"

        "This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don't have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I'm having issues getting into the game. It says \"check comnection\" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn't! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "Please bring back the old brewery map. I have been a long time player of this game, and loved the original brewery map. The new update of the map is so radical that it feels like an entirely different map, with all the pathways and corners. The uniqueness of the original brewery map is that it is small, and relatively open, so that combat is focussed and fun. There is more time fighting others than moving around trying to find enemy players. The new update just ruins that uniqueness, making it feel like the Bureau or Legacy map. I am okay with the new brewery map being a new addition, but please make it \"Brewery 2\" and bring back the original Brewery.",
        "Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn't work. PLEASE FIX.",
        "I love the game, it's great and there's not many fps games like these for mobile phones. My only problem is I can never play ranked. For whatever particular reason I can't even find other players. The game just stays searching forever and I really want to play ranked. I would have voted 5 stars but thats the only thing that bugs me. Please fix and will be happy to give 5 stars.",
        "Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn't have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.",
        "I love C-OPS. It is one of the best FPS games for Apple and Android devices. It is very popular, few servers are empty. On lowest settings with 2 gigabytes of RAM, it runs at a BUTTERY 50 frames per second. Also, controls can be customized. I just notice a few graphical glitches."

        "Some of the objectives are impossible complete. Like collecting the snowflakes in the big air. It's easy to find them but the locations they turn up make it impossible. And completing the rail slides in the halfpipe... I've done more than enough board slides of every type and it won't complete. Still gave 5 stars though. The game reminds me of the original Shawn white pro snowboarding games.",
        "Love the game. Disappointed that after making the quad exp purchase I am sti seeing ads. Kinda makes you not wanna play a game when you realize a developer is only out to nickel and dime customers to death...",
        "Really fun game with one glitch. Great graphics, great sound, really fun gameplay. However you cannot complete all the challenges. So as long as gamification completeness is not your goal and you can leave things showing as 14/15 complete then all is good.",
        "Ok so the last time I uninstalled was because the tutorial sucked and the menu was bad and the controls were horrific. Now with the new update, the same tutorials are finally finishable, the menu looks so much better. only thing keeping me from giving a five star are the controls, too sensitive",
        "Love it. Reminds me of my ssx tricky days, combined with the game objectives of Tony hawk's games. Played it once & immediately bought it. Well worth the money, I've already spent hours playing this",
        "Some of the mechanics of the game are broken. There are multiple goals I have completed (such as do a double backflip with any grab) that you don't get the credit for, and there's even a stage that won't unlock despite me completing every goal in the prior level while it apparently only needs 8 of the 15 to be done. Also, one of the goals is to complete a \"penta flip.\" I have no idea what this is, and it isn't included in the diagram of how-to's. As far as I know, this can't be done within the game. It's a decent game, but the freestyle tracks are very open and repetitive to the point of boredom. I do like how many modes there are though. If you're willing to deal with occasional ads you could do a lot worse than this game."

        "So after spending countless hours playing this and building my trophies and league up to gain max gems instead of adding more leagues you demote me almost 10 leagues and my daily reward is diddly squat now. And I most of my tokens have been reduced after I had built them up. I almost had Barber bugs up to 400 tokens. Starting to hate this game 😡",
        "Hey guys, so my favourite character is Tazzy Devil. Now you advertise him as a character in the game, I don't know if your going to update it or not but he's not in the game as of yet. Just wondering what's going on with that? If he's not in the game why advertise him?",
        "Please include tweety bird on the character. 😍😍😍👍👍👍  Bad update though toon task can't be collected. What just happened? The heck, its too hard to level up. The pieces are too huge.",
        "The new update has changed a lot of mechanics and features and it really feels odd from an old player and a Looney Tunes fan standpoint.  For instance, I might understand Porky Pig being moved to WB Studios, because he has had roles before such as a talent caster, but Road Runner?  Wile E. Coyote?  Ralph Wolf?  Really?  Even placing Marvin's house in WBS seems totally odd and questionable, that, ignoring the fact that the Space region is a thing in the universe.  The task mechanic also makes less sense.  One task point even for larger tasks?  And what about the Toons' houses?  They don't even change form after each upgrade and the \"bigger loot\" incentive still does not apply beyond Level 3.  Also, we kinda know for a fact that the wheels are rigged, but with the current update, you can't really make it more obvious.  I still love the game, but definitely less than before.",
        "The latest update has again reverted my progress while suddenly gifting me some toons I haven't earned. I don't understand what the Devs are trying to do with this, but what a mess",
        "Like the league store tho I wish it will sell more items used for upgrades. The league ranking was messed up due to the updates made. Players with 5000+ trophies are in higher leagues  than that of players with 12000+. Also,tried playing same invasion stage 3 times wasn't able to win the material that I need, did you change the probability again?!"

        "Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I'd rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.",
        "Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you're aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.",
        "Everything has been great till about 1 month ago when the graph is slowed downed. After you start off there's delays in the line of balls and very unsettling it's not continuous anymore.",
        "Game has so much potential and is a blast. I'm giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to \"use 200 gems to remove 3 lines\" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow",
        "Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it's annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere",

        "Cool game and really realistic. I give it a good rating. But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",
        "Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "Fun game that really passes the time. Only complaints I currently have are:  1. I just bought a new harvestor and there's no \"work\" button so I can harvest my crop. Trying to give it some time because it seems like a glitch. 2. I'd really like to be able to manage animals as well. Like chickens, pigs, goats, etc.  3. It would be nice to be able to store things IN the barn. 4. It'd take the game over the top if you could interact with and customize your house on the farm.",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

        "This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn't  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can't  exit,  overall  4.8!",
        "I love this game! As others have stated it's very addictive! It's also challenging when you get up in the amount of games you played. My only problem is that when you're asked to watch a video to collect points, the video stops playing and and you don't collect the points. This has happened to me 5 times in a row. Other than that, I do not know what people are talking about as far as a lot of ads. I don't find that at all.",
        "Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like 'cad.' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.",
        "Excellent game. Quite fast response on my phone. There is as almost after every level but it's ok. You can quickly click the x to close the ad. I was hoping for long words more than 6 letters but it appears that this game has only up to six letter word puzzles. I am currently at 490 level. From around 510 level onward, you only can make minimum 4 letter words. That makes it interesting an bit challenging.",
        "The game isn't bad if you like word puzzles. My dislike comes from the fact that I have push notifications for this app turned off, but it somehow continues to manage to send them. It also keeps poor track of your coins. Good time killer.",
        "Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an \"Extra\" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that's only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level."
