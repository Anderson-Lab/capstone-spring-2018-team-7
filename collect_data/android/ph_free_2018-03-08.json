        "Its a great competitive game with similar and different stuff compared to PUBG, and even does some things a bit better. But please nerf the vehicles hitbox radius and how many people can get into a car all at once. I've been killed 6 times now by someone or some people using only a vehicle and running other people over. Nerf the vehicles and I'll rate 5 star.",
        "This game is cool adictive best controls and cool cars, jeeps and also gliders.. but one thing to say: Update needed Every sunday they can get epic paints for guns and clothes,pants or in daily missions thats all. Oh wait how to use spray button to paint vechile job?",
        "The game really ok. I love the feature where you can talk to your team online. However, since I've updated my ROS, it became super loggy and now I can't even open it to play. I tried to re-install the game but still, it won't open anymore. What happen? Please fix it immediately.",
        "I love the game over all. There is one thing that ticks me off the cars. people get them then chase u and knock u down. Once u r knocked down they get out of the car and kill u. IT'S RIDICULOUS. The fact that you cant shoot through the fences makes it so others can use them as coves while u move to them and get killed",
        "No complaints about the game, i liked it. It's just that i lost my account today and i dont know what's the cause. last time i played it i closed the game when i finished a match by pressing the home button and left it there for a few hours. when i open the game again my account was lost. i forgot to bind my account to any social media because i thought i already binded it by sharing to facebook. is there any way you guys can help me ?",
        "This is F ridiculous!! I experienced more glitches after the update!! The updates didnt do anything much about the glitches!! People will just appear from nowhere!! I played this game everyday and every single day i always experience glitches!! The sound is also confusing even if you try to listen.You hear sounds that coming from the back but the enemy is actually in front."

        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "It's always been my favourite game I must say. The graphic aspects as well as the new features are very good. The only problem is that my troops and my village people are almost transparent since the first th11 update. Now I don't mind very much but it would be nice if you could solve this issue.",
        "Best game of the world. Very famous too but has one problem. Some upgrades take lot of time. And when we are tying it should be told like in whatsapp. See i understand it is difficult so u can increase the fond size of clan chatting so it can come. Pls do these changes. And there should be no supercell id. There should be a option through which we can make multiple accounts through one email only. And pls make the cost of upgrades less and increase the heroes in builder base and increase troops and heroes in both builder base and home village. And pls increase the town hall levels pls. And make builder base more interesting. And when someone new starts they should be given two accounts. Please do the following changes. And if more troops u can't think take some from Clash Royale and manage them.   THANKS",
        "It is the best game ..it's addictive and amazing ..Well done supercell..I m playing from 1 yr. and I m the 9 now..but plz decrease the amount needed for walls upgrade..&plz don't make it like 'Township'....Liked it much...😃😍 Plz do something to disable players from sending abusive words.. and remove trader bcz its a worst character that asks so much gems .."

All though  you have to pay for some parts of the game but out of all the games I have ever played this on is #1😍😂😃",
        "Fabulous word game. The whole family is addicted. Could do with a slightly wider vocabulary in that sometimes you find a perfectly good word that is not in the grid but it's not allowed in the bonus bank. But that's just being picky. Overall, well, well worth the modest price to go ad-free. Highly recommended.",
        "Great game, lovely graphics, but loses a star for not having valid words in its list; you can have pipe, pipes, pip but not pips.  The are lots of common words that are not accepted and I find it somewhat frustrating.  Secondly why do you no longer get coins for the words you find that are valid but not in the puzzle?",
        "My favorite word game, but I rated it only 4 stars because they repeat some of the puzzle groups as you progress through the game. I have gone through the Ocean group of puzzles at least twice now. With all the words in the English language, there is no reason for this. Also, there are many words, most quite common, that are not accepted.",
        "This is 1 of the word games I like to play that gives you coins for each extra word as you end each game level instead of having to build up to a certain number before you get the coins. I also love the scapes. . . They bring back memories from my youth and childhood.",
        "I love this game! It's a real challenge and better than the normal ones because of the backgrounds and how it's a crossword. You could add an online player vs player thing too. I love the daily challenges. Maybe add something to win instead of coins? If you love a good daily challenge defiantly get the game!! 😊"

Fix the matching system in ranked let good player matches with good player.  Repeated Afk player ban for 3 days.  Open the server so we can meet many players around the world not just in our server only 😠",
        "Great moba especially when you dont have time to sit in front of a computer to play life before. Only problem is lag has been an issue since a few updates before. Using home wifi and the ms will just jump around when fight starts and return to normal after a few seconds. Fights take a few second so its important. Currency is over priced and everything is super expensive. Looking for a new game now since these dev are all about pay to win now.",
        "Great MOBA game, but too many indonesian playing. keep on demoralizing other players. using profanity (e.g anjing = dogs, kontol = d!#khead.) can developers do something about this?  penalty them frm using such words. make them be suspended from ranking games or something. its really not a friendly game if you include this kind of players.",
        "I hate it! Everytime i tried to share my battle results the game got crashed all of a sudden. More than that, when i tried to streaming live on my Facebook account the game got restarted for no reason, leaving me to be reported bcs my teammate thought i was afk, but i wasn't! And oh! The lag oh boy it's unbearable",
        "Make the credit score penalty heavier. As, for players who AFK will be banned from playing rank few hours or days(it on you). Another one is could you make the macthmaking better. Eg if the Player winrate is 75% and match played 1000,they will be match with almost the same winrate and match played.",
        "DEVS. PLS FIX THE TUTORIAL AND NEW ACCOUNT THING.  Dammit. i  have an account but sometimes, when i reinstalled this game, it's start from the beginning. I already bind my account to googleplay and facebook tho..  pls fix this bug. THIS EXIST SINCE LONG TIME AGO. FIX. THIS.   and also pls erase that \"you can change account when u reach lv 8\" thing. this stressed me out. why i must lvling until lv 8 to change to my account?  back then u can change it freely even from the start. no requirement level back then.."

So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn't  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can't  exit,  overall  4.8!",

My only problem is that when you're asked to watch a video to collect points, the video stops playing and and you don't collect the points. This has happened to me 5 times in a row. Other than that, I do not know what people are talking about as far as a lot of ads. I don't find that at all.",

I know its the game because its when I'm about to pick up something important or jump at a crucial point. Also this ismy 3rd phone and it does it on all phones. This error needs to be fixed.",
        "I love the game. Been loving it for years. I've been noticing alot lately though that when I watch the ad video to double up on my mystery box, it's not doubling my prize. Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",
        "Could add more city's it sucks revisiting and not getting new characters.. also the special city boards could have some special effects instead of ... I don't know... looking like a hot dog... what's the point. A hot dog with super speed and stay low would be ideal. Love the game, but to keep playing.. maybe give us something new. The only thing I love is wordy weekends. But only to get the coins back for what I spent on the characters",
        "Sometimes, the game glitches and it's just very annoying when I have the super boots on and I jump on top of the train and then it glitches and the police catch me!  Apart from that very good game but I think the company just needs to improve the graphics...",
        "I can't even play, cause this is a bad day. And this makes it worse, its like seeing a bad nurse. I don't like it, it works for a bit. I don't like trash games, but it is not my fault I am calling it names. Fix it, or people get this bit. This is what I wrote, now write a note. Write a note about my problem, and stop em."

        "Ah perfect game. Fast pace not laggy smooth graphics, and playable on any devices. But i hope i can change my region like asian.. Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "For all this time I only played girly game like The Sims, Temple Run, etc but I decided to give this game a shot earlier today. GOD how I wish I tried it earlier! This is like the best game I've played in years, it's super playable even for someone like me (who have never played this kind of games before) and I just cant believe just how much this game has to offer! The graphic is flawless, no bugs or errors at all, the control is perfect, and it's superrr realistic. This game reminds me of Hunger Game lol. I feel emotionally exhausted while playing this game because I was always in a state of running and surviving. Very recommended!",
        "Its amazing!!!! I wanted fort nite but even if i deleted everything i have, i still would not be able to get it. It costs sooo much room. With this game, i can have roblox,color switch, and at least 100 pictures and 10 videos, AND still have room for it. This the best shooting game i have ever had! And i have played gta and call of duty. So that says a lot. It is also very fair. U dont get a increase on anything when wearing special clothing. So new comers could be just as good as people at lvl 100. I would deffenety recemend it.",
        "This is no doubt one the 'Best' android game ive ever played so far.       But the main drawback is the lack of map choice..  and i personally think that it would be better if there is more customisable features like hairstyles,etc. and more items to buy from the store using money and not diamonds. Another suggestion that i would like to give is that.. on top of having voice chat if teammates can chat with each other using message, it would be terrific. Thankyou for making this game!",
        "I have donated you guys, so you could improve and make the first, legendary phone game.  I have a few free suggestions to improve the gameplay coming from me (old, experienced gamer, graphic designer)  1. Add body and corpse ragdoll effect which will improve the heavy gameplay.  2. Add more blood (like blood splatter on the wall after shooting) 3. Leave the corpses and blood to exist in the map until it ends.  4. Make the weapon attachments visible. 5. Add weapon skins. 6. Add facial accessories. 7. Add ranked mode and awards. (!) 8. Make the bullets physics-friendly and let em fall further they fly.  9. Make more overall loot.  10. Change the lvl 2 backpacks color into the lvl 3 one, and make the lvl 3 black.   After these just improve the overall graphic and gameplay quality of the existent codes and cgi",
        "This game needs some serious work. Controls are hard, guns need rebalancing...tell me how, without getting a headshot, does an m14 beat a scar from short range? I was pelting this geezer w bullets hitting most but still get killed. 1 because the controls are stodgy and 2 because balancing is clearly an issue"

        "I've been playing candy crush for close to 4 years. Today I'm on level 3139. For the very first time I got the jackpot on the daily booster wheel. Thought it was impossible to get. Have read other comments saying no jackpot ever. Well today is a first for this challenging, sometimes very frustrating game. I play every day just to keep up with the free boosters. It's a free game that is fun.",
        "It's a very lovely game with nice graphics and I love the challenge and the difficulty, it helps you to think and make good choices but I don't understand why I will have to buy the gold bars that I earned playing the game. That's not just right. There should be options to buy additional gold bars not telling me my gold bars is filled and I need money to get it",
        "It's really addictive,like I'm a Sugar Crush- aholic :-)  But..... I had collected 60  gold bars and I couldn't get them unless I paid 2.99. So I wasn't to impressed by that. But nevertheless it's a great game so keep up the good work. Two thumb's up for me",
        "It keeps telling me my \"gold bars are full\" when I do well, but wants real cash when I try to use them. I refuse to spend real cash on an online....but addictive as hell that I am tempted to! Advise...If you have the sliqhtest of addictive personality. Stay away....",
        "Not so keen on the  graphics, the actual sweets are OK,  but, the puppets etc are not so good. It can take ages, days in fact to win the super hard games if you don't,  like me, buy help, and the free help you have earned are used up in the first go. So it takes perseverance.  Good game.",
        "Gripes: 1. The option to skip Sugar Crush takes a LOT longer to come out than before. Should come out almost as soon as Sugar Crush starts. Big waste of time and battery life. 2. Decreasing # of moves/time in levels that are already difficult to start with making it virtually impossible to finish them without boosters. 3. There should be shortcuts to earlier levels for those of us who want to revisit them to get more stars/better scores. Becoming increasingly necessary as the total # of levels is approaching 3000."

Maybe add a toggle to gold your breathe in the future so that it doesn't sway?",
        "The MOST IMBALANCED PVP game I've EVER played. It took me 20+ shot (30+ seconds) to kill 1 man. He shot me once and I'm dead. At least group the players by ranks (or by gear rating) to make it fun. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a non-paying player to kill a paying player. The PVP mode is a slaughter zone for paying players. What a ROTTEN game.",
        "Listen developers, you guys should be honest to us, we download to play and for fun. But when we pass few levels we have to wait for upgrades, this game offer us such weapons which are out of our earning. This game should absolutely free, no premium, low cost upgrades, no boring ads . Either everyone will uninstall after 1 - 2 months. Guarantee",
        "This is a great game but the bottom line is the developers want you to spend money upgrading. You get along so far upgrading with coins, which can be earned. Then they want tokens, which you must buy, to go further. The deals on weapons that are offered are always just out of reach. You can earn diamonds watching videos but I would rather play a game than waste time watching stupid add so I can play a game. It was fun but no more. Deleting.",
        "After the update on 2nd Mar-18, Spec ops not loading. Game simply terminate itself while trying to load spec ops Level 16. Everything else is working fine. I'm stuck 😓😪 Update: now I can't play even Daily Mission😩😤",
        "It's a real fun game for shooting.  I am giving 3 stars because gears are very expensive. I have reached level 8 without buying anything because all my earnings are not enough to buy a decent gun. You want people to pay rather then buy through skill earned point. But still great game."

I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven't! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there's the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it's long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁",
        "This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous\"Candy Crush\" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can't seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can't stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.",
        "I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it's so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You're clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I'm only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.",
        "Amazing! the best game ever! I'm really addicted to it. I even completed all the changes. I would be happy if there are more. but even now its good! I also recorded myself playing because I would live to show this game up to the world and give a review. Really enjoy it and think it deserves to be spread out",
        "Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.",
        "It's a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I'm going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??"

        "Good game to pass your time. Upgrade costs and parts spawn rates are reasonable if you only use a few vehicles because it will take a long to yo max out everything. I think it will be better if league vs trophies distribution are reworked because its very easy yo reach legends. should give a higher win bonus at higher trophies i think to make it more competitive. And lastly, hackers should be deleted from leaderbord.. there are a few impossible timings on the board.",
        "I enjoy the game greatly. It's slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I'm not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game",
        "I love this game. Every game I've had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I've unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn't almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.",
        "If you don't want to give away free stuff from the chests, don't. But stop wasting my damn giving me these \"free\" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.",
        "Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it's called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.",
        "Enjoyed the 1st game but, game 2 is pocket book wrecker, you can only go as far as you can pay to go. Everything is 4 times $ higher than it was in the 1st game and advancement is much slower. Just not that exciting for what it now cost, will probably uninstall soon."

        "There is just to much to say about this brilliant, creative, and fun game! It keeps me busy while im bored and on a road trip! I saw an ad for this on instagram and decided to download it, and let me tell you I was not disappointed with the outcome. I've been seraching for games like this and I have finally come across such a fantastic game! The Fluffy charectors should be sold as toys because of their adorable look!",
        "It's casual, relaxing and fun. Super cute. And it has 2 huge pluses: first of all it feels rewarding since you actually have a realistic possibility of getting new fluffies; second, you don't have ads shoved in your face every 5 seconds, in fact you pretty much never see them.  Really great at the moment, hope it stays this way. Lots of respect to the Devs for staying away from annoying cash grab techniques.",
        "this game is adorable. the only thing i'm not quite sure about is the rainbow system; what does it do? how does it work? it would be great to have a page that explains the details to those of us who aren't great at working this stuff out. i'd also like to ask why there aren't plushies for these things??? they're so cute! i'd by tons of they were real. anyway, great game, and the little fluffy cubes are the sweetest things and i just want to hug them all.",
        "This game is amazing, a load of fun and very competitive with friends, unfortunately no multiplayer on it.Would love for more Fluffies in the future with different abilities. Also Fluffies you can unlock by doing certain challenges and other stuff. You can also create a level mode where you have challenging levels to complete for coins or Fluffies, and one last thing, you all should have a head to head mode to see who can last the longest going against each other. Those are just some suggestions that I think would make the game even better than it already is.",
        "I love Fluffy Fall so much!! It is SUPER kawaii, fun, fuzzy, and enjoyable. It takes up your time as you try to beat your highscore!! Mine is 45.  I am really hoping that it updates, because I want all the monthly gem stones to be in stone section. I think it would be cool to have my gem stone. And play as it.  Anyways, I really love the game, it is so amazing!! If you love kawaii and fun games, get Fluffy Fall!!! 😊💕",
        "This is so fun and cute! I love the cute little furries, Awesome graphics and simple BUT FUN gameplay. One down side is It's little glitchy while doing levels and maybe some Furries from TV, Disney, books ect.like for an example: Mickey mouse, Pikachu, Totoro ect....If you can fix this I'll rate  it 5 starts"

Good bye...your game sucks.",
        "I'm almost @ the end of level 4. There is no more races after. When are you adding more levels? Also Nitro should be more visible when being used. Rain stages are to noisy. Can hardly hear the bike engine & even after the race the rain noise still goes on",
        "The game is quite buggy bcoz whenever I play the first race after finishing the race the game crashes I thought its my phone's problem bt it occurs frequently that's why I m uninstalling the game. Resolve it quickly..."

        "I love this game! If you like chess and like to think you'll like this game no doubt! There are some ads but not so much that it makes me want to turn off my Wi-Fi. It has cute graphics and runs smooth. I just cant get enough. As far as scary no not scary a little like whoa they're gunna hit.. Oh wait phew how did they not hit? RGB keep up the good work with this game and all your other free stuff! You guys make great games for all ages!",
        "Enjoyable game with challenging levels. Pros: levels won't tie you up so much despite difficulty. Gameplay is quick due mostly easy adjustment of delivery paths. You can also employ logic to help resolve route possibilities. Game does have ads, but they're not pesky and don't make you wait. Cons: Package drop circle toggles can get in the way of route-adjustment, especially on levels with many drop toggles. Suggested remedy: change the toggle-action to long-press rather than on short-press, allowing short-press to be reserved for route changing",
        "Im not normally one for puzzle games but This game is great and addictive, haven't played a game quite like it. This game was done so well from the gameplay to graphics to controls, it is a really fluid experience and a great puzzle game, the new mechanics were introduced perfectly as I progressed and there was never a puzzle too easy or hard the level of difficulty increases and a good rate! Way To Go guys",
        "The first levels are okay but after that there's a huge difficulty gap, got really frustrating. Controls are really bad. How I'm supposed to know where I'm taking the truck if my finger is on top of it?",
        "I love this puzzle game to death. I can literally play it all day and never get tired. Thank you for the challenging ones, it gets my brain going and it makes the game more tense. I certainly am inlove with the music. Please put a soundtrack on youtube, I would love to listen to it !! Thank you creators of the game, I enjoy playing it so much, and I do hope that there's more.",
        "This is a phenomenal puzzle game. It provides you with an incredibly simple concept that eases the player into the game's mechanics and turns into some very devious puzzles later on. The ads are a bit intrusive, being the ones you could accidentally tap on trying to remove with larger hands (like mine), and unskippable video ads that reward you with in-game currency needed to unlock levels, but those are never necessary, and for less than 2 dollars you can remove them outright. All in all, this is a charming and brain-teasing puzzle game that's well worth your time."

It's cool an all but I think rolblox creaters should make it a little bit easier. I know I'm one person and can't really make a difference but I want to have fun and I know everybody wants to have fun 2. So rolblox creaters if your seeing this you should think about what I'm saying. Also people out I hope you don't think I'm beeing dramatic but I just want to have fun. It's not about money it's about having fun they even charge you to much money so I just want to have fun. DONT GET ME TWISTED I like the game but it gets to hard. I'm gonna end this with I just want to have fun.😏😏😏",

Other than that this is a great app. Different servers and the ability to make your own makes it were there is many weird servers. You can change your out fit and be creative. The only negative thing is that there's no swearing allowed but this is controlled by the system which it sometimes thinks some of the word are swear words when they are not.",

        "LOVE IT!! But the controls for mobiles are... you know \"horrible\" and the screen are so glitchy and when I jumped or walked its a little late... and all of the famous games, I cant even play it... when I play it, it will load, it will let me play just for a second and then the screen will go freeze, and then BOOM! It will return to roblox home... hopefully the controls for mobiles can be fix and some other stuff that needs to be fix ≈) TY for this wonderful game and I love it!!♥♥♥ (BTW my profile is \"cutekittyloverMia25\") &gt;.&lt;"

        "Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea",
        "Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.",
        "What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don't even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can't place anymore and you lose.",
        "Would like to sometimes when my score is really high get a second chance to redeem myself. Other wise I like the game - kills some time when needed👍",
        "This is very deceiving. It looks like it's Tetris, but it's not. The pieces don't come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it's not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.",
        "Love the game can't seem to put it down. Great time passes while you're waiting for your washing to dry at the laundromat, beats watching it spin around. Not happy with all the adds popping up after every game and sometimes in the middle of a game."

        "The graphics are good, the controls are immersive...dont feel bad about why i gave only 4 stars because once i played in the tournament mode and the guidelines of the opponent was pointing in a different direction while when he is hitting a ball, it is automatically going parralel towards a pocket. It happened only once; looked like the opponent was hacking the game. He was potting all of the balls like that, and there was also full network. If you can fix it, then the game can be improved.",
        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱",
        "\"Cusion shot on 8 ball\" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.",
        "Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It's also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing."

        "I like the concept so far. I always wanted to play Sims on the go; now I can. I wonder if this game simulates life accurately. You can't have a life sim game without being able to make your avatar a member of the LGBTQA community. This is why I like Second Life. It allows me to be me (gay and proud) and doesn't judge. Will definitely add five 🌟 s if this feature is added along with In-game events that allows you to pursue your chosen lifestyle.",
        "ANYONE WHO GIVES THIS GAME A LOW RATING NEEDS TO SIT DOWN . I love that u have more customization with face and body structure similar to the way you do on Sims 4. The graphics in general are nice. My favorite part is that it's online. I love being able to chat with other Sims users and add them n stuff. Also am glad its not in real time ... I hate having to wait hours on FreePlay to get stuff done. This game is best. Lovelovelove",
        "I was so excited that the game is finally released untill when i want to start the game, the game starts with just the opening EA and Maxis title and then the game close it self. Is this a bug? My phone works well with other heavy games but how it cannot run The Sims Mobile?? Please fix this and i will change my rating! I use Lenovo Vibe K5.",
        "So far so good. Its better than the Sims Freeplay. I'd love it more if it was more like the actual sims. Please change the way this game is. Make it to where we can cook, and choose our sims personality traits, have babies, die lol/legacies, go to work for 8 hrs and actually make a decent amount of simoleons, actually have freedom you know? The actual sims gameplay!!! I love the task list and how we do have to unlock new worlds and items, but it'll be more exciting to unlock stuff to me if this game was more like the original sims. If we had the opportunity to play all day non stop like the original sims, I believe everyone would enjoy the game more. Please make a change to the game and make it more like the actual sims!!!",
        "It's not everything I wanted, that's for sure. This is a great game and I really enjoy working aspect is fun. The rest is boring. Little customization for sim, cannot interect with others like I thought and have to level up to customize house which is sad. I wish we could start with a little more, even have to unlock our personality. Whats up with that? Overall this seems like a really good game but its not the sims I was expecting",
        "In short.. been waiting to see what this had to offer.  Not a bad game. Granted it is way Better than \"sims freeplay\" however I expected more from EA. It's a nice app. Gameplay is good. Graphics are better than I thought. The in app purchases are what will get you.  For me though the Sims pc is where it's still at, for me anyway nothing beats the PC Version either Sims 3 or 4 Both are very good.   But there's enough here to tickle anyone's fancy. Hats off to the devs on this mobile game version!"

        "I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it's the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",
        "I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you'll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha",
        "I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.",
        "I was confident to delete the app from my phone cos it says that the game will be saved on my fb acc. But only the highest score remained and the potion got back to 1. I was already at 56! Deym! Ayusin nyo buhay nyo! Sayang effort ko! Aba!",
        "Too much bombs. Like i have 16 zombies and they put 7 bombs in a row! How am i supposed to win if i cant jump that high with all those bombs in the way."

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "I'm highly addicted to this game. It's a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it's really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!",
        "Competitive game to play in a spare time frame. I play daily, only problem is the occasional Lag of the servers online where anything can happen. Clearing the cashe seems to help for a short time, but Lag is a huge component that I had to remove 1 star. Other then that design your worm and try to make it to #1.... Its not easy (unless you play AI)"

My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.",

It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who's better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn't seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don't think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot."

Contacted customer support they said since I didn't start a transfer code? I could get my base back. DO NOT UNINSTALL UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE EVERYTHING. DO NOT SPEND MONEY BECAUSE AT ANYTIME YOU CAN LOSE IT.  Support was great they fixed everything.",
        "Extremely fun, I had an old account and I was level 27. But I had to get a new phone and did data transfer in time. Now I gotta start all over... But it's still really fun. Just kinda mad that I can't get back to where I was.  Edit: I keep getting communication errors and haven't been able to do a mission all day. All my stamina, gone. I let it refill still couldn't finish a story mode even. I had a good connection too",
        "I only rated it a three because this game needs to fit my screen. I own a Galaxy S8 and to have a title such as Naruto published by Bandai not fit the screen is something I'd think they should fix right away so new players don't have this issue and leave the game. I love the gameplay a lot and the raiding part is fun, I just don't like not having a clue ifnI'm spending ryo or the in game currency.  Please fix this issue.",
        "It is one of the best game I've ever played on mobile. I have just one issue. In this update, the traps don't work properly as before. A person is standing on the trap position but does not get stuck/hit by that. It took alot of time to set those traps and with this new update, all goes into waste. Please fix that.",
        "Please help me to get my data back because my due date is on 10.3.2017 i cannot log in my data using the new phone with the data transfer.please help me fast my old account is level 41.i have log in once and cannot log in it again using the same password please do this fast... Thank you for the best naruto game in mobile...I hope you can reset the game by making the game log in using the id and password which is valid until 10.3.2017.",
        "It's very fun and addictive but there's a bug few and then. I lost my 50 shinobite while summoning just like that because it was stuck at the summon loading page and I didn't even receive any ninja cards. I hope you can fix it and also refund my 50 shinobite at the very least. 😭"

        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",
        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.",
        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.",
        "Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn't need to have the internet on. Don't know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now."

        "Very fun and addictive. But there are these ads that open up my internet browser when I'm playing. Also, beeping noise came from the app. I immediately pressed the home button and the beeping stopped, so I know it's the app making those noises. Please fix the ad issue in the next update. :)",
        "I really like playing the game, it's fun with all the different character mechanics, but after the last update there has been a huge increase in ads that take me away from the game and open up play store or chrome. It does this in the middle of a round, so obviously it screws up my gameplay. Makes me consider paying for no ads, but also makes me want to delete.",
        "An unbelievable amount of ads in an otherwise fun game.   Ads after every match and spam ads trying to open my web browser multiple times mid match, somtimes when I'm preparing my shot which completely ruins it. Such a shame the devs chose to ruin their own game because of greed. Sadly this is more common than not nowadays.",
        "Got some lag when playing pvp with random player. Oponent hp didn't decreased, even if i hit 'em. And also... Too many IN GAME ADS. (sometimes it's very annoying).",
        "I WANT to like this game. It's fun. The problem is the ads (I'm fine with ads. It's a free game) but mid game it randomly opens ads. I'm talking the kind that take you to a whole new window and tell you your phone is infected and won't let you go back without closing that tab. It screws up your shots and it's just NOT ok. Please fix this mess and I'll redownload and give the game a better review. Ads are one thing but when they make the game unplayable, I have to delete the game."

        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "This is definitely the best game I've downloaded! Can you please add some more weapon boxes all unlockable with one key? And put like guns and things in. Granny doesn't stay tranquilized long enough. BEST IDEA EVER!! Make it so there is a granny in the forest and go into another house with granny in.",
        "Thus is the best thing since sliced bread! 😂😂 Its the best horror app ive ever played.. It is so deep.. really deep. Ive found all the secrets in one day. And let me tell you, Granny has a serious problem with bear traps.. 😂😂 Please keep up the good work! I beg you to nake more games like this! I LOVE GRANNY LOL  😆😂😍😗",
        "This is an early game with a bunch of potential. I love the game and I'm always playing it but I feel like you can expand the game with these additions. Firstly, why not add in a collectible menu where you can hunt extremely hard-to-find collection of items within Granny's house. Also you could possibly add another, backdoor exit to the house. This would mean being able to escape a different way. Finally you could add another whole game mode where you escape the house in a different way. (You could even add in a whole new mechanic but don't make it too complex!)"

        "Great game but all my progress was reset after playing for about 4 years. Waste of time to start again, I have heard many others which have suffered similar issues. Fix it.",
        "Awesome",
        "If you've liked the first game you're probably gonna enjoy this one. It's more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it's built around microtransactions so if you're feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don't understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it's likely you're going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.",
        "Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren't aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don't expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!",
        "Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I'm done, and become impossible. I'd love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It's a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it's a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.",
        "I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks"

This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "I don't know what the game is even like. I couldn't even get past the loading part because it won't let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won't play this game any further as its a waste of your time.",
        "The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game."

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.",
        "Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it's a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid"

Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move.

But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤",

If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.",

About the ads, they should be removed. Anyway, its a great game. The graphics is fine,and personally if someone wants to download it, I would advice yes.!",

Is there anyway for you AOV team to make a server for all SouthEastAsia so many will all be happy... sorry for any inconvenience caused.. appreciate for you team to try your best. Without you guys we work get to experience such good gameplay. Thank you 🤗😘",
        "Please fixed thst forcee closed issue . Deducting me for being afk during that game. Please do it admin o r i will not change my rating. I love this game so much from the start.  IGN: GrimKiller Phone: ASUS ZENFONE 4 SELFIE PRO SPECS: 4GB RAM 64 ROM  IN THAT SPECS I DONT IT WILL CRUSHED  I NEED COMPENSASION FOR THIS ISSUE",
        "This game is awesome! And more importantly, it's waaaay better than the cancer graphics of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. This game needs strategy and teamwork, unlike MLBB, it's a very easy game that doesn't require brains. MLBB has a lot of cancer players, trashtalkers, and stupid players. Although, you can never remove those kind of players but at least they stay in MLBB, and smarter people plays this. This is the best MOBA on smartphones! Kudos!",
        "update I wonder why game app like R.O.S and this moba AOV need a huge update. Please make this game using abit amount of size from before & please make game more balance. Player with low connection please dont make them didn't join any rank match or what.. they always make our game really bad",
        "Better than ML. Honestly, I play all sorts of Moba (or any video game), but this one really is different.  This game has issues, no argument with that. But when you compare it to \"Mobile Legends: Bang Bang\", you really see the difference. This one has top-notch graphics that I can probably compare to VG or PC Mobas. This game has awesome gameplay as well. There are almost overpowered heroes, but there are always heroes that counter them. ML looks like sht compared to this game.  The only downside that I can see is that, the controls are kinda off. Probably with an update, they can fix that. Will give five stars once that happens.",
        "I seriously love this game and got me hooked to MOBA games. One quirk though, I got the skin for Astrid which looks like Arthuria from Fate Stay Night. One suggestion is to make her sword glow gold instead of red to make it match more to Arthuria (Saber). Thanks! Keep up the good work!"

EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",

This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦",
        "This game is upsetting I have paid for players there are days when I cant win with a 90 overall. The computer kills me I stopped playing because its not fun to watch the AI kill you and your paying to support promotions. If you could tell the AI this is supposed to be a relief or escape not the reason why your upset at work. Bad Game with good potential"

        "I'm really enjoying this game. It beats the previous bid wars-storage auctions & pawn shop game I've played. Could you please add the opinion to change the cash to English pounds (£) and the chance to open more lockers and better chances on getting rare items. And tell us which cities we could find certain items we need to have in storage to complete missions.",
        "My game is literally unplayable right now. For about a week now, it has randomly just lagged out and would take 5 seconds for every action to actually take place. Now, when i boot up the game, it just freezes when i click on anything. My shop tries to open but just goes to a black screen and freezes. I will try to play for a few more days, but if i cant play by the end of the weekend, i will be deleting the game.",
        "Have a problem, mutt's semi legal store thing won't work. The black screen to show the result thing shows up top left corner, but it's just stuck there. And the rest of the screen shows the normal background for mutt's semi legal store, and I pretty much can't do anything when this happens. I have to reset the game, and each time I try to \"show results\" in mutt's semi legal store, same thing happens. Please fix this",
        "Nice game, but the downside is that you have very little time to see what you find behind the door before bidding starts. 5 seconds is not enough at all. And energy rebuilds sooooo slow. And then comes the high prices. If you don't invest real money in this game, there is a high chance you'll get bored cause you make little progress and it takes a lot of time. I know it is supposr to simulate rral life, but that is all forgotten once you \"swipe\" your real card... And how do i even know how much to pay for an item a client brings if i have NO IDEA of it's value. You think that's how real world works?",
        "What is wrong with the newest update? I can't acquire my item from the switch shop. Every time I click on get item, the black screen goes to the top left of the screen. And I can see the normal background picture. When that happens I have to close the game and reset. I've tried to get the item 20 times and it does that every time.",
        "Energy regen is far too low for a game where every auction is a potential loss. Shortly after the game asks you to review your opponents get far more aggressive on bids. You may have to walk away empty handed, forcing long wait times or for you to pay. Being able to play a game is the most important thing in a game and this one locks you out too often."

But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don't play this game  you'll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase",

High level players basically teleport in, raid everyone and teleport out.  They should lock servers to keep it balanced and give more guidance for new players. This game is  clearly weighted towards the people who have been playing it the longest. Dont waste your time",

Kingdom 277 is opened before 15 days back but one guild K03 got more powerful. Top guys got 120M might in just 15 days. Does IGG employees playing this game. We are lover of this game please don't lose your credibility. This two kingdom which I observed only Chinese players are strong. How overall kingdom only Chinese players got higher might in less time."

        "I gave it three stars because not too far along in the game, it turns into a \"pay to win\" game. Some boards simply don't give you enough moves, so you're forced to use coins to continue or retry and lose a life.  I don't mind hard games, but I detest micro transactions being needed so soon into it.. I'm at level 24, that's it, and already the board doesn't even give you a fighting chance to beat it without using coins.",
        "Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it's going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!",
        "Its a nice game! But it just takes forever to open a new level. Sometimes your on one for days. That's just to long. That's why I pay farm inland. You can play for hours with out bring stopped no lives. . I want a game that's fun and relaxing. No hard or extra hard ones. I really like cleaning and fixing thing. Be nice if you could do more area and less puzzle.",
        "I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don't like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",
        "This game is awesome. But the stars, please increase the amount of star not just 1. Make it 2 for the Hard Level. And lastly, it's hard to download new rooms when it always appear the Technical Error. Better if you do not require to download it and the user can open it without connecting to internet. However, the game is great for relaxing. Keep up the good work!",
        "Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought \"Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements.\" but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)"

You can play on both your desktop and mobile interchangeably with the same account!  Developers are very much a part of the community; constantly improving the game and running in-game events.  While there are in-app purchases I never feel pressured... I spent a few $ because I wanted to support the game as I've been enjoying it throughly.",

You can play in multiple worlds, join guilds, make friends and they have great quests to do if you choose to.",

        "It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn't cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.",
        "Very annoying problem with Google Play account disconnections at task swap. Fix this, and I will be able to actually play the game. Since I use my phone for making real income, I need to swap screens to other activities, and each time do a four step log in process back into the game. I have never seen this problem before in any other game, no reason this game would be different. Unfortunatly the problem seem to become worse, I would not spend money on this game, too shaky account control. Will uninstall it now and go shopping for something more reliable. A shame as the game itself is really neat."

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "I really like the game I play it every single day and im not that much of a gamer. Im actaully at level 82 and cannot go further cause im waiting for more missions. Lol So please send more missions.😁 plus i love the sarcasm between the two of them😂keep it up!",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges."

        "If you love using your hard earned money for virtual play this is the game for you. What starts out with gems being a few at low amts as you advance the gem amt grows ridiculously outrageous. Move on because this game will break your bank account quickly.",
        "The ga,e is pretty fun and addicting, but it's a cash grab. It's ridiculous to require gems for upgrades which allows you to advance in the game. The free gems given are few and far between which forces the gamer to either give up playing or buy gems. I won't pay for gems. I'll stop playing instead. Thanks for the 15 minutes of fun.",
        "Cute to see yall deleted my last review. Re writing and giving you 1 star.  Game crashes constantly. . Can no longer get into.  No more money will be spent till fixed. And if my review is removed again. I will just uninstall",
        "I love this game. But when I go into the free gem section and complete an offer it doesn't give me my gems. It took me 2 days to get to level 8 on a game because that is what the offer said. I still have not received any gems. I've also done quite a few others and no gems from those either.",
        "You can't proceed without gems once you unlock the second area. Pretty sad, because the game has potential. Hate to see greed override balance. You should be able to grind in a game like this and proceed... Not get stuck because you choose not to spend excessive amounts of cash."

It's a nice app but I might uninstall it because I can't play it all the time!",

The game was fun to play until that the tasks had been getting ridiculous that even I was playing with the highest speed I still won't make it on time or I won't even get as many costumers as the tasks said so, and not only that I've been playing extra job levels and guess what? I'm not gaining any gems"

        "Do not waste your money on the game. I use to enjoy it and had no problem paying for things. I believe a company should make money if they do their job. Since it was sold to a new owner they no longer answer anyone's questions. They send you to a link that has everyone else scrambling for answers. They also do not replace items you lose when the game has problems. They do not care if you purchased them. The old company use to replace items and gold bars when it was the games glitches. They actually cared about the people playing it. The owners now can not even be bothered to reply. If you play it only get the free stuff. Do not waste your hard earned money on this game. They will not spend any time to make sure you get what you paid for",
        "Why did bubblegum hill disappear in the middle of the day today? Also the power ups are not staying the allotted amount of time either? I've spent money on this app but won't spend anymore!",
        "The game is fun, but customer support is terrible. I've had a number of issues with booster bonuses - infinite boosters are activated for 2 hours or more, but after a short time they vanish. I get no reasonable response, nor effort to make up for lost items, from support team.",
        "Stuck at level 705 no more levels available? Everytime I load the app it tells me I'm not connected and to go online to download more episodes, I'm obviously connected on my device or I wouldn't be here.(update) Stuck back at level 705 again can't get past it to the level I'm actually at so annoyed, it's now been 20 plus days of this issue can't even play the game unless I want to play levels I've already done what is going on fix this already!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yet another update and still the same issue, it's been a month or longer starting to think this won't be fixed total bs",
        "theres a message saying cannot connect, download episodes...again. So I updated the app and it put me back to lvl 705 or something. Can you fix please?? I will give 5 stars. I was at level 1200 or so I think",
        "Great game, however with the last update it will not let me move past level 705 even though I am on a level in the 1400's. It keeps saying it cannot connect and that I need to go online to update episodes."

        "I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what's the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?",
        "i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.",
        "Winnings suck. Instructions are very vague. Way too many ads. Feel like in order to play you have to pay in order accomplish levels and continue story campaign. Sorry guys but I bet my criticism has been said over and over again. Result is boredom. Too many other games to waste my time playing. Need to fix these if you wish to keep this game on the market people!!!!",
        "I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don't change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don't get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn't have done that then I would be impressed by the game.",
        "Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.",
        "The is the most intense game ever.When you think you've got it ,it's gone. Can't figure out how to boost. Controls aren't the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it's fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can't back out of the ad."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

        "i could have give 5 star on this game if only the supports are replying on my email. the game is great but not player friendly. i emailed so many times on ingame support but no reply till now. if you would mind to check, some asian server doesn't have timed event tab. players who recharge and consume their diamonds didn't get any corresponding rewards. please check server a-s101 for your information thanks.",
        "So I am a major mobile gamer.  And I must say this game is awesome in a number of ways. My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on \"finish daily or unfurnished daily\", I can't seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.",
        "Its a good game. One of the nicest mmorpg on the market right now. However, my only nitpick is the lack of customization of the characters. You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn't change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.",
        "Nice game. But player's cant level up more. I get vip for this game but it sucks! So hard to level up what's wrong with you guys. How players will enjoy this game! No A.P and lots of problem so when the players no gems to buy your AP we exit. What will you do guys. When the players are gone? You will revise the game play to get more exp. Try it then you will see guys no more players in this game! Fix it not for me! For use who play this game and I think many players will enjoy in haunting items level up and more vip players will come. Hope to read this guys!",
        "Man I gotta write this again &gt;~&lt;... The only thing u need to fix is the bug that doesn't allows you to see the characters... It really anoys me b/c I'm a girl and only the boy characters are visible so please fix tgis in the next game update! That's the only bug that I have experienced! Anyways everyother thing is *AWESOME* btw my character is the puppeteer if that helps in something",
        "This is actually a very good mmorpg game, i'd like to say it's the best mmorpg, but, the bug isn't fixed yet, i can't see my character when playin, also the puppeter and bountu hunter. Fix this bug quickly, i want to play this game so bad. I can't enjoy the gameplay if the characters are invisible."

After the update if i play too fast or sometimes just randomly, the sound cuts out on some taps, very annoying when you're trying to keep a beat. What happened!?",
        "3 stars with note! I copied my review for Classic Drum to be used as review for this app &gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes lag occured during play. Sensitivity needs improvement. Need manual placement for all kits. I am left handed. This default kits layout is not a joy. Distance between toms, snare and kick need a bit space. Also need space for the hi hat and tambourine. Sound is okay. I used both of these apps.",
        "I'm never one to comment but this is fantastic!  I needed a few  percussion samples and thought I'd give an app a try..  I wasn't very optimistic on getting something realistic and easy to use. Was I wrong... I'm totally satisfied with this app and then some!",
        "Very good app for great time pass!But some time pass is the way of earning money and fame! There is an YOUTUBER named \"Mobile drummer\" from india,uploads video on youtube with the help of this app and earns a lot ,his some videos are 1 million crossed .",
        "This application was filled with unecessary and nerve-warcking advertisements. I do not recommend this app to anyone, and if you are interesting in drumming, just buy a real or electric kit rather than playing this garbage.",

I am convinced your company has no financial, software OR marketing epertise. Lmao get ur old jobs if u can.",
        "This is for the makers of this game you need to introduce rules so that players who either work for the makers or spend 100's to become strong very quickly... cannot destroy the enjoyment of the game for those of us who would like to grow in the game and play the game properly to become strong through perseverance and hard work... the cash rich players are ruining this game for everyone...",
        "I love this game, good strategy and quite time consuming. Wish they would fix the glitches of it lagging out on world map and regular \"initialization failure\" when trying to switch accounts. Now, with this new update, i cant even play anymore; it just freezes up during the loading page...",
        "Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.",
        "A giant mess of people who pay a ton of money to prey on anyone with impunity. Absolutely no rules regarding who or how often you can attack someone significantly lower in level. Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.",
        "You guys really need to do some balancing. It's ridiculous that a level 22 guy can just annihilate me when I'm level 10. Its pretty blatant that you're trying to force us to pay to play. You should make it to where you can only attack X levels below you and the further down you go, the less loot/xp you get, if you attack even or higher you get bonus loot/xp. Good game but needs rebalancing asap or your game will slowly die."

Can you do something to fix this problem. I love the quality of music and the gameplay but there are issues that need to be fixed. Thank you in advance.",

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "Well I like the game. It's fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don't open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.",
        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don't disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess..."

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it's pretty much an insta-win. I don't know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn't, you should probably put some spikes there or something.",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero."

        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Let me just say I don't mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "Way to many adds. I've never had this problem until today but the ads are even popping up DURING a fight and COMPLETELY blocks the WHOLE screen. VERY annoying. Another major problem is you can't turn off the push notifications. ALSO, very annoying.",
        "I have been searching for a game that suits me and i just found it SF2 is on my top three list of martial arts games. But there's a problem, your opponents who r not shadows are shadows so please change that. And could u add a multiplaer mode. Anyways good game"

You bring all these amazing features but you take away the most important feature in any shooting game: walking around and taking cover where you like.",

Often going back to previous levels needing three stars for best advantage. Only problem I have is with cloud save I can't log in successfully and you must exit game to save data to your phone leave any other way all current data is gone. lOVE the game Good job.",

        "You'll know right away if the game is bad just by reading the dialogues. If the English is bad, chances are the game is bad too. I have proven this many times already, and I know many other players have too.",

I bet this game would be a lot more fun if you could walk around instead of just sitting In one place which is my only complaint. But otherwise overall this game is rather a bit fun if you are looking for a time killer.",

        "I'm really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don't have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!",
        "This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don't think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it's free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.",
        "To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I'd like. You can't at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I'd like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn't taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it's worth the $1.99 purchase I made.",
        "This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don't really care either way I'll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I'd debating on installing it just get it. You'll have fun, trust me.",
        "Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.",
        "This game is absolutely amazing, but I have some gripes with this.  1. The game constantly lags very badly, even in the lowest graphics quality and occasionally freezes, costing me races. 2. Sometimes when I slide in one direction, it goes a completely different direction and screws up my gameplay.  3. Sometimes, the connection gets lost for an unknown reason and I still lose trophies for it. Can you fix these problems, especially the 1st one?"

Only suggestion would be that the bonus hours of unlimited lives could be gameplay hours, not actual time hours as it is sometimes impossible to continue playing depending on when you are awarded the bonus but on the plus side there are many opportunities to get bonus hours or recharges, much more than many other games.",

        "Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it's better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.",
        "WTH HAS HAPPENED?? Been playing for 3+ years and have NOT EVER seen the game \"rolling\" system so broken. I have not rolled anything worth a $$@ in almost 3 MONTHS. Don't give me the it's random thing. I have never had anything like this until after an update a couple months back. You have obviously changed the system and it is apparently to screw the long timers in favor of generating more $$ but it's only making long timers like me BORED and frustrated!! I'm not spending any more money until it's fixed. Tired of wasting cash!",
        "I've been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.",
        "Some people use this for a dating app or say innapropiate things and kids play this game obviously. But that isnt the games fault its the players fault. However i would like it if the creators would sensor all of that",
        "OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don't get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits",
        "Lol I'm changing my review once more. I love the game but every new hero you guys drop completely messes up the game and makes things unfair. I don't know if your way of trying to fix it is by making more OP heroes but it simply makes the game less enjoyable. The last few heroes that came out completely made my account useless and if I don't put in a good couple hundred dollars is just gonna stay useless. I think that's unfair so for now I'm taking off a few stars. I know you guys don't care but its the only thing I can do to express my opinion. In my humble opinion you guys should balance the useless heroes you already have rather than coming up with new ones that make the old ones  useless."

        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.",
        "I really like this game. But here is why I gave it 2 stars.  I completed all of the challenges but still don't have have enough score to finish ranking up.  The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don't think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes..."

        "It's a good cover-based shooter, with some pretty creative characters and a good pace for quick battles. The unlock system is more than fair, with the ability to save currencies for that one big purchase. I enjoy the ability to play at my own pace without sacrificing my life to the game (cough*Kabam*cough) and I'm having a lot of fun. I've noticed that PVP tends to favor Savage, when he activates Spray and Pray once, half the opposing team dies. Twice, and the round is over. Otherwise a very well done and enjoyable game.",
        "Fun game, good time killer, great graphics. Unfortunately,  like with many other games, they sucker you in with rewards at the start only for you to soon hit a paywall. It's  either grind and hope you get lucky or give into the many game ads promoting cash purchases. Anything involving actual online play (co-op, PvP etc) seems to freeze or have crazy lag. I'm not a fan of the game opening apps, especially when all it says is \"watch a video\". Good game, definitely has room for improvement.",
        "I really enjoy the action this game brings along with good looks and simple controls. Too many times development teams get caught up in the visuals or complex control schemes and forget about what gamers really love and that's not having a complex control panel with nice smooth transition from level to level. Thank you for making this game a joy to play every time I turn it on.",
        "Awesome game absolutely loving it. Keep the daily events coming - without them there wouldn't be enough incentive to play every day and there wouldn't be enough stamina. My main recommendation is consider introducing upgrading equipment e.g. 10 bronze fuel cells give you 1 silver fuel cell. Also consider lowering the cost of stamina refill to say maybe 20 gold. Cheers",
        "The game is awesome. But my galaxy core prime freezes every time I play a co-op mission even when closing the app and opening it again it will try to reconnect, once it's reconnected it will freeze again. I know you worked so hard on this game but please fix this.",
        "Nice game ...the only problem  I say would be its pay to win philosophy. Yeah it's easy in the beginning but the gear gets really scarce to if your really trying to win it'll be next to impossible to do so with out swiping that good 'ol debit card. Otherwise it's a fun and awesome game. That is in the beginning...."

        "Easily my favourite android game. Hits all the right spots. While Blitz followed the runner style coins model and see how much you can travel, I am glad that in this game they ditched that over-used android model. I appreciate there vision, it's a complete different game from Blitz. Various fictional cars and characters that seem original inspirations and charming in their own way. The tracks have a theme. Boss races under every championship. There is so much of soul in the game. And you can adjust resolution, add colour correction, adjust many other effects. Words don't do justice here nor does 5/5.",
        "Amazing! I play this game daily and I never got bored. Just one thing: other drivers don't use special abilities which does not makes it challenging. Now since I have completed this game once, I would expect devs to add new levels and characters. I have an idea for a new character. Please contact me if I can help you",
        "exciting game for sure. but unfortunately i can't play it via bluetooth directly to other device without connecting to android tv. one more thing, i suggest to add on screen joystick for control option. im really looking forward for developer to update this. thank you",
        "The game just restarted as if I never played it. Just went through the tutorial as a new player. I have been playing for months. Not sure what happened! Can't sync it with google games. I do know I was playing and mid game my phone battery died. I recharged it and went to the game and went default on me.",
        "The controls take some getting used to. But for a Mario-Kart-like experience for mobile, this game gets my #1 rating. Feels more like Diddy Kong racing to be honest though. Can be played when you only have enough a few minutes, or grinded for awhile until you run out of tickets.",
        "MAYBE U SHOULD WORRY ABOUT \"PLAYABILITY\" RATHER THAN \"PAYABILITY\". YOUR GAME STILLS CRASHES, RESETS AND JUST STOPS FOR NO REASON BUT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT, JUST YOUR BOTTOM LINE. MY BOTTOM LINE ? YOUR APPS ARE GARBAGE."

Various updates regularly break it. The option is there, but it keeps giving a generic error message. It isn't my SD card, I have a genuine 64GB Samsung Evo Plus. It is definitely the app itself causing the issue, as I could transfer the previous versions fine. And especially as every single other app with the option to move to SD works fine. This is the only app on my phone with this feature that it intermittently doesn't work.",

People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4.",
        "Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts"

And then there is that stupid ad bar at the bottom. When I slide across the screen, sometimes my finger goes down, right on the ad. Yay? I think not. Why do you think this game is rated a 3.8?",
        "I love the game but I paid to remove the adds and guess what I still am getting littered with adds that is complete b.s. I want my money back. Paying for no adds and still getting adds. I could and should bring a civil court law suit up over this either fix the problem or refund my money.",
        "God I hate the voodoo developers, they come up with cool game ideas but then just litter the game with ads and ruin it.. I understand some ads but god damn theres an and every 30 seconds.",
        "JUST AWFUL!!! The whole thing stinks. Not because of the app asking me for my card before downloading it, not because of thing being riddled with ads and especially not because of the fact that this is like all the other run if the mill apps that many will play for a bit or so and just get borde and never play it agian; or just out-right uninstaling it. It is all because of one simple reason. The missed opportunity of bounceing on my boi while playing this. I mean, I just can't play this stupid game and bounce on my boi at the same time! I mean are trying to exclude the people who want to bang and play a game at the same time? And you can't do that to us. In fact It all makes me think that you guys are rasist, homophobic and white privileged fascist. And all of that just don't seem right to me, just like 9/11.",
        "I always play games with music in the background and while playing this game my music would be constantly shut off because of the ads, I don't mind the ads themselves, just the fact that it constantly interrupts other sounds playing on the system is very irritating. Gave you 2 stars for a nice game, didn't play a lot though so couldn't tell you more.",
        "Don't bother downloading. Asks loads of permissions that it doesn't require on install. Game would be OK but as others have said the developers have shot themselves in the foot by showing locked ads even when u don't choose to continue. VOODOO take notice of the reviews, less ads will make you more money in the long run cos like me, people just uninstall!!"

If the actual price is what I am being charged, then please display that price in the game. I can share snapshot if required. Thanks.",

        "Awesome game!! Needs to be a bit easier to gain/find/aquire chest keys and cosumables to evolve. As is now ..the process of evolution of player/weapons/armor gets a bit dragged out and a bit confusing... Either way I love the game concidering Im not into role playing ones... Please ..if you (the developers...a.k.a. Masterminds of this game) are updating/upgrading this game..it works out much better to be more action less RPG.",
        "After the new update the game is unplayable sometimes. I get nothing for some succesfully completed missions or fortress attacks, the controls are worse than in the previous version, the attacks don't always go as I aim them. When I click on the promotion ads, there are no promotions, not to mention that I have to restart the game from 10 to 10 min for all the features to work like upgrades to weapons and troops. This game is full of bugs and the new update should've fixed some of them but instead there are even more bugs. I am very disappointed and the customer support is also weak...",
        "TERRIBLE customer service, guys- I've been waiting 2 weeks for someone to get back to me.  I got demoted from level 14 master 2 to level 12 in one single PVP battle. What? I recently gave you a glowing review but this is not good. I tried signing up for a customer account to talk to your team and my email is not accepted. Please fix this and I will happily rewrite my review."

        "This game is highly addictive. The challenges are hard but not impossible. You need patience...and planning. The Chinese new year's event made me used to the shortened energy usage, now that it's back to normal, just doesn't seem to be enough. But maybe that's where the patience comes in. Great game overall, really enjoying it. However finding copper is near impossible on any maps, but it's needed for a bigger backpack and what not.. this is a real pain in the proverbial but..",
        "This game is very well made and a lot of fun. The graphics and controls are great and there are tons of items. The reason I only give it 3 stars is because to progress you need to build a chopper and you have to buy packs to get even a chance of getting many of the parts needed. Without it you simply cannot explore further. Seems like a very greedy way to set up the game. I've already spent money trying to get the parts and I'm nowhere close to being able to finish. Please add better loot and parts to the actual game instead of the store.",
        "Love the game but it takes SOO long to progress anywhere. Plus I think there should be more 'events' popping up to keep it interesting and exciting. It gets a bit boring clearing the same forests and alpha bunker time and time and time again.... Other than that I do enjoy it. Have never had any issues with the updates either just thought I'd add.",
        "This game is very fun and addictive! I got right into it as soon as i started to play. The only thing i would recommend is changing the price of the chests. I feel you would get alot more revenue if they were marked down. The game is going to be alot better when you open it up multi-player. Can't wait for clans.",
        "Excellent game, but every single update comes with a glitch to my base.This time it seems that anyone could open my chest from outside a level 3 wall without breaking the wall. This is great for the raiders but not for me... hope they fix this bug,. Before I go raiding and loose  a lot of stuff.",
        "The game is awesome! But collecting stuff like engine part , wrench,bolts are a huge headache . What do we need 20 engine part for building chopper [Bike] ????? Atleast be realistic. Soon i will be buying iphone so add a feature where i can link my android account to ios bcoz i got a progress of last 6 months and i don't wanna loose it.........."

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",

I felt like never deleting  it even i have completed this game . I understood this game by pressing the help button.  I have become  an expert in this without any friends. I have the hulk friend only but i use it rarely.because of playing alone I am stuck in level 19 but i will try. If not possible I wl use hulk. Thank u veryyyyyyyyyyyyyy much!!!!!!☺☺😊😃.i just have a question to you that when can my player become hulk. Only when we buy game money or any other way?????😞😐please tell fast",

        "So far I've been enjoying it. It's nothing too special, typical mobile fighting game but Tekken. The fact that's it Tekken makes it more enjoyable than average because I love Tekken, but that's just me. I feel that acquiring new characters needs to be way easier than it is, especially when you need to take on harder missions for bonus materials and currency. I don't like how you have to wait for characters health to regenerate. If characters healths auto filled per mission, I would definitely put more time into the game. Since it isn't, I have to constantly stop playing and wait for the health to refill, and I don't wait to use healing items because it takes away from my in game currency, which itself is difficult to obtain if you aren't constantly grinding. Aside from that, it's fun. Very fun, I recommend.",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "This game is beautiful! I have always loved Tekken ever since the 1st and have played them all. I only wish some of my favorite characters weren't missing, like Lei and Bryan and I haven't seen Yoshimitsu or Heihachi Mishima. Overall I am very impressed. Thanks, I have been waiting for this on Android for a long time! I would rate 4.5 stars ☺",
        "Am I ever going to play this game?  All it does is download stuff Update:. Graphics are great, game play is ok, seems like I'm just hitting random parts of my screen.  Healing component is going to make me uninstall.  There's no area to practice to figure out what you're actually doing."

        "Love, love, love Gamehouse games! Every games I've played so far had a great storyline, graphics are outstanding & the game never gets boring as I replay them over and over! My only complaint would be u can only go mainly to level 10 on most! Hearts medicine let's you play all 60!",
        "I've bought all the past delicious Emily games and never had a problem. I've bought thus version and am having problems. The games sticks alot. Bit I've played first world lvl 6 successfully. However have not received the diamond. I have not burned or spilled anything, multiple times but cannot get my diamond. I know this seems minimal, but at the end in completing the backyard it will in fact be important. Please help",
        "Total waste of time! You expect me to pay to finish the game?! I think not... in fact you should be sued for false advertising! The game is listed as FREE... unless you don't understand what free is, it means PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY IT!",
        "This was one of the hardest Emily games...but the graphics were awesome and it's ones of the smoothest with least amount of bugs.  In that end I enjoyed it, but I will not get all the trophies. I LOATHE the \"add 5 friends\" trophy. I'm not going to do it this time. I just won't have all the trophies.",
        "Firstly I'd like to say buying the game at level 6 is really unprofessional!  It's a shame too, as I would of given a much better rating! I suggest that you put the option to pay at the beginning? The graphics are amazing just the game experience has made me put 1 star. Think about it or review the comments and the game, thanks."

And this is first time i'm very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven't sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!",

        "I can't stop playing this!! The missions are really hard and thats what makes it fun! although i almost threw my phone twice. but this game is amazing! the graphic is good too!",
        "Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.",
        "One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can't pass anywhere, even though there's nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there's no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too."

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!"

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I'm not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr",
        "Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I'm paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn't make it worth the price being asked.",
        "I'd say it's worth it even as a free game.  It's a fun game to kill time. Even if you run out of tickets there's many ways you can earn more on the free side. To purchase at 10 bucks the play becomes almost non stop. Good buy, good time killer, challenging, and overall enjoyable game, free or paid for.  5 stars from me.",
        "I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren't here. They don't connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw",
        "Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars",
        "Its good fun but extra world tour levels are needed to sell the full game, both after purcgase and before. But if you delve into the crevices of each mode and extract every bit of play you'll find out whether it's worth it"

Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I'm newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.",
        "Two words: unlikable ads. Adds pop up befnore you open the game, after at advertises itself, shows another ad, then you get to play, with an add at the bottom. And after your first touch you get another ad that is very difficult not to open. I should have known, it's made by ketchapp. Very unsatisfied. They make so much money and adds and put so many so they annoy you into paying them money for less adds. Greedy.",
        "Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.",
        "The game sucks it's alwful. It's gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!",
        "Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don't want a load of wasted time, don't download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.",
        "The game was amazing! There was only 1 problem. Sometimes when i  started a game in the middle of it, it would just show an ad and it would make me lose. Unless you fix this my rating will be 4 stars. Fix this and the rate will be 5 stars"

Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I'm thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven't even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that's all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.",
        "I like this game so much that i am addicted already, its just that, i don't have money to buy the original Geometry Dash, i want to try the original one, RobTop can u atleast make the original Geometry dash free for 1 day so that other people can try too? It would be great if that was like a celebration.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂"

        "Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don't even mind because it's still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!",
        "I love this game.  It's very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!",
        "There are so many good things to list about this game. First, the graphics are extordinarily beautiful. And how much this game can relax you is AMAZING! When I play this, I swear my stress is gone. This game is never stressful. I find it amazing how satisfying this game is. I also love how realistic this game it is. The veiw and echoing is what really make up this game. Every sound is perfect for the setting. You need to download this NOW!",
        "Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free."

        "This is one the best RPG phone games out. It is addictive and fun with lots to do at everyone point in the game. At the moment it is my favourite phone game. It is a bit complicated at the start, however you start to understand it more and more as you play. There is in game purchases but these are not necessary to enjoy the game. Definitely a 5* game! Only thing I find slightly annoying is that I never seem to have enough gold but this might change as I level up.",
        "MAKE SURE U READ THIS ALL. This game is truly one of the best I've played and one of the very few that IS NOT a pay to win. So much depth its great. But can also discourage some. Many things unlock further in. They give u game currency everyday, u can get any, I mean ANY item in game just by saving.Very easy and very fun. Just needs longer dungeons and ways for higher ups to get more gold faster. More and game content. But there's still so much to do anyways but people will always want more. Great game and good work. Those who'd think this is a paid comment, I sure wish it was ;)",
        "I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I'm data only) and my tablet says the game isn't compatible. It's marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it's not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I'm not running a speed test.",
        "Requires some patience but is a really fun game. Don't expect to fly through the tutorial but they make it fun learning the steps. What I enjoy the most, is its NOT lagging down my processor with ads. Only thing I wish is that the home base was a little more organized.",
        "I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..",
        "I'm playing this game long ago, maybe almost a year. I'm using facebook account to login.. why my character is gone? I have 3 character in the same account with different class, and when I login, just one left and it rollback into lv 9 without any equipment.. please explain, I have proof also.. thanks"

        "Now these days, to be powerful is cards. And it's really sad to see it in one of my favorite fighting game. I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it's still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I'm going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.",
        "The game is a lot of fun but there's one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it's kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I'd give it 10 stars",
        "I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn't too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can't sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?",
        "Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn't going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range",
        "Would be great if there were a better sign in feature. I had to restore factory settings on my phone... Now the game won't allow me to log into my account. Which sucks a lot, I have spent money on microtransactions and a bit of time into leveling up. But now that seems to be all gone...",
        "Poor game poor tech support. Tech supports says they get 1000s of issues everyday and can't support everyone. Then why they have to charge their customers when they can't offer proper support. Moreover they don't even bother to understand what customers are telling and don't know who their payment partner is either. Wonderful Nekki! Continue to serve with superior support in future and provide more reasons like the one you gave to me.. Hats off!"

I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.",

        "Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw \"pick 2\" vs. pick 3. I'm a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the \"typical pick 3 concept\"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper",

        "Not a clue if there's a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It's challenging but I've yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though \"buying lives\""

        "I'm reading their reviews on this game and I'm not sure why people think you have to use real money.. I recently upgraded my game due to the fact I made it to the second last level without having to put any real money into this game.. on the home screen you can use your coins to play a slot machine on which you can win free gems..i have won hundreds upon hundreds of gems over the past year I've played this game... I have not put any money into this game until today and really give the makers a pat in the back for making a user friendly game in which you don't have to buy stuff for the game to level up... I supported this game today because of that fact... for 3 dollars I am now add free.. I like to support those who are about making life easier on me as a mom and not out to drain every dollar I have... thank you to the makers of this game...",
        "I like it, very interesting.  But you need to spend real money and I was shocked that while upgrading the items you also need to spend gems and coins at the same time. At first I was confused why I always don't have gems knowing that I'm playing videos for extra 2 gems in rewards. Hmmm it's quite disappointment  and waste of time for advertisement to get a gem.  Just my thoughts 😊 GB❤",
        "The game itself is fine but I don't want to spend real money to advance. The only way I can get diamonds to upgrade my stuff is to buy them with real money. I feel like there should be a way to earn them in the game like the other cooking games.",
        "It's actually kind of relaxing. But you need to spend money early just to level up a machine once. I can see doing that later in the game, but right away? Nope.",
        "Was a little boring in the beginning, but now it's so challenging. Can't put my phone down, I'm addicted. And I love how they made it so easy to get diamonds.",
        "It's a very nice game but I don't know how to open the red envelopes anytime they give me or is it automatically opened.  Please clear my doubts and reply but apart from that it's a very nice game."

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",
        "Support is incredibly slow, they will happily take your money and not let you have access to the items you payed for. Will update this review if they ever actually resolve my issue. It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved",
        "I installed the game. I was enjoying it then suddenly it stoped working giving me an error message of \"license stoped working\". I uninstalled it and will try to install it. I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",
        "I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.",
        "Characters repeat the same thing over and over and it gets really irritating. And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

        "The game is really good. I'm really enjoying it but after playing for about 15 to 20 minutes it just quits, like it's crashing. This usually happens when I'm first place and level 17 or so. Really frustrating as it means I've gotta start again. Will happily increase to 5 stars once this has been resolved. Great game other than that!",
        "I personally love this game. The controls are fluent, and it is all around a good game. 😀 But, for some reason, whenever I go into the battle Royal game, it just instantly kills me! Sometimes it works, but most of the time it just kills me straight away. Maybe it's me... Idk other than that, great game!",
        "4 or 5 games have got me to spend money in years of playing Android games. This is one of them. Probably because they didn't force me to, to enjoy the game. Great work. Different game modes keep it fresh. Very addictive. Please update and fix the English though.",
        "I absolutely love this game BUT it continually crashes. What's worse is when I'm top player in the arena and are maxxed out, only for it to crash for no reason. I always play using my home Wi-Fi, which is 60mbps on a Samsung S8 Plus. Everything on the phone is updated and I rarely have more than 3 or 4 apps open in the background. Guys, PLEASE fix this crash issue. I effin love this game but it's very unplayable.",
        "Gameplay is awesome. Game is awesome. Game is also buggy as hell. Bad translations, poor perk descriptions, and even perks that break functionality with certain game modes.  Worst thing is the inability to do almost anything while office or in low service areas absolutely maddening. Constant disconnect while playing online games.",
        "Ranked is bugged and u sometimes spawn outside. no health and exp drops too. Game is completely messed up since the last patch? Plus u will only play in ranked matches with ppl who are on the same rank as u. not enough playerbase makes u sometimes wait long/ impossible to play ranked. they should allow matchups with +-2 or 3 of ur rank"

        "The game is very well written for offline, but not for online games. My phone becomes slow and slow after playing online. During play I experienced slow and my mobile internet speed drops slowly from 55mbps to less than 1 Mbps speed, although I have very good internet speed in my home. After factory reset my phone comes to normal. No problem during offline. I would give rating 5 if it has robust encryption and hack proof.",
        "This game need serious adjusments in controls specialy u cannot aim firmly and direct instead you end hitting the opponents balls instead of yours. Lack of aiming assistance like in 8 ball pool and the power bar should be located in the left side more comfortable to me . How i wished you can configure that by yourself but no option for it available. In the other hand the game is playable not fun at all but playable . Let's see if u update this features soon. I'm delete it until all this bugs are fixed cheers all.",

Can u do me a favour please link this game to email or facebook id because whenever i want to change my cellphone  then the game starts from starting point please do something when anyone cange his cell phone then the game starts at that point or level where i left  please",
        "Due to it's server problems some times it's not responding in online. when our turn comes it gets timed out and opponent get 2 chances at a time eventually we loose the game developers need to check this seriously.",
        "Being a user of this app for over 2 years running, i must say that this is the best pool game i had come across. The controls r just so perfect. No annoying adds... Awesome app, love everything about. Thanks n cudos to d developer",
        "The control for setting up the cue is ENTIRELY too sensitive and it takes forever to set up a shot because you just barely touch it and it mov around when I get ready to shoot.  The game cheats also, said I fouled when the game made the shot and I lost shots because of this a few times.  I have tried 5 or 6 different pool games, this is the best I could find so far, not very pleased though."

        "The game is awesome, the heroes are unique, the graphics are cool too but, did we face against real player in match up mode, fast mode and battle royale ? Because everyone looks like an ai/bot. They just attack and die easily. It makes the game quite boring...... But still its a good game, just need a little more improvements",
        "The game is great, it's not like any other moba games i played. It doesn't lag much. My only problem right now bout the game is, it keeps saying. \"Ubstable network connection try again\" there's no problem with the internet i can browse freely and not lagging. But the game just won't let me connect it's always stuck at 15% help me asap.",
        "It was great until i lost all my progress. That was really disappointing. I had been playing for at least a week.  Edit: I was able to recover my account after redownloading a few times. Thanks! :) Also keep up the good work. This is still hands down the best mobile moba on the market... And believe me. Ive tried them all.",
        "The game itself is awesome. However. Personally when I go ranked I often see error of server  could not connect. Which is a shame cause u lose banked points for what server is wrong. Some items need to be nerves also. Like that 25 lifestyle item with 90 smh. The lifestyle is unique passive so buying it twice gives u 50 percent lifesteal. They better make that lifesteal a unique passive. Bout that one item of 205 add. They better make it to 105 +100 unique passive so people don't see the need to buy it more then twice etc",
        "Thanks for the quick fix. This is a very great and addicting game. In my opinion there needs to be some sort of quick communication method like in game chat or something to really get this game to the next lvl. I honestly have no complaints as of right now except for that. As a form mobile legends player this is I think the next step to get this game over the top. The play is great as well as the graffics a d controls.",
        "Overall a good game and highly enjoyable, that being said, I linked my account to my Google account and still lost my account after spending money. There isn't an option to log back into or recover my account as I haven't linked to Facebook. Which I think is silly. Not all people want to link a game to Facebook.   Update: My account has been recovered and for that I change my rating as this game is very enjoyable! Thanks guys."

        "I think the level system. Is too complex it takes s way too long to level after. Level 35 plz add better XP and plz can u let us gain power and get more money easy that's a problem and let us design our outfits like we want my gear is powerful and I just want a dark robe and a thin black sword with a hood but its fun plus can u let us play offlin. To each person  And a girlfriend system so u know who u marry and dragons would be cool to add like mythical. Creatures. Too add so that's what I have too say for know",
        "This game is really a good and fun game. Unfortunately, the dev ... just like most devs ... open the new server all the time which made players from old servers keep migrating to new one. After 2 weeks playing, you'll start to see empty cities in several nations. The dev nees to stop opening new server and start to merge the old servers. If not, this game won't last long.",
        "The game was amazing. Have a good quality in terms of graphics and smooth controls. However, I encountered problem in my account. After I reach LEVEL 35 my character was totally gone and advices me to create a new one. Please help me regarding with my problem. Any reply are very much appreciated. I will change my ratings after I recovered my character. Thank you.",
        "I love the game however the app always crashes..  i hope u guys fix this..... U guys reply, unfortunately im very dissapointed, now i have my doubts,   Im changing it to 1 or 0  The issue here is that the app \"crashes\" most of the times and i just wasted almost $40, for this?  Omg",
        "I really love this game. But my only problem here is the  issues of so many servers thats why other players wants to go to other servers to start playing again. Instead of focusing to the last server they had. When saying that the server is FULL it doesnt mean that all character here is active, when the new server is open everyone choose to  go there. What will happen to the other nation on the old server??? Some are ghost nation, coz everybody quits becoz of new server. Please fix this issues. Thank you.  Please bring back my 6000 power loss on my character on s25",
        "Time to Uninstall, new server open every week and nothing new about the game. Lag and disconnect every 3-5 min. It's got worst after S17 open.. this game is the same as Loong Craft just different skin. But at least loong craft server is much more sturdy. Please DON'T tell me to check connection or reinstall the game, because I already did it 3 times, connection it's perfectly fine, cuz all my other game I play run just fine."

        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "For a shoot 'em up racing android game it's really addictive. I'm always playing it. It's fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!",
        "I really enjoyed this game until it started crashing mid game. Happened to me just recently and I wasted all my available fuel trying to frantically restart the game.  I was just completing the assigned jobs when the game suddenly stalled and I had to restart it again just to find it stalling again, all the while consuming the fuel with each restart. Hope to see this problem rectified soon, otherwise it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.",
        "I enjoy playing the game. I gave you 2 stars because of one thing: the fuels are gone after I open my data connection even though it just got 5/5. Can domebody please tell me where did the fuels go.."

It's also refreshing that it's single player. That seems to be getting rare these days. My one suggestion is that there be more levels and things to do. I've only been playing for 4 days and I'm already nearing the end of the campaign. Add more missions or maybe another game mode and this game will easily earn 5 stars from me.",

Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I've ever played",
        "AWESOME man I love the game man best graphics ever! Insane gameplay I love it . I already know that Gameloft will give best graphical experience ever but the game is frikkin good .but the recent update have a slight problem. It is the details of objects takes time to form fully. But the race is done before it . Please fix this problem.",
        "You virtually have to buy them blue tokens. Not enough gold being handed out. But it gets worse, this was once a top flight game, now I wanna delete forever and never return. It Still Crashes. And None of the luxury cars, go way, way too fast and you'll never actually win either a challenge or actually race. This game is totally horrible now.",
        "You have to change the controls to tap left and right to turn. And change the sensitivity to 100%. Once that is done th controls are good.   Good game, it would have been nice to be able to play against your friends over the internet also, not just wi fi. It needs rewards in local wi fi also.. S class class cars turn with 1 second delay, which is very frustrating",
        "Best racing game on Android for me. But It we have to buy credits it the most difficult process. It will be a game-changer and very good turn if We Can sale maxed out cars which we have and get credits in Return. I guess this feature will be awesome. Love this Game",
        "I've just realized that this game is for people that have gambling addiction trates, people who will keep spending money to advance.  I got a offer to buy a car in the game, limited time offer it said only 10,000 tokens, so I looked up how much that was out of curiosity? $149! Are you for real? Someone must be on drugs to come up with these prices. I just feel sad for the ones that do pay for these so called offers. May Gameloft be cursed until you take away your greed."

NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.",
        "Buggy.  The game itself was pretty good but there are issues with the cloud save deleting peoples games + all their in-app purchases (like me). The support for the game is non-existent. They have one email address to send issues to, and it's been weeks, almost a month, since and there has been no response. So everything is gone and they can't be bothered to try and restore my account for a month.   In short, it was fun and addictive, but your game will delete itself eventually and the support staff doesn't care since they already have your money.",
        "I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I've uncovered is covered by \"treasure chests\" and there's no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I've completely run out of space and can't play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they're not opened.",
        "Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I've not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it's a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.",
        "Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.",
        "2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove \"pay to open\" boxes or they don't go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low."

I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don't even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging."

        "After using it for more 2 weeks here is my review;  This is a great time killer and addictive too. Nice collections of tools, items, etc. But when we tried to play using wifi this lagged like anything. Dead slow and we had no fun of playing and competing. The developer may look into this or give us any guidance for smooth 1vs1 play via wifi.",
        "I just started playing this game and I don't think it's live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I'd like to play against other players in the matches. I've been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I've played yet. And most realistic too. I've played badminton for about 15 years so it's nice to finally find a good badminton game.",
        "It lags everytime we use the multiplayer and the developer needs to look on the Bluetooth connection as well. Super lag. :( please update this coz I love this game a lot!  Update:  Wow! Thanks for giving me heads up! I seriously appreciate for looking into this. :) keep up the good work!",
        "decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.",
        "Game was too easy. 99.4% winrate and just passed 6500 trophies. I was expecting more but unlocking elite level tournament was all. Even after winning elite tournament nothing happened. Its a bottomless pit, there is no more progression after reaching 6500 trophies and winning elite level. Basic games nowadays have at least a multiplayer mode with leaderboard for trophies. That would be a big game changer for this but for now, no purpose in this game at all"

        "In love with it every second I used it. Have been missing it on my Coolpad Note 3 due to certain glitches with my copy of Warriors Orochi & Orochi 2. The MALI-T720 really sucks. But loving it again on my Lenovo Z2 Plus with Snapdragon 820 and Vulkan. Love the fast forward key, it makes me go LOL sometimes in games. Soon going to buy the Gold Version now as I have a better compatible device. Thank you dev for such a pleasurable claasic experience. Love ya. 😃",
        "After the recent update, the app is crashing quite frequently. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. But Vulcan support is appreciated, it seriously improves frame rate and audio, plus the texture looks nicer too. It's a blessing I can play persona 3 on my phone. Haven't tried many other games though. Will edit and update the score once the game crashes are improved. Lastly, thank you to the developer for this amazing emulator.",
        "This has continued to be an amazing app! The ability to run most PSP games flawlessly on my phone is incredible. My PSP broke a while back and I haven't had the money to buy the system again. I had missed playing my favorite PSP games. Now I still can! I highly recommend this app! I also recommend trying Dead Head Fred on it! Fantastic PSP title!",
        "I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (yes the best-of-the-best). And as soon as I selected Vulkan, instead of OpenGL all my games like Midnight Club 3, Midnight Club LA and even Gran Turismo works SUPER FAST AND ON AMAZING 5x PSP resolution. The only thing disappointing is that the emulator doesn't work full screen. *PLEASE ADD FULL SCREEN SUPPORT FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 8*. BEST PSP EMULATOR.",
        "Its a fantastic emulator and the best .. using it since 3 years..!! Gameplay is Great.. Graphics could be improved.. Sound is Glitchy (metal gear solid - peace walker).. fix it soon...!! ❤️ You PPSSPP..!!  *Cheats- I'm unable to use it.. (Make it happen soon.. probably the next update 😇) Best app on Playstore for me..!!😍😍😍 Make enhancements for HiKirin Socs.. Creators  of  PPSSPP .. please make an emulator for ps2 also (it's my wish)",
        "Vulkan update is amazing, locked 60 in so many games that struggled before at much greater resolutions. Only issue I have is it keeps crashing in Ridge Racer when I do power slides, but turning off buffered rendering  fixes it for now. Keep it up secs, this is one the best emulators going."

        "This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren't) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.",
        "I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don't do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤",
        "In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it's just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.",
        "AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)",
        "I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It's kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺",
        "I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn't know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I'm always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty ."

        "this truly an amazing game, there's really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn't say it's bad, I just don't see why you'd need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it'd be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they've purchased IRL. I bet that'd get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊",
        "My app is not opening. I love this game wish you have have out more different cards in the packs. I would like to see swords of reveling light. A bunch of rare magic and trap cards. You should not be able to use Odion's chain reaction duel sense in the PvP duels.",
        "Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it's been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you're at with the game!",
        "Real fun,  Only thing that would make me change my review to five starts would be if they allowed 5 slots for monsters and spells and increased the deck size cap.  This is one of the few free to play games I have played where you can make enough in game currency to be good by just playing.",
        "Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you're a competitive player that doesn't like to get bs, don't play this.",
        "THE ONLY REASON WHY IM GIVING 1 STAR IS CAUSE YOU DONT WANT TO CHANGE IT TO 5 ZONES LIKE THE ORIGINAL YUGIOH. Everything else is perfect the unlocking of new cards, graphics, pve, pvp, music etc..."

The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It's got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don't feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it's a good way to get your mind working if you're someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^",

        "I think that the game is silly yet good!This game does not have another level of playing. I think that the temple ruins and waterfall and the other levels are the same!e but the description given to it is a little too much. The levels do not have anything more than just the same setting. I think that the creator of his game should've made the game in such a way that it has different levels and it helps us to get more bananas or something like that. But overall, the game is pretty good. Good job on the game.😁😁",
        "I played this as a kid, now I'm playing this again as an adult and the DEVELOPER SCREAM NEVER FAILS TO MAKE ME GIGGLE. THANK YOU. U GOT MY 5 STARS",
        "Very fun and addicting game. love it. but the graphics could be better and more interesting. It just seems kind of repetitious. There should be better graphics on all levels. But still in all it's a great game!",
        "My kids enjoy this game however I think there should be an option where you can use your bananas to skip a challenge as some are quite hard to do. This will make the game better as it's pretty pointless without the challenges  Cheers",
        "It is a really nice game, but after a while it can get a bit monotonous. So you can play it and it is nice, but in my opinion you can not play it at a time over a longer period of time.",
        "It could be more interesting. After u unlock everything it seems sometimes boring.. Otherwise its my fav pastime."

        "Great game and graphics. Need to work on the optimization though as constant crashes occurs. Will also be thrilled to see rework on Yomo as he looks really plain in this game. Character collision and ability lock in also needs improvement, especially those with dashes which will be better to have single target lock in. Overall as a TG fan I love this game.",
        "A good graphics for a good beginning franchise. A well tame game for an anime base. But my concerns on playing this game is sometimes ita forcing crash. (I thought this was a high end game so basically you need a good phone that can handle a game like this) im looking forward for better improvements such as more charcaters to come. And much more sfx. Big thumbs up for this game.",
        "Ok, as fun as this game is, it has a lot of problems. Severe lagging during missions and crashing, just to name the few. On top of that, lately I can't even start up the game, cuz I get stack on the loading screen before I can even log in into the server. Very disappointed. There's hoping the devs will fix that issue soon, since this game shows a lot of potential.",
        "Bad review.. Took hours to download, though that's not the problem. I selected Facebook, logged in and everything, it went back to the start screen. Nothing happened. I tried my Google account and the same thing happened. I even tried joining as a guest but nothing happened.  There is no start button or anything. Help?",
        "I have been waiting for someone to make a Tokyo ghoul game now here it is. What can I say about this game other then its awesome I love it , but I do wish they would add more characters and maybe add some from the Tokyo ghoul re manga but anyways awesome game. Now someone needs to make a my hero academia game then a one piece game and I'll be happy.",
        "Decent game. Same game play as Marvel Future Fight. Graphics are decent. Maps are way too bland and boring though. Also feels like its too big compared to the characters. Lacking auto sign in. when game starts, maybe only gor Goggle accounts, havent tried with facebook login. Otherwise a decent game for TG fans."

        "One of the most addictive games i've played. My only issue is the firing rate of the main pistol,it's way too slow to survive 3 or even 2 enemies rushing you. Should make main pistol upgradable to at least increase firing rate to give u a fighting chance especially when u run out of ammo from the mini gun or saw because at that point there are too many bad guys ,and while upgrading the pistol,render a compensator or extended mag,filipinos would love that ish. Bottom line is ur progress after the first boss depends on premium weapons and they dont come fast enough,because the pistol is pretty much useless when there's 2 bad guys on the screen,and absolutely useless when there are 3 or more.",
        "Sana pwede ring i-upgrade yung weapons niya at magkaroon din siya ng secondaru weapon katulad sa TRAIN TO GENSAN ang hirap kase kapag marami ng kalaban wala man lang siyang laban! Pero maganda parin naman siyang laro!",
        "pwd po ba gayahin nyo nlng yung train to gensan yung ducks halimbWa kung ilan yung napatay mo na killer sa duterte ganun din ang kapalit ng badge ang hirap kce mgipon ng badge",
        "I really like the game it's fun but you should add more things in it add armor and more guns and you should add other characters.",
        "Not only filipinos loves this game,i m italian and i live in philippines..great game one of my favorito..thk a lot..mahal ko sa philippines"

Hope there is a version II coming out soon!

Cheers what up devs I didn't play for a few weeks and my progress and settings where wiped out...I started playing zombie smacker...are you the same devs???",
        "Love this game but can be frustrating when I hit the zombies and they keep going and I lose the game. After a while I have to stop as I get too excited. I hate the hiding construction workers. If I don't knock them out at the top of the screen, they get too low down and I miss them. Hate it when I accidentally hit the people when the game throws everything at you. I have a super fast finger, but, sometimes not fast enough. It takes concentration and fast reflexes to advance in this game. I gave it 5 stars.  Might go and read the help section for tips. All I want to say is try it.",

        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "It's a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it's my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.",
        "I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I'm blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I'd request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players",
        "I am facing one issue but first I want to tell you that this is the best game on play store.. It's worth to download that 1.5 gb data than 100-200 mb games.. Graphics are great. Only problem I am facing is the voice issue.. I couldn't hear the sound from last 3-4 days but I m still giving 5 stars as I hope you will solve this issue asap..",
        "This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it's a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it's a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘",
        "It's pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It's hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it's a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There's multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don't recommend this game."

        "I used to play this game a couple years ago, and at the time, it had satisfying gameplay and great time killing qualities. I used to love it then and I still do now, but I've recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that's driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn't allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I'm not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.",
        "why does it not let me on it, stops loading then says unfortunately Fruit Ninja has stopped.. not happy get it fixed please an thanksss :)",
        "I downloaded the game, and loved it. But now whenever I try to open it, it goes up to the loading screen, and then takes me back to my home screen.",
        "Great game but after I completed the tutorial it kicked me out of the app. I keep trying to get back in but it kicks me out still.",

I just purchased the chainsaw blade, the DRAGON blade was a huge desappointment we was expecting phenomenal motions not that catoon flag . Also : all the good stuff are in mini game, the others dojos are kind very less quality, let us use minigame blades and dojos in arcade or zen even by purchase that will be nice. Thank you",

Fix it please .. since you had an update , everything has change ..

So thank you Fishing Hall for my load credits of more than 3k , my Pineng 20kMAH powerbank, and my 1tb Seagate external drive. Thank you for fixing the issue right away!",
        "Why is the fish is so hard to kill my ghad Ive wasted huge amount of money just for what.. I knw itspart of this game to invest but what the H!!!.. thoses fishes are no fish its more like metal fish or something pleas make those fish a little more squishy its not fair FH",

How can I get back if the game center support doesn't answer my SMS..and when I top up they say the confirmation code sent to your number but sadly after several minutes no code send.. disgusting",
        "Before the update on January I would like to rate it a 5stars. But now after the update it sucks, its getting harder to kill the fish. And the exchange is way higher. Ex. Phone credit 300 PHP is only 113 before. And now 168 coupon, and all other items. Iphone x from 22k to 33k, just what the h. Hope you could fix it."

It is extremley interesting and i wasted hours on this game when i was supposed to do some self assigned homework😂😂 my guy died in prison and he had 6 kids. He lived a good life. He had over 1 million dollars in cash and in net worth. RIP sean. You will be missed",
        "Very run game.  Just wish you could save your progress when you have to exit out for a phone call, text messages, reboot the device or anything that requires you to exit.  That's the only reason I gave 4 🌟's. Once they add save life option I will change to 5 🌟's. Great game though. Would recommend everyone to try this game.",
        "This is possibly the greatest game on the Store right now. There so much you can do in the game and I'm excited to see what will come. And the best part is that this game doesn't require internet to play and doesn't have a great deal of ads. My friends all have iPhones and say that this game looks sweet and ask if its in the Apple Store. I have to say no, but if you guys ever plan on making an Apple version, that'd be pretty cool on their end.",
        "Add new jobs like soldier, police, and fire fighters. I love it. Can you add maps so you can see what the world looks like after war. Also can you add when wars happen a country can be annexed. Also add times of years like your born in 1984 or something like that. Edit: Make where you can be president or make rebellions. Add where what province/kingdom/state. Just some suggestions or you can make a Instlife2",
        "This game is going the right way and it could add a lot more stuff like To be able to join the military, police or even fight in a war. The devs should also add more option where you can create your custom life because changing name and location is not enough. Can't wait for the next update :)",
        "I would be happy if you could add an Racing Driver career. I'd could start with Karts at the age 4-6 and you must battle your way trough the Race series. At the End, if your good enough you could drive in Formula 1 or Nascar or DTM( Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft ). I come out Germany and I'm was amazed by Vettel and Schumacher. It's only a wish but it would be Cool if you could add my idea. If I have writing mistakes I am sorry but English is not my main Language. Bye your Johannes"

        "It's a good game but having an add after every puzzle is a bit much. Yake a bit too much time and easyy to lose interest. Maybe every 5 puzzles wo ups be better I know y'all gotta make your money but the constant ads make me want to uninstall.",
        "Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can't figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy",
        "Really fun game! Just a couple of itsy bitsy things that get on my nerves. The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??",
        "The game  is good but alot  of  adds keep poping up. but i know you guys got to make your money and that.  my kids like to play this game and they enjoy playing it but sometimes the photos don't really make sence and then they lose intrest in the game and even some times im teptered to uninstall this game sometimes when i get mad with this game.",
        "Great game. You should definitely earn at least 5 coins by default  when you solve a puzzle instead of 2 and more when watching an ad. The game seems Americanised (I'm British)  and  I didn't recognise some of the words (webmail?). Very fun though!",
        "So... I love the idea for this game. The pictures do not represent the words in the slightest. AT ALL! When you look at a photo, it Should be one of the first words to come to mind, or at least the 5th, but some of these pictures are just so freaking terrible. Just play it. You'll hate this game because how the hell are shirt sleeves representative of clothes? You have to play to understand. This is the worst game that I cannot stop playing. I have to look up half the answers because the picture is a monopoly board and the word is \"house\"... like what the heck guys?!"

        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don't even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.",
        "Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn't be putting people in the \"club\" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this \"club\" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they're INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game"

You have to have so many abilities in order to do anything in this game and it's not worth my time to spend trying to figure it out. Good luck but I am going to use my Minecraft because it actually functions properly. Nice attempt at trying to copy the original.",

But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch's, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, \"Minecraft\". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man's best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!",

But then again, there's a lot I haven't figured out yet, but it's been fun learning."

There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Addictive, colourful and charming. I love it because I've spent zero real money on it and am at over level 280! I only use my in game coins when I'm desperate and I'm fine only playing a few times a day to let lives regenerate. Some levels are so frustrating but that's why you save the coins!",
        "I've been playing this game for a while now.  My current level is 1020. I love this game. I like the idea that it's not a mindless match 3 game.  You're fixing up  the garden with Austin. I like that he sort of interacts with me. My dogs name is Elvis. I love the interaction with the neighbors.  It can be quite challenging at times but honestly, how good would this game be if it was really easy? I would think it would get boring -quick! Definitely try this game, you'll get hooked, just like me....",
        "I have really been enjoying this game but since the update 3 weeks ago every time I try and play it, it closes on me I can not play it like that and it is very infuriating. Edit: after the most recent update today the game will not even open. Not happy.",
        "I believe the game would be more relaxing if the timed levels were either gone or longer.  Also, 2 stars to complete almost anything is ridiculous.  Takes me a week to play a day.  And the rewards for levels should be higher.  Otherwise, the graphics are nice. The rewards are getting better, would still like 1 star to complete a task."

        "Don't get me wrong. I gave this game a 3 star rating but I love this one. The reason I gave this that rating is because it's ALMOST like Warframe for the PC. And I really want to see it be pushed to the limit and become THE Warframe for mobile. Maybe gave us the ability to equip the ninjas/heroes with different weapons and such which can be unlocked by your gold system and/or your diamonds. Really would give this game a long shelf life in my opinion. P.S. I love that wukong type ninja, saw what you did there. Wink wink. Keep up the good work, guys.",
        "It's certainly one of the best action platformer in mobile. Many combos to perform and playstyle to choose. Doing harder combos should be more rewarding. The way I see it, it deals roughly the same amount of dmg. Pushing enemies off cliffs or throwing them to spikes is a disadvantage since the player can't collect their souls and you can't really use the environment to our advantage if you wanna get their souls. Multiplayer mode would be awesome. One downside. So many video ads in this game. Retrying on the last checkpoint will force an ad. Playing a couple of times will force another ad, and guess what, pausing will also force a fking ad. If the ads can be removed from any purchase (not sure if that's how it is, since I can find no source) or just charge the players for $1. I'd be happy.",

        "It's an ok app and this is my third time redownloading it, the character designs have gotten better but there only problem I have, the tickets, like really? 2 tickets? First it was 5, then 3, now only 2. Not everyone has money to waste on games, especially tickets, not only that but their overpriced, like any other add on pack/item. I wouldn't even be surprised if I deleted this and redownloaded back in a year and they only give you one ticket a day.",
        "Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It's not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please",
        "It is nice that they let the readers write their own stories.  Many of the stories written by readers are more interesting than what Episode offers... The game takes too long to load when I open it and also when it loads a story.  Then you have to sit through at least two ads just to play the story. They need to let authors be able to delete their stories.  That would probably help on the loading time. Maybe if an author wants to delete their story, they have to explain why.  Then the story could be pending deletion (and have a note for readers) until Episode decides to accept or decline.",
        "I LOVE THIS! But, just a thing, you could like ask on every episode (that the app creators make) like 'what's your gender and preference to date' because all the creator made ones at like just girls, and I know males play as well. Not hating AT ALL,I LOVE this app SO MUCH! Just tryna help ya improve! Luv you episode! (Or make more that are inclusive of gender) MEOW LOVE U",
        "I really like 90% of this game. However, the way the passes are done really suck. I absolutely love when the 30 days unlimited ad free pass comes up for $9.99. Without it I practically refuse to play. It doesn't seem to be available as of a few days ago. I'm glad I recently purchased. Would also be cool to have a feature where you can send passes to friends.",
        "I love love love this game! Its really awesome to see the creativity and beauty in an interactive game. There are some things I would love to request; hairstyles. Yes there are lots and that's really awesome but if you could customize both the bangs of the hairstyle AND the back hairstyle. A more diverse set of actions and hand held items. Also, body types. I am a thin girl but it would be a whole lot more to stories if there were curvy girls and not totally buff guys. Speaking of males, male looks to me are more limited than female. Only in special stories are there more diverse male looks. Facial features such as freckles, or scars, moles, and other facial markings would be much appreciated. Gosh this is a lot but I really hope these can be added for a more realistic game play. I love the game and I hope this is seen and added in updates to come"

If this is solved after goddess kiss event, I just want my money back. I wont delete this until the problem is solved fairly.",

It feels like im just taking chances here to be able to play. This all started in the afternoon for me. Not sure bout the rest. But please take some action about this matter and/or respond to us regarding this matter, Thru facebook or here. I really like the game. Soo please. Help. Explain whats happening.

        "The app has frozen so now after each word section you have to exit and re-enter. I've email about the issue with no response. I love the game BUT exiting one round to play the next sucks !! No response as of yet from the game makers and its been 3 weeks :(",
        "Game is a good time pass but keeping a condition of 200 point if rated 5 star is not good.. If game is good  den people wil rate u 5 star if not den they wont.. Admin wil also know his shortcoming.. So admin plz change the format of rating.. otherwise the game is good.. keep it up",
        "Uses words that do not exist. I have checked these against the English dictionary and they are not there. This game is a complete scam. I don't want to use made up words. It's gibberish and not educational. What's the point if you have to enter made up words!? *This is my second review to mention this so how about an answer or do I need to email you? I think it's a scam as you are getting people to pay to play ad free on a false basis.",
        "Lo e this game however since level 140 once completed the games freezes. I have to exit the whole game and start back but I loose all my points. This isn't fair. Y'all need to fix this.  This is the game I love to play",
        "Word Connect is an addictive, challenging game that passes time while putting your knowledge to the test. I enjoy playing this game with passengers when I go on a road trip. I rate this game 8.9/10. The reason being is that several answers aren't exactly words. Despite that, I highly recommend this game.",
        "The most addicting and relaxing word game I've ever played. And there's no timer, so you can take your time and zone out. A good way for me to calm down in anxious moments."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Excellent game. Best Idle, if not best game period on the market. Not really P2W, just pay to speed up. Heroes are amazing, unique and cool. There are also lots of other things to do besides just idle and wait to get stronger. So much content and you're given free gems from watching adds. Doesn't make you pay to succeed or have fun. Literally no complaints. And that's coming from someone that just in general has an issue with 99% of mobile  games. Download this!",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don't waste it here. Good luck!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun."

        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long.",
        "I think that there could be less ads. When I'm trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads",
        "A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine's) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I'm unsure it this is the game or my phone."

Also I kinda stress about loosing everything when im not playing so a bit more info on how looting players would be cool. Otherwise I love it",

        "Love the app. Great time killer. Certain times of the day when playing I notice a change of cards I get dealt usually the after noon I start losing every hand forcing me to get off. I have a straight the next person always has a higher hand. Seems suspicious. I know u can't win all the time but still. Also private tables where only friends/poker buddy's can join would be a definite plus to add to the game. As some of the randoms just f around and bet all in from the start.",
        "For a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with no options for using one's social media profile pic. To that end frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a good game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes.",
        "I've found it very disappointing when  other user's connection is bad and their counter time takes forever while they're not even active. IMO if it happens twice they should be kicked. No one likes slow poker, especially when the player isn't even playing.  Other than that everything else is pretty awesome.",
        "It's totally pay to play. It puts you on a fast table with higher stakes to start. You burn through your initial free chips in five minutes, then you have to either wait half a day or buy more. Well I'm not waiting 4 hours just to play cards, and I'm sure as hell not spending money when it goes so fast. Not fun at all.",

        "YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D",
        "Hello! I've seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game's connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!",
        "I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝",
        "Since the game is under process - it has a lot of room to improve. The studio is generous for the rewards and daily logins. They listen to the community and it takes time to fix those bumps. Love the game and the art also - unique and tasty! A competetive game that gives you urge to hustle more. Impressive game!   Been a butthurt person before - my apologies! Hope for the best!",
        "Simple gameplay, no punishments for going AFK, simple ranked system, a little bit of P2W with new heroes and awaken system, but still based around skill, as a 4th awaken level BarBarQ can beat a 5th awaken one. Some things that we dont have counterplay to seem like complete BS at first, but once we find counterplay, it makes for an even match"

        "I play this game regularly, and I enjoy the differing modes available. You can play happily without paying for any additional content, however at higher levels paying will help you progress. By this time you will have poured hours into it, so I do not think it is unreasonable. Save your gold until later levels (player level 15+) and you can get by without in game purchases for quite a while.",
        "I'm rating this high because I've played it before and I absolutely love it. However, I cannot currently trying get it to load. I get the initial splash screen and it says 'Building camp...' The loading bar fills and then.... Nothing. It just hangs there forever. I've tried clearing cache and reinstalling. Any ideas? I'd love to play again.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Turn based tactics are one of my favourite types of games. Since playing the game more I've decided that there's not enough gas for me to be able to enjoy the game like I want to. I think the car should either hold more, or gas should be easier to get. This is just a game that already has inconsistencies with reality. Otherwise I love the game",
        "Just loved it... I am at council level 18 now... Weapon upgrade xp cost should be reduced or just remove workshop. No use of WORKSHOP with such high xp cost because its REASONABLE to upgrade your SURVIVOR than their WEAPONS.... Please for next update reduce weapon upgrade cost....",
        "I have this game, and I play this more than watching the actual show. You can bring together a motley crew of survivors for missions and get gear to make them stronger. Build a camp, in order to multiply resources, because you will need them to improve other buildings. Also, to note, this game will not allow you to get stronger unless you improve your camp. I have survivors who cannot level up until I Improve the council. The training grounds will not be built any further unless you improve the council. Its like a city/fort building game with tactical rpg feel to it.  There is a leaderboard, that actually awards you for being at a certain tier. You can join guilds to help get better gear. I love this game!  ...The con that I have with this is that every time of logging on, deals are thrown in my face, and it is enticing too.",
        "I've been playing this game for two years now and I can never put it down. It's such an amazing game. I'd like it even more though if the characters we originally fell in love with were available. Like Andrea, T-Dog, Lori, etc."

        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get.😊",
        "I like it overall, but recently random ads pop up out of nowhere.  This is quite annoying, especially when you are about to do something.  You also cannot immediately skip these ads if you wish to do so.  There is a fast forward icon for some, but only after a certain amount of time.",
        "Have been playing for a while now, great time passer. Do find it frustrating when getting orbs or dragons as prizes the you get continually get the same orbs. If gotten enough orbs to summon the same dragon 3 times while getting very few  other orbs. Or you get really close to the required number and that orb stops appearing. Hard not to spend money to save time.",
        "Don't waste your time with this game. It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don't give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don't waste your time with this game.",

Sometimes I will go a whole day with no shields and the whole time I'm getting attacked. The other thing is the bonus spin. Never have I won more that 250k coins. I know you want us to pay for another spin but maybe award a higher number once in a while. All in all cute game.",

They raise the prices of the chest to get cards and it's already hard to get the coins to build villages, get raided and attacked so much it takes months to get to the next villages. I hope y'all up the amount of coins on spins because it doesn't go up much at all but the cost of everything else shoots up like crazy.",

Most of the sets I need only 1 gold card to complete but it take ages to come...I m planing to uninstall it. And now I don't get any spins when my friend join in and the answer your customer support give was 'because one of my friend is a fake profile in my Facebook. How do I know if that account is fake or not? I invite alot of people to this game and how am I to identify who is real and fake...",

PS getting past level 80 isn't  possible so I quit. Made me so sad.if you could just make it possible to win more often I'd play it more, plus give more bombs would REALLY HELP.",
        "It's fine up to a point. The higher the level after 300+ it becomes too difficult and it forces you to spend money, which isn't that much of an issue till you see the price of the items, refuse to spend any money as it's blatant greed.  Probably uninstall if it continues like this",
        "On the advert it looks like the best game and I get two disco balls each time and merge them together and you've completed the level. Then you get the game and that rarely even happens! It's only happened once to me and I'm on level 41. Now that's saying something. It gives you a super good promise and nope it's gone out the window as soon as you get the game",
        "The scene at the end of the level is annoying and takes 5 seconds to play out. Then you have to wait for it to load back to show your stars getting in your chest and your coins. It would be better if it just proceeded to the next level saving about 30 seconds. All that to say, it's an addicting game.",
        "I really enjoyed it up until I got to like level 118. The only way I could figure out the pass that level was to use the things at the bottom of the screen or the things the page where you choose what you want to put in there in advance. But if you don't buy extra coins then you can't either had moves or get anything that will help you along. Not to mention that 100 coins per item is a lot of money. When you charge $2 450 coins. I'm taking this game off my apps.",
        "Although this game is addictive and sometimes fun, it seems the producers of the game are greedily taking advantage of people and getting them to pay money for things not worth it(but they feel the pressure to do so, so they do it). Some things in this game are deliberately set up to make the player fail and become desperate to play on and spend. The Champions League is a poor idea which produces terrible prizes for high ranks, and is just a replay of previous played levels which is a let down."

        "Simply wonderful app!! My daughter's speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it's repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn't get enough of it! Now we've moved on to shapes and colours that she's working through now at 22months. It's truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where 'Z' sounds out as 'Zed.'",
        "I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!",
        "Well I can't give 5* till I fully know,but my four yr old loves,it she's left handed, and has some problems with some words,so this helps with that,so I think its a great app so far",
        "Thank you very much for making this app available without any advertising or in app purchases, and also allowing it to store on my sd card so as to save my phones internal resources.  It is very much appreciated.",
        "It's a grate app, but my 2 year-old has trouble with the sensitivity of the screen, maybe add option to add ?",
        "Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the \"a is for apple\" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they're learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI"

I was play stage 3, but the problem is, the ball sometimes its too hard to get and last one i was play times 2 of the prize but the score of my opponent was too much fast until the score become 100 and immediately stop after reaching 100 but, the time was still running how possible happened this. Im not done. Like i said the time still running but my opponent was stop after reaching 100. This is a joke. Thats why i decided to uninstall this game.",

        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "It's a great game where you can race and customise your own car. However here are some ideas I would like you the imlament please  1. If the cars from the NASCAR can get the custmizeing like all the others.   2. To extend the custmize can yo add a tab where you can put spoilers, air intakes And other things you would put on a car.  3. Finally to make this game real racing 3 if when a race of just go to see all the car you have.  There be a \"i\" button that will give the player real information about the car the player is looking at."

        "Its a good game. If you had the ability to sell certain things back it would be nice, or a way to earn more keys. I got the dog house and wasn't even close to affording a dog. Now I'm stuck with a dog house that just takes up space. Fix that and you'll get five stars",
        "I love this game in every manner, way shape and form. It's awesome because it is a strategy that for once does not involve violence and agression. I enjoy playing it because of the social aspect of the game, being the co-ops with which you can trade and befriend other players. A lot of people complain about how long everything takes, but in my opinion everything takes just the right amount of time.",

        "Guys this game is the best offline game I have ever played as it is toooooo much addictive. U would not believe me, firstly u would die very easily but as u play on then it would be easy to create high score. It also makes your reflexes more faster. The creators have done a great work. And people who are saying there are lots of adds are talking rubbish.  Play it!!!!!",
        "Want to play an ad? Download this game and you'll get to experience all the thrills of pop up ads between brief stints of playing the game you thought you downloaded instead of the ads. There is at least two ads per game. Some of the ads go landscape to further increase game play pleasure, X one out and Bam! Bonus round go straight to the app store to see the ad you X'ed out available for download. Go back and BAM try the X again YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACE. Good times were had played ten games and uninstalled. ADWARE ten millions downloaded how many kept it longer than twenty minutes.",
        "It's so fun with all the different types of patterns.im telling you its the best game you will play in your life.When I die it's actually quite good, because the last time I did had 100 to spend and when I had passed the next 4 rounds I had 10,000 to spend so you should realy get this game,and Change your life people.Plus the new thing is the star block makes you invincible for a short amount of time for example I was going when I had 93 and I went in 24 star and I Could go through 100 and 123,000 for 1 minute. Anyway great game if you liked my review go onto Episode to see that review. Hope you love the game. Oh and I forgot to tell you a list of all the patterns we have purple, green,rainbow,pink,🍔,💵,🚗 and grey.",
        "It's a very fun game with so much to offer, the snake colors are very funny and colorful, but one thing I do not like is that there are SO many ads! When you simply try to restart a game it makes ANOTHER ad pop up for the 35 time. Please fix this issue.",
        "Nice concept, nice controls, the problem is that is too much randomnes and less skill. It forces me in corners where I'm definitely dead or the good boxes are in corners where i can't go because of the walls and that also means im dead. Please make it less random or ar least make that if i comith to a path and because of the game i cant chage is, at least dont make the first mistake ista death.",
        "It's to many ads like beyond the amount I've seen on any other app. You lose a life then there a 30 sec ad after every time you lose a life. When the ads over you jump right back into the game. Making it difficult to play because it doesn't give you enough time to make your next move. If they remove the ads may it would be a better game."

        "Amazing! I love it but I absolutely HATE that you only get 1 key every 2 hours. And once you get 2 keys it stops giving you them. I love the freshman and I'm on chapter 11 but it will take me ages to finish all of them as the lack of keys you give. I think it should be 2 keys every 1 hour and the keys come non-stop. I will change my review to a 5 star if you consider and use some of these suggestions. Thank You.",
        "I freaking love this game but I do recommend more energy or at least less time to wait for energy. Please and thank you :)  P.S. We need more diamonds some how like. Maybe you should let us watch ads for 2-5 diamond's each ad. Or do a daily login type thing. I know you guys wont but I've been playing this game a ton and for a long time. i restart everything because when you guys make new stories it makes me want to use diamonds but I don't have anymore. I restarted the game like over 10 times honestly. Thanks for a great game though.",
        "I absolutely adore this app. I'm addicted to it. Im not that bothered that it takes two hours to get one key because it gives you time to do other things like go outside and have fun. And besides you can easily just start a different series. The first chapter of each book doesn't cost anything. I don't really like the fact that once you have got two keys it stops giving you them. I am on the sophomore book one chapter nine. It's really exciting so far. I think this app is a really good influence on kids to get them into reading. Overall I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!",
        "I never thought I would find a game like this that would work so well and play so easily! The only things I would change would be adding videos to gain more gems, or getting 2 gems after each chapter. Maybe even some extra gems after finishing a story? Getting gems on previously finished stories as well. I would also add the option to replay a chapter from the menu, not only after playing the chapter. Other than that, THIS GAME IS A MUST PLAY!",
        "Ok, so unless there is a secret version of this game that I don't have, your ads are misleading. I see ads about stories that don't exist in this app like the one where the girl is pregnant or the \"blood bound\" one. Please have what you say you have. Also diamonds are bloody expensive, seriously! How long is it going to take before you fix the no. 1 complaint? And one diamond per chapter? That's cheap. The stories are well written and intriguing but the cons outweigh the pros. I'm reducing my rating.",
        "I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I've purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I'm really hooked on. Not to mention I've put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I'm limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It's just too expensive in the end."

        "lnstaII 'VEARN' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn't come back in the next game, but it's understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it's currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they're not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that's the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don't get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could've bought something else with it but I didn't because I like sims.",
        "Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools \"playable\",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it'd be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.",
        "First, I don't like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don't like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you're just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!",
        "im not sure what's the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they're walking, they legs dont even move! it's like they're flying, plus when they're doing any action like \"clean the dishes\", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).",
        "For the fact that we can't sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it's a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it's in the real The Sims games."

        "Cool game... Control needs work though, and can you make it easier to upgrade characters.. I can't spend the amount of time I used on just carrot on any other character... It would be a massive waste of time  P.s... Please tell me you're working on goku's new angel like ultra instinct form...",
        "I love the graphics and play. I think its really good for those who wants dragon ball feature like game for smartphones...but i think the menu need no be too much of animation maybe perhaps if its kept on color background pics and also the character selection be kept simple but lucrative. I feel the controls needs more refinement. Not jusy the basic ki wave ability but also one, two or more iconic abilities(also like some transformations). And also with more definitive saga like plot line and training session options. Another problem i found is that i can't switch to other characters...for me its still stuck to this Rayon character.",
        "I will give five star add ultra instinct mastered. I loved this game. But can u make instinct sprite mastered as well. And in training why cant we selecte opponent awaking no.plz give jeran as well and ultra instant more awaking i will give 5 star",
        "Great game. You guys sure had a hard time making the game is overall awesome. While playing with carrot and vegetable I think that I am playing some official dragon ball game. The character design and the graphics are outstanding. I wanna be a supporter too! I suggest you to make a manga of the game and after making that I suggest you to make a story mode too which is related to the manga you made. If you want any help in making the manga just ask me. I am a pretty good artist and I really wanna help you make this game even better. Hope you read this creators. Have a good time.",
        "Smoother blocking and the into transition of the teleportation.  It gets confusing with the little button. Maybe just specific simple controls for come characters . The upgrading could be simpler",
        "Fantastic game! Only thing I would add is maybe a multiplayer option or a local feature so you could fight your friends."

I love it then the flowers and how they bloom are fantastic and problem solving I need to play before I can go to sleep and it doesn't matter what time of night it is. I didn't have a TV for a whole year all I had was Blossom Blast Saga and I was alright and in love I have to have it",
        "Love a challenge. Very very beautiful blooming flower I could play all day just for the beautiful  graphics  makes me feel like I'm outdoors even at night closed up in my house. It make me very much like there is a gorgeous world out there. This game makes me feel like LOVE is in this cruel messed up world. I really believe if some of these crazies out there would play this it would change their out look on life. And live in a caring and loving life.",
        "Do not try this game.  NO rewards, extremely expensive power ups, you spend weeks on one game if you don't buy coins to win.    Rigged, like crazy rigged.  Bees are supposked to be GOOD things, NOT pests that PREVENT you from making winning moves.    I NEVER get lives, but ALWAYS send, sometimes twice in one five live gameplay.   Lazy, greedy devs that ruined a game that could've been fun.  Instead, it is frustrating like another job.  Shame on you.",
        "Takes a month or more to see NEW levels. I am addicted to this game, and complete the  level set before another  is updated. Extremely frustrating. Also no way to earn gold for purchases or earn bonus turn like in Farm Heros saga another King game.",
        "I really enjoy the graphics. The blooms are awesome. I would've rated it 5 stars except there are no rewards so the only help you can get you have to buy. I don't mind working at a puzzle if there is at least some chance of some reward."

        "I've been on Township since 2015 and I absolutely love it. Its the first game I play in the morning and the last one I play at night. This game has so much personality. From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I've played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don't have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.",
        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game.",
        "Well this game is better then most farming games i have played. The crops dont die is a major plus for me . The only thing i dont like is the wait time for things i think there to long at times. But other wise one of my fav games . Love the notification sounds there fun and i really enjoy the club that u can join find a good one like i did and u have a bunch of nice and helpful ppl. Would recommend playing this game and all the others tjis company makes"

I've finished them all and am waiting for an expansion. Would be great if future levels don't include any tutorials though, it was annoying to go through the tutorials again after already doing them for the 1st cafe. Would be great if we didn't have to start from 0 difficulty for each cafe as well",

Update: the developers listened to feedback and have been adding numerous ways to get advantages for free. Here is some respect for listening to your users. Rating increased!",
        "Excellent game!!  Very addicting!  Can't put it down!!  :)  Only reason I am downgrading it to 3 stars is because of the horrible unfairness of what levels can attack other levels.  Like being a level 8 and being attacked by a level 28.  Needs to be fixed fast!!  One player will comme in and wipe out all of an Alliance that is much lower in power and defenseless.",
        "One of the most unattractive games I've ever come across. Good idea to fill up the playing screen with so many icons, yeah that's not going to be a irritation for me when I'm trying to click on something. \"Build an empire\" they say. Well, with such bad graphics. I don't think I'll even bother building one. Horrible. That's the word for it.",
        "The game has a lot of fun and addictive features. Its major drawback is that it's geared towards people who can spend $1000s  Don't get me wrong, it is still a great game, but if you don't plan to spend on a major scale, you will be disappointed",

        "I enjoy the game a lot. It is pay to win in every sense of the word though. My problem is customer service is the worst. Takes 5 or 6 days to respond to help requests if they do at all. Good game, worst customer service possible."

        "Most intrusive ads ever. The game is great. Fun way to kill time. But the ads are horrible. It will sometimes open my browser to some sketchy foreign site, which then opens pop-ups saying that my phone has viruses and I need to download this so and so app. Really ruins the game.",

Thank u",
        "I love the game and the vast amount of playable characters, however the sound effects overall aren't great but the gameplay is very good. One problem I do have however is that there are in models (such as thanos and Kang) but you can't play as them. Personally thanos is easily my favorite marvel character and the fact that I can't use him is a little upsetting. But overall its a great game with monthly updates and great new characters! Can't wait for more!",
        "I am using vivo v5 plus.. Game is running smoothly but after current Android update all apps are running good except mcoc.  After one or 2 fights or after 5 to 10min of login, it's shows connectivity problem.  Kindly give right patch...  I will give you 5/5",
        "Great fighting game with lots of characters and abilities. The main fights are very fun, good mix of effort and strategy. However, the loading times often kill the flow of quests and the current alliance member cap makes it difficult to receive help from your team members. Game's good, just make alliances a bit bigger and maybe eventually add real PVP. That would make this game for me."

After playing for a little while I couldn't help but feel like I was waiting for a little bald guy to want to eat me if I got an answer wrong, \"cans we eats it precious\". Jokes and riddles. Very good game. Well done.",
        "Game is really good specially for kids . Makes them think. Only bad part of this game is the list in answers.. they are already displayed. This makes the game very easy. It would make an awesome game if user had to enter the answers.. hope the developers fix this!",
        "Way TOO MANY adds. It's more a front end for advertising & the questions are way to simple to the point of being inane. Mildly entertaining if you like to feel smart but only a diversion for a matter of minutes. Personally I much rather apps where for a payment you can remove the adds but this isn't one!",
        "I found \"500 Riddles\" to be somewhat misleading.  After the first few levels the riddles started to repeat. (Either the exact same riddle or the same riddle worded differently) Also grammar and punctuation errors in the riddles started to get annoying. But overall I did enjoy the program.",
        "The game could use a few fixes. Sometimes when you touch a level it is unresponsive. The stage count is weird. When you completed all stages of a level it says 9/10. Please fix this the overall game isn't bad but these are very easy no brainer fixes.",
        "It's fun.... But way too many adds. Still love playing it....but it's just annoying... Ok so to add to this: im on level 19 now and a LOT of the riddles are repetitive...again, still a good game and good time waster but I'd prefer new and harder riddles as the levels go up ... Just some advice to the maker of this game!"

And what are the power pellets  for 🤔??oh  no I can see Amy's under wear  and when shadow and Amy fall's  from the bonus  stuff or a boss when they land they run like sonic for two seconds and Amy run bad",
        "What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn't be playing it if I couldn't play as Pac-Man, he's such a good inclusion. It's a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you're prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.",
        "The game is really solid, serving as a great precursor to Speed Battle in terms of basic gameplay. The missions and occasional events really give the game some gameplay value and the music is a really nice tune, but it will get old not too long after you start playing. I think it's a shame that the characters have no differences; it's purely aesthetic. Different abilities for the characters would have rocked, and Speed Battle improved this slightly, but not much. It's definitely worth a play or two, but don't stick around too much, you're not missing much.",
        "Sonic dash is a fun speed based game I play it about 20 mins a day! P.s. PLS ADD CHAOS  and I still know that chaos is in forces speed battle but still and also why didn't we have a chaos fight in forces?and add zero from Sonic adventure dx as Amy's boss.",
        "Literally nothing works since the latest update!  If you're lucky, it'll actually boot up, but even then, only half the buttons work, and not the essential ones, such as PLAY!  I had to delete the game and reinstall to get it to even semi work in the first place, so of course, I lost all of my progress due to it not syncing properly with Google Play, all the characters were unlocked via hundreds of Tokens that I'd collected, I'd maxed out many of the characters, and had over 220 Red Star Rings.  Shambles.",
        "It was good. Mostly positive things to say. I wish I could go from one round to the next faster, though, without all of that extra stuff. Also, way too many ads."

        "Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I'm watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.",
        "This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.",
        "Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don't want to see them.",
        "Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad's are repeatedly played and I can't skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad's... after 2nd level game is very easy didn't find much interesting..",
        "Agree with other comments. Great graphics, fun to play, but the ADS!!!!!!!! eventually destroy the fun. Very repetitive after a while and challenge levels seem quite mixed. Have decided to delete the game mainly because of the ad onslaught. Other games have a much better ad/play psychology approach.",
        "Great time killer and keeps the brain ticking good fun. Ads are annoying but it's free and you can pay about £1.50 to get rid of them if your that bothered 🤔"

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",

        "Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There's been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5",
        "The cars slide like they're on ice, but with no consistency at all, half of the cars are all wheel drive, which can't drift well, and there's even a nice little front wheel drive CRX, which wouldn't be able drift at all. Also the high-end cars are just the low end ones, wide bodied into smithereens, but the developers didn't bother to bring the wheels out to the fenders. If you want a decent drifting game just download CarX",
        "Game is really good. Best drift game I've ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn't finish the race and it gives the \"wrong way\" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this."

        "Awesome game! It is user friendly even on f2p players. May I just suggest one thing? I think it would be fun if you could get on and off your mount anywhere. Be it on the town or at the battle field. But so that it wont be used as a means of scape, it should have a casting time to ride the mount. Over all it is the best game there is. Love it to the moon and back! =)",
        "This game is awesome actually but the developer keep opening new servers instead of merge the server. So many people choose to stop to play Seal because of this since less people play in most server. So please don't waste your money and time to play it. You cannot transfer your character to other servers. You need to start from begining. This make the overall experience becoming so bad.",
        "Good game overal. But.. Admin.. Can u please explain to me.. How to use old account when i use other phone? Coz its keep make me new character. Cant use the main. I log in using samsung play. Or can i bind with other account? Pls help me. Coz i change use 2 phones.. And the other one always run off battery. Thanks",
        "I love this game, it's so addicting. But I only gave it 4 stars because we have too many servers. I highly suggest to not add many servers and just fix the older ones because the players in older servers are getting fewer. Like, I'm in S105, and it's not been a week but there's already another server? And it's draining players. Please stop adding servers so some servers will have players too.",
        "I really loved this game. Its content its gameplay indeed it is really my taste. However, i hope that we can transfer into other servers without restarting ones account. As well as the timing system of each events sometimes its not exact. Hope you guys work on it to make this GAME BETTER. Pleaseeeeeeeeee!!!!!!",
        "Please help retrieve my money. I buy 4,500 diamonds but I haven't received the items but I've already debited 2,845.   Here's my account details kindly check my old transaction. This is not the first time that happened. I've debited 3 times without receiving tne diamonds. Thanks  Server:  s92 Ingame: GS28"

        "Thank you for makes this game,  I hope next time u guys can imporve the game like a : 1. New Menu 2. New Decor 3. New event every month, for give us new decor or something like that.  And also dont forget if u guys make maintance, give us green money (cash) cuz' we want it.",
        "It's a great game, I had fun playing it with friends. But there's much room for improvements in the game.   Sometimes there's a little glitch in the game where a guest is stuck, item name shown weirdly, etc. It'll also be great if the token and vouchers are easier to find, and maybe other ways of getting revenue.   I also feel like the cafes are located in Zimbabwe, where finding money is hard, but all the items are expensive, that would be great to fix too!  None the less it's an overall good game. Can't wait for the next update!",
        "Doing the tournaments is a waste of time!   You don't earn any prizes and if you do it's one 1hr bottle at least that's what i got so useless! Why can't we cook food instead of stupid stuff that some of us don't have enough of like CL vouchers! This game has gotten boring! Think I'm going to uninstall.",
        "Up until the last update, all was good. But with the most recent update I keep trying to open and it claims there's no internet connection. I have triple checked the settings and those all check. I've even uninstalled and reinstalled it. No luck. Shut my phone off and on again, still does nothing.",
        "Thus far the only downside I have found is the fact that it is so dam expensive to expand. And the quests just never seem to end. Which yes in my opinion is annoying. Getting a quest every time you complete one makes it kinda hard to know what I am supposed to be doing. Hince the reason my diner is still so cramped. I was doing them in the order I got the quests and before I realized it I had no room and a bunch of stuff I can't place. I just sold 4 tables and chairs to have room. So if you could resolve these issues that'd be great",
        "The game is good fun and relax to play. However, I give low rate because everytime our food is cook, its always lack the game. And also, 2 time happen to me that I spent alot of hour playing tournament and my club friend got the price but ai didnt get the price. So dissapointed."

        "Its Cool but there is a lot of Flaws,  like the Gem system? 9.9  I can't update my special if I don't use Gem?   Upgrade system,  cost a lot and I earn little per completing stages so?  Gg!    More like play to win game!  Then every stage,  has 5sec adds..  I can't even have option to say NO?..  So 4 star coz it made me like it!  It has potential but it needs major changes tho~",
        "Could of been 5 star. But Jesus the ads! You spend 40% of your time outside a match watching adverts! Didn't these people make Deep Town? and that's done very well... Also you hit a pay wall at the ice area where you have to pay to win. Unless you log on every day and collect the 1 gem, then you can upgrade in about 2 months...",
        "The time for upgrades only increments when the game is running and the phone is unlocked. That is ridiculous.  Upgrades take too long and the gold to buy them is gained too slowly during game play.  If I go check my mail, talk on the phone, dock the phone for the night, etc, no time passes on the upgrades. If there is 6 hours left on the upgrade when I go to sleep, there is still 6 hours left when I go back and check the game in the morning.",
        "Terrible game. Set up horribly. Plenty of room for more towers and easier gameplay. Little room for personal strategy which in turn guides you to purchase crystals with real money to beat the game... another garbage excuse tor a tower defense",
        "Great game overall, I haven't spent a $ on it and beat the game in under 2 weeks all stages 3 stars but 3 challenges that I need to still upgrade my towers to get 3 stars.   The one downside I see to this game so far is not enough maps or stages to do. Once you have completed all stages you kinda have to replay the survival endless maps over and over again to get gold... just adding new stages would make this game a 5 stars for me.",
        "As with others, it has its appeal but there's no getting away from its flawed gameplay, rather than heading toward victory, achievement, accomplishments, success, and all those positive responses of older TDG's; we're led toward spending to succeed. It utterly avoids the aspects that made TD so appealing to users. I found it impossible to feel good winning as a result which defeated its purpose to an extent.  Overall, two 🌟, for entertainment."

        "An interesting game, it gives the planes a slightly paper feel when viewing them. However, the actual controls are smooth although they can be slightly twitchy at times. The addition of game modes recently was a welcome change to the game and has helped me through many hours of boredom. This game overall is very good and I advise you download it.",
        "Sensitive and strange controls. You pay for no ads and they still offer you a free life if you watch an ad. If you do decide to watch the ad you don't even get the life. Zoom levels on the challenges are unreasonable.  Great concept for a game, terrible UX, and dishonest marketing.",
        "Awesome......  I love this game.....  So good know!  Nice game but too much adds.....  U can make some more  planes ae paid.....  But plz remove adds.....  U make some planes to buy in real money too....  Also some levels too...  But worst thing is adds...  Plz remove them all",
        "When I look to see how to unlock the planes it cuts off at the \"unlock with\" and then I can't see anymore of how to do so. Also I bought no ads and there still are ads at every corner. It's a fun game but way to many bugs to enjoy completely",
        "Last update killed it. Can't even see the bottom row to select anything. It's covered by an ad and the aircraft selection covers it as well and won't go away. Makes it unplayable.",
        "This game is absolutely garbage. It's a rip off and the graphics are terrible. Don't waste your time on it. It burns your phone and every second there is a add"

I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we're able to take care of the premies and foster them until they're adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.",

        "I kind of hated this game because it seen not realistic and it Barley let you do anything yourself but it would be good of really little kids.",
        "nice, but it would be better if the babies weren't always the same. like when your done with their picture and want to play again, it shouldn't be always girl babies, and it shouldn't always be twin babies. please change that problemo. it's boring. 🤓",

        "So far I dont get any problem with the game.. I like the graphic so much its cute and cool. And this rhythm game is so addicting. Especially when you get the precious card.. feels like you want to collect all the card. I always appreciate dalcom for giving a new update and a new song every week. Thx btw Edit: but my only question is what for ticket needed for the game? Its just show 0 and never changing",
        "THIS IS SO GOOD AND ADDICTING. But I hope more songs will be added, like atleast one song per week? Or even once every two weeks you have a new song 😭😭. And also I hope it don't just crash once in a while. But keep up the good updates! Fighting!",
        "Absolutely beautiful! I don't know if this is possible but if you can, maybe add a chat room? It gets kinda boring when I'm all alone because Im the only one who plays this game in my group of friends. I would also like to chat to the people who I'm competing with and see what they think! It doesn't have to be like you can choose who. Maybe the same ppl you are in the league with. But overall a gorgeous game!",
        "To the creators of Superstar BTS, JYP and SM, I would like to acknowledge you for creating such great apps which satisfy us fans very much. Another thing is, I would also like to suggest you to make one Superstar Game for PLEDIS specifically Seventeen. They deserve more attention and love out of all their hardworks and independent showcasing. Kamsahamnida! Hwaiting!",
        "Sorry, I can't play this game since last week, it says that I have to restart downloading to play it. I tried to uninstall and install it again but it still freezing and says I have to restart downloading again also it happens to my friend. So, what is the best way to play this game or what should I do? Thank you so much",
        "I really like this game because I get to enjoy bts song while playing and collecting cards specially signature card are cool too but I had also encounter little problem. Sometimes I don't receive reward, the game notify that I receive award like every weekend there are free card pack, the game notify that I receive the reward on my inbox but when I open the app there was no reward to claim."

        "Great Effort but can't give 5 star rating as the game only gives you very little time to check the spelling of many words. While it should have been like 15-20 seconds for checking each of the words spelling & then the next. 10 to 15 words can comprise each level and the words going to be harder as one goes up in the levels. This will be fun for sure. Other wise in current context folks will get disheartened sooner than expected and would cease to play it and that I suppose should be amended ASAP. Thank you.",
        "You need to make up your mind if you are using British English or US English. Seems Americans don't realize the past tense of 'spell' is either 'spelt' or 'spelled' in the US you don't often see it spelled 'spelt' (LOL) although both SPELT AND SPELLED ARE CORRECT. You do this with other words with US & UK spelling differences.  You forget both are correct. It was British English a thousand years before it was American English. Americans have been BUTCHERING English for about 300 years now.",

        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It's entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell",
        "Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I'm playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!",
        "It had been almost 3 years since the last time I gamed. I looked at a couple games throughout that period of time, neither really jumped out at me. I tip my hat to the creators of a game that literally brought me back from the brink, no interest whatsoever in gaming. Absolutely love game. I look forward to seeing more of your work in the near future."

    "description" : "Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun.

    "descriptionHTML" : "Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.<br><br>Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless &#x201C;tap to move&#x201D; and innovative &#x201C;swipe to cast&#x201D; controls, and its player-friendly &#x201C;no paywalls, never pay to win&#x201D; philosophy.<br><br>With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.<br><br>Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it&#x2019;s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.<br><br>The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game&#x2019;s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.<br><br>Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.<br><br>As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.<br><br>Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.<br><br>Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.<br><br>Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.<br><br>Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.<br><br>Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear.

        "It is a normal car racing game with a very good graphics. There are four types of challenges. Elimination, one v/s one, test match and classic (6 people). The most hard task is to earn points so as to colour, repair and buy new cars. It takes so many gameplay for buying a higher model car with better class(C, B, A, S). It is a good game but it can't be completed without investing money. It's a good one for time pass and learning drift and nitro skills",
        "A very good for racers. The controls are butter smooth. Enjoyed while playing. But the main problem is that I was promised that I would get 20 gems after reviewing but promise wasn't kept. It's really difficult to earn gems/diamonds and also on the other hand most of the purchases are based on this. So...... Look into this.",
        "The multiplayer option is not working I am also not able to log in using my Google account. Very difficult to unlock cars as it is very hard to earn gold only option is to buy it. Don't feel like playing it any more.",
        "Warning! DUMBEST GAME EVER it will say rate for 20 gems then when you have rated it nothing will appear. Graphics bad, controls bad, and worse you can't even upgrade your cars cause its hard to earn money. Nice try suckers",
        "Most of the Cars are so costly and 80% of cars you can't buy with gold but with gems...and its very difficult to collect 18 gems while they ask for 1800 for a single car.. Game is good but when you loose races just because of unavailability of good cars at gold then its good to uninstall it at that moment..please give more cars at less gold so that players can enjoy",
        "Excellent game for older smartphones. Just lacks a pause button. However, In app purchases are outrageously expensive & don't get you very far in the game (i.e. you have to keep spending if you want to progress). There is NO WAY I would ever spend 30$+ on a mobile app, especially as you would have to invest several times as the levels increase."

        "This is a very fun game. It got me hooked for hours. However, there are still some things that need improvement. For example, when walking sideways along fences you can get over them. This is an issue as once i did this and fell into the water not being able to get back on. Also, the spikes do not seem to have an effect on the shark so they are useless. I do believe that the developer needs to continue to work on this game and introduce new items and uses for them.",
        "It's honestly a pretty good game, it's fun, even though there's no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it's really bad, and it's insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.",

        "You cannot walk on wooden fundations and you cannot walk on single or double foundations. Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it"

They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...",
        "I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I'm not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain't getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15"

        "I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points",
        "This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they're back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it",
        "They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It's definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you'll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.",
        "Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don't be fooled. This is a pay to win game.",
        "A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is \"FREE\". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....",
        "I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that's cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!"

        "Awesome game, I thought that when the main guns didn't fire but the wings, I figured it was part of the game! Helpful tips to make it better, use the main gun outage glitch as part if the game, its brings more of a challenge!!!, don't give us a set of wing man's right off the bat, make us earn them or buy them....., little bit smaller ships in exchange for more ships, last but least scale down the size of the fire effects! PLEASE PLEASE, don't make easy for us!",
        "The game was easy. Short rounds it's good if round is little more big. Last 40th round have bug's. boss not defeated not hited. Boss came from right side and move to left then stuck at left side. Boss no firing not moving. I hope it will soon and I can beat the 40th boss too.",
        "I have zero respect or tolerance for a game or app that allows and promotes ridiculous ads to interrupt gameplay. I don't mind the occasional ad AFTER a mission/level, but DURING? I uninstalled right away and would advise anybody looking for this Galaga type of game to keep looking and NOT download this one.",
        "Can't upgrade ship any further. Can't  get a new ship. Level 40 boss doesn't fight back and stuck shooting at him. Main gun fires intermittently and there are no further levels. Great game for the first 30levels then that's it. Waste of time.",
        "It's still has some bugs on it. I got to last boss of the game and it doesn't  hit the boss or the won't even fire back or move. And it only the pets fire and the main weapon gets stuck of my ship. And because of that I can beat the game.",
        "This game is very simple, and easy to pick up and play! The only main issue I have is that the images are quite large. If it was zoomed out a bit, I'd love it a lot more. I'm on my way to clear all the levels soon!"

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",

Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",

        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least"

        "It's a great app. The levels are really interesting. However the developer should take off the setting that makes it mandatory to seize two men even when there is another place to take just one",
        "It's worth the download, the game makes you think it's not always so easy to beat the computer. It makes you do some thinking thorough out your day",
        "Loved the first level, second level no longer allows me to jump so I literally can't play. Good concept bad execution. Fix the glitches and this would be a 4 star game."

        "What the f..k? Every time i watch a video for an extra bird I get nothing. Its pay to play not play to have fun... How long till they will get low ratings? I see the comm are all complains only about every thing in the game. Cant blame people they are right.",

Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day."

The challenges menu should have a retry option so that when you fail a stage, you don't have to go back to stages menu and choose the stage which you were playing. Retry button will ease the problem.  Other than that graphics and challenges part is great.👍",

        "Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.",
        "It has a progression system, but it's completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It's a good timekiller.",
        "Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely",
        "Good game. Though it could be better. Make range on weapons and protection when you have armor on. Then you should be able to unlock new settings besides the train. Multiplayer would be cool. Another (and the last) thing you could implement is a way for you to go back and beat the bosses you defeated already to earn money. Despite all the flaws I've stated, it's a good game and time killer.",
        "Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don't allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can't do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.",
        "The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I've opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10"

And the best part is you can play it offline. I always play it when im bored and thiss game is the best time killing ever. But i have one question, can i buy a slot in creating a new hero using my load cause it says that i dont have enough credit even if my load is enough to pay it. So that i can make a new character in my game. Thats all and i hope you reply on my question ASAP😉😉❤❤",

Im playing offline and My phone just shut down and when i open the game again it reinstall then my character is gone.. i was not able to save the current progress in back up storage in the game.. try to dl my previous save but it was so far behind like half of my gold and some item and 1 reset..",
        "This is by far the most epic must have hackNslash phone game I've ever played and the best part its FREE!! No $$ or internet req to play, outstanding details and a good challenge. Perfect for dungeon loving/hackNslash  gamers! 200/100 can't wait 4 what's next!!",
        "Very repetitive at the end.. i never spend money on free games but i have bought every thing possible on this game. I do not play anymore but has been by far the best mobile game i have played to date. Infinitely better than lineage 2 by netmarble. Thank you shinybox for the exceptionally good game.",
        "Overoll the game is great. But i have some problem here. I tried to sign in with e-mail but nothing being sent to me . I tried many times and the result still same. So plis fix quickly this if you want five stars.",
        "can please add guilds and global chat.   Add new weapons pets make the lvl higher because it does get boring after a while just doing the same thing over and over and in PvP its vsing bots not real players its there ACC's but not them controlling them  add new roles. you can do so much to make this game so much better  like add a PvP that guilds vs guilds like 10v10 or 5v5 somethink like that would be so cool or a story mode to would be great. Anyways hope you would add something like this one day anyways great job on game"

But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that's some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.",

        "Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it's the other way around, dumbass.",
        "I think this game was made because with new levels in original version they added new effects, but the levels were very hard for normal players and they were designed for pro players, so they decided to make easy levels with new effects (like wave...). The goal has been met and this is very good game.",
        "Hardly worth downloading. I love the full version of the game and figured this world be similar, or at least have some interesting levels, but much to my dismay it does not. The levels are easy and somewhat boring, which is unfortunate because Geometry Dash is usually neither of those things.",
        "I think this game is going to change your life once you start is going to test you all you know you need to be focused to pass the whole entire thing and make sure you try to get all the coins good luck out there and may the best guy win or woman"

The thing that I like the most in this game is that , there are more than 100 levels and that if free of cost. What amazing and challenging game. But there is something that I really don't like  andbi want to warn you while you are downloading this game. The thing is that whenever you had completed a level an advert comes always. And that is really very annoyed for me. Well all over I want to say that it's  a really very good game and I am very gald that I am on 22nd level and soon I will be in in 23rd.",

        "Totally addicted!  This game goes from basic kg tic tac toe to 6 in a row and challenging the higher level u go over 100 levels so worth it!  And Free!!!",
        "If there is to many ads airplane mode is good this is a awesome game but some other stuff are a bit off I still rate 5 stars ... Nice game also it is very cool so ever thing is great u guys who made it are a good creaters nice game so nice thanks it is cool",
        "Great game i like the multiplayer thing and i also like the ranking or the leaderboard what i dont like the most are the ads too many of them but i know you vcant remove them cause u need to earn money but please limit the ads just let the ads show when the player loses Great Game",
        "The game is interactive. Please look seriously into the language mixup. I have chosen English but a lot of things (esp on the exit menu), the language is different. Hope the developer knows the language difference!!!!"

I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying \"Ready? Let's go!\" voice when the sound is on.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.",
        "Liked it but sometimes it just wouldn't give me the right bubbles to win at the end when I absolutely could've. If there's 4 bubbles left and none of them are yellow why do you give me a yellow one? I felt cheated",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item."

The AI got worse at the same time, so it's not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.",

And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. 💘 the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants 🐟 and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with 🎶 turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A☆' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it's a great game lol I enjoy playing it.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.",
        "Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can't do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!"

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",

        "Everything was great except in the beginning it kept saying I didn't find any mice but I found them twice on the first one.. but then I restarted it and it worked fine.. until it kept freezing and I had to restart my tablet.. after doing that like 5 times it worked great thru out the whole game.. I kinda felt like it was a lot shorter then the other games. But other then that I had fun playing it and I'm super excited for other to come out so hurryyy!!!!!!! Lol",
        "This is just like the other game you guys made, the one with the doctor in the hospital, down to the exact same thing of \"play the first couple of levels for free but if you like you pay\" I bet this one is for the same price. On a side note, the story is different but the game play is the same, go have a look if you want. I will say this is a good game and I take nothing away from the hard work you have done. Good looking graphics, good smooth game play. A game you can get into and do try the other games of this developers you may like it as well. Over all a good game I just do not think it is worth $15. But best of luck guys.",
        "Thanks thanks thanks!!! I have played many of the Emily's and Hearts games.. I bought many of them as well. I understand the cost of making these awesome games with beautiful graphics... but I'm happy you are also thinking of your fan's pockets this time. Thanks for giving us the option to choose to buy a full version or keep playing free with ads for this games. I read the options several times, couldn't believe my eyes .. thanks thanks!!!😍😍😍  Sadly, right after I said this.. I realised there's a bug. I played challenge3 three times.. the app keeps shutting down.😣",
        "Great game  I don't normally spend the Ching on many games. . This has a different take of an old favorite.  But none of the challenge levels are working on my game.  Once it's over, nothing happens.  I don't get credit for work achieved and I have to restart with same result. A glitch. Waiting for update",
        "Love these games. I've purchased them all from different sagas. I'm just encountering a  problem with this one in particular. At the end of every challenge it glitches and I can't get my rewards. It stays on the challenge and I have to go back to the menu and play again. Pretty frustrating. Hoping it can be resolved.",
        "It was great except for the adds of course. waste of time. I got to lvl 60 after playing lvl 60 it will just close and crush. please help! is level 60 the last level? y am is the app crushing??"

        "Great game, very addictive! But a lot of hackers in the game, making the game unfair. Hackers usually performs: 1 shot kill Goes under ground and kill you while you can't shoot back Unlimited health See through obstacles I hope the game developers would update and get rid of those hacks",

No complaints graphics are better than rules of survival, less stuff to pick up, but smoother game play, instant match making 90% of the time, great community, constant improvements, very very happy with this game. Spending money has no point other than style and bragging rights no effect on in game play.",

I have played this game for a little while now and I stay up late playing it, I never stay up late, well never had a reason to, until now!😂😁This game is amazing, if you are looking at the reviews for this I would definitely recommend this game, it is soooo much fun! I would like to add to my review, the maintenance takes forever, and sometimes it will go well over the projected time. Sometimes for hours. I know it says subject to change but it's kind of annoying when you want to play and when it's after the time it makes me mad. So please if you can, make your predictions more accurate.",

And I rate this game a five because how it's made, but it can also help you learn we're to put the coin to get amazing prizes. This game could be a good practice for people that just like to play these games, you know?",

        "Loved this. Played 5 days straight.Many MANY hours! Just to reach Level 62 , wake up the next day and EVERYTHING WAS GONE?!? The WHOLE game started over. What REALLY ticks me off is that Ive spent REAL MONEY in this game!!! I refuse to start over. I literally played 24-7.  So unfortunately I've uninstalled it.  If this didnt happen I would of gave it 5 stars. Every 1 in my house has UNISTALLED!",
        "Ok, if you want 16 ads in 3 minutes (yes, I stopped and counted them!) Then this is the perfect game for you. Watch as you get 3 seconds away from getting a new shimey coin, to only have an ad pop up and reset your counter. This game really isn't worth it. Save your time and go play something else.",
        "Although I'm addicted I'm seriously considering uninstalling the app. I completed a task to receive over 250 free dozer dollars last week and still have yet to receive them. I even sent feed back about this issue and never received a reply. What a rip off! Why have the option if they don't honor it?",
        "Got this app to get something for a different game but I'm giving up because it will take too long. Constant ads in the middle of gameplay ruin this game. I understand having ads but there are way too many and they pop up in inconvenient times."

I frowned, I smiled and laughed. Would like to see more than a number for IQ. Maybe in a basic way what skills I'm good at or need work on. It's all so enjoyable; not paying attention to skill building. I'm telling everyone about this game!",

I figured out how to  shake the small pumpkin but it insisted i wasn't  holding the big one. As well as the chemical mix. Fun to play with friends.  Wish it had a challenge mode. Definitely needs more questions",

U have to think out of the box with this game. \"EVERYTHING\" on the screen is fair game when figuring out the problems. Use your voice, shake the phone, etc. Think creatively!

        "Good game.  Great graphics.  Fun to play.  I dont have a  problem with saving my game progress.  With the last update yesterday, theres a glitch with 5he starting pitching. Its not going through the rotation. My number 1 starter has pitched 3 in a row. I change pitcher, exit game, save it, then load it up, and again my number 1 starter is in.... ???",
        "Money pit. Only a few outcomes on any swing, most are just fly balls. You can literally throw 100% change ups down the middle and it's no different than actually trying to pitch. Swinging has no effect. If you level up your team at all the computer teams become massive all-stars that are unbeatable",
        "The game is super fun to play. I love that it is offline so you don't have to worry about data. There are some ads but they don't get in the way. My only complaint is that the batting mechanic seems a little off, you need to swing basically after the ball is already past you to get a hit. Took me a while to get the timing down. Overall great game though.",
        "Good system for the league with all those stats and easy to get new player if you keep winning. One problem for free cp & card  is that it does not have any ads (installing 2 times, save cloud is ok and in app purchase is ok, just no ads at all). Idk if it is my network provider (3 mobile) blocked it since i don't use any vpn or ad blocking stuff. And i want cute speaker like the announcer in high school kōshien/mlb calling the batter name and position, but the most important is you don't make the pinch runner option!",
        "Love the game. Hard to read stats on gray background, especially on cell phones. White would be better, maybe. Also, where do you go to \"equip\" your team? Purchased a uniform change but can't find where to implement it.  But I am addicted to this fun game. Well done.",
        "Caught out literally every turn. Ok game but sucks the fun out of it. Also I could have like all the bases filled get caught out and they all get out. Hate it...."

However, players should not have to pay to get gold bars from piggy bank especially since the player has already \"paid for them\" by earning them on levels. Players should be able to use them once earned.",
        "This is ridiculous! I was on level 1034 and had tons of color bombs fish striped candy and etc. I thought since I was pretty far in the game I would finally click the Facebook save your progress option. What a mistake that was!  I logged into my Facebook only to lose completely everything and start over from level 1! Why would it say \"save your progress\" when it totally doesn't save your current progress! I've been playing this game longer than any other game and now I can't even get all my rewards i have saved over time. This is ridiculous!",
        "I think Candy Crush as well as Jelly and Soda crush are very entertaining games with literally thousands of levels to play. The levels are imaginative with different scenarios so they don't become boring. So as an avid player of these games I would give them a 4 out of 5 stars because there are some levels that can freeze your progress and become frustrating. All in all, keep up the great ideas for future games.",
        "I like the game, very challenging.  However, I had accidentally uninstalled it & King staff told me to reinstall & I would be at the level when uninstall occurred, which was true, but on previous game I had earned unlimited lives, so now I am timed out.  Can you fix & give me back earned unlimited lives?  Thanks, Arlene",

I thought this was a good game for children but if you make it to hard for them then they will not want to play it.",

Need more transport holes or vases and plants to hide behind. So many great comments, it's baffling to me.  Wish I  knew the tricks to get as far as a lot of the reviewers do.  Looks like it COULD BE A FUN GAME, but in present form, it's too challenging for me.  Bummer. Guess I'll have to uninstall it.",
        "I really like this game, it's fun and retro but still has that old school flow from the show. It's easy and difficult at the same time and that keeps it interesting",
        "Game is good but it has some bad spots in it for instance like a sandwich with mouldy spots. I waited this 2 toms and it was all because there was too much times and it was too much bad really😒🙁☹️"

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

It's nice to always be able to recharge your stamina through ads. I hope updates come and also limited decals. One drawback and a fix needed is losing the stuff you paid for when you change the item.",
        "Would be better if you were placed in matched based not only on your discs but also on the levels of your band. I shouldn't get a perfect score and STILL lose because their passive is higher than mine but they made more mistakes. Also maybe up the sensitivity? it seems like the system doesn't quite pick up on my tapping  which causes me to miss notes. Graphics are nice and the spin offs are good.",
        "This game is pretty addicting the songs are short & sweet, the songs are not original songs but have a similar sound to the original ones, and are named differently too. The only thing that kinda sucks are the ads which you have to pay to remove & that the band runs on stamina. So if your band runs out of stamina you have to wait several minutes before you could play again but other than that I really like it and it has that guitar hero feeling to it .."

        "There was a time when you can still feel the dev team's gratitude for you choosing their game. But now, its just one paywall after another. Whatever they used to give for free in the past years, they've found a way to turn into cashcrop. I've never been closer to deleting this game than when the latest update came out. If you're not a VIP, uninstall it now. They've made a fool out of us.",
        "Well I have played this game from the beginning. And it has been a solid game. The evolution of the game has been astounding for the most part. I have had my ups and downs with it over the years. Yet overall it has been the one game I could never fully quit. I have taken my time from the game a few times. But, every time I come back. It feels as fresh and new as the first time I logged in. And in the world of micro-transactions, Netmarble has been one the most generous companies out there. Thanks for making a solid, fun game featuring characters I grew up reading and loving.",
        "Well previously I rated this 1* But after almost 2 years I thought to give it another try and I am amazed to see they made this game so worthy finally u can have 4 5 6 star characters without any hassle. Hats off to the team. Thank u since I loved the game  when I played it for the first time. But then I was very difficult to level up get higher star players but now it is.",
        "An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn't thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that's what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can't get bored of it.",
        "Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don't already have this, stay away.",
        "This is probably the best Marvel game out there and my favourite game. If you are into Marvel and superheros I would highly recommend it. I know people say that it's bad because of some of the characters require money to get but these characters don't compare to some of the free ones so you will be able to get have a good experience without paying. Some parts of the game can be a bit of a grind but I find that fun. I have enjoyed this game so much that I am tempted to spend a little bit of money just because I am enjoying the game so much (I never spend money on games) In conclusion I would really recommend this game for all ages if you have any interest in superheros. There are some characters I would like to see in the game and hopefully they will be added in future updates."

Pls make that its a cool game you must make it cooler.I like very much this game and add a basket sport and a fire bomb that remains on the floor for 5 seconds and how enters the fire area burns.And add the fire in normal maps to stay for ever there and ki kill the guys that are running in to it. Update this game is the best game in the world. :D",
        "Occasional connection drops, and the pain of inviting friends to a party should be made simpler. Also add voice chat. And make text chat more convenient. Keep adding maps and modes! And what is it with the 30 second long ads?",
        "Wow after that update there's barely any lag at all. The server list doesn't jitter uncontrollably either and if there was lag in the server rooms then it would only be minor. I'm loving this update and I already bought grumbledorf the wizard hes hilarious.",
        "I loved it but in servers of other player lags very much. Please fix this  and add some more equipments like reaper,invisibility......😃😃. When i join the server , it tells that server is full while it shows there is 2/8, 6/18  and many more but while playing instantly i left server. I don't know what is happening 😓😓😓",
        "Eric I have a great suggestion for you. I don't know if it's possible or not but can you add Haptic Feedback for Bluetooth Controllers which support vibrations. Is that possible? 🤔",
        "👍 loved it .  But when I play online I can't get a fair fight because of the hackers. They use mod apk and they cheat in the game. Makers of the bomb squad I request you to do something about this please 🙏"

Still love this game, thank you. Could you possibly make it an option to turn off the extended day upgrade?",

There are so many casually wholesome moments throughout it, like a homeless man will come in once in a while and you can decide if you'll give him pizza even though he can't pay. There's people of different sizes, races, cultures. I would die if the game makers made a version of this game but in a coffee shop",

After turning my phone back on, I now can't open the app. When I click on the shortcut, it opens up a black screen for a few seconds and then exits it the app completely and I get a notification saying \"Pizza has stopped\" it's done this a dozen or so times now even after waiting a day. I would just uninstall and reinstall, but I'm scared I'll lose my progress. If my progress is saved to my Google play account, will I be able to get it back?",
        "I loved this game. But the new update ruined it the experience. For example I didn't saved monies for helping hands to wait for my instructions when spreading the sausage/pep/cheese etc. It was better the way before as it showed some intelligent hand.",
        "I used to really love this game but the difficulty of the game is a little ridiculous. It would really help if the customers who didn't like the pizza say what was wrong with it so I could know what to fix."

Often you will come across players with incredible records like 95% wins, yet they can't hit more than an 8 even once. If I enter Online Mode I want to play against real players, not AI.",
        "It's not bad, but you will have to play for about 3 years before you can use the female character.  Also, after the first 2 levels your bow will no longer work so you will have to buy a new bow. Problem is you are going to find yourself several thousand dollars short so you will have to keep replaying the same levels or spend actual cash.",

        "Amazing game if you like naval warships. UPDATE: As of Feb 17 2018, the new update has seriously increased the game content and fun level. UPDATE as of Feb 27 2018, Lowered my rating to 4 stars because there is a constant issue with the timers or something like that.  I login and collect the crate and start a module upgrading then login several hours late and is like no time elapsed in the game from the last time I logged in. This has happened several times in the past as well.",
        "This is a fantastic game one of the best by miles. I am not sure however, that the latest update was such a success. Prior to update the smaller torpedo boats had a good chance now that dynamic has been removed by the dominance of the larger ships firepower and slow reload times on torpedoes.  This means that the strategic component has been somewhat diminished",
        "Addicting but not worth it. Everywhere in the game there are a bunch of Russian POS hackers. You can have a fully upgraded Battleship and a little tiny Destroyer or frigate will come along and one shot it with a main cannon from half the map away. This should not be possible. I tried using fully upgraded versions of Destroyers and frigates and I couldn't even scratch a normal battleship. As long as the Russian POS hackers aren't playing this game it's not worth it.",
        "Definitely a good game and worth your time and money. Only issue that developers really need to attend to is how they select the team. You can't have 7 ships of high ranks against 5 or 4 ships of low rank. It makes a person want to delete the game even after spending money on it. Keep same ranked players together in a battle. Really irritating.",
        "Ok there are alot of fun things about the game, the controls are good and the ships look great, cash shop is reasonably priced and you can grind up ftp if like. Now if your new and are thinking of buying a ship? Just buy a BB or Battleship. Everyone plays them because 1. There's no smoke and 2. There are several maps but none are objective based so.. Yeah it's a turkey shoot where positioning and teamwork DOES count but in the end the BBs just over power every thing. Now if they add some capture the flag on bigger maps which requires speed or smoke so smaller ships can hide.. Gets 5 stars.",
        "Addicting can't seem to put it down. I recommend it, I love everything about it, gameplay, graphics, controls and smooth. Only thing though guys is the ships give us more to rent as a beginner, the ships given at first are no match for any of the ships and you don't get much to buy upgrades. Gives something that we can at least have a chance, other than that love the game, (GOOD WORK!!!)"

        "I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn't that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven't played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!",
        "It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don't have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I'll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.",
        "Best Game Ever! I love this game because the animated animatronics like toy Bonnie he trys his best to hug you. Example: mum is that you? Mum I love you!  The chicken is so weird she has a beak on the stage but when she is at cam 7 in the hallway she has no beak, why is that? Toy Freddie is quite scary but he kind of looks like a stuffed teddy bear instead of an animatronic. Well I love this game thanks for the game Scott Cawthon!",
        "Creepy and super scary game! Wow!  This games is so awesome and fantastic because it does not log on my cellphone and so scary game!  My 2 nephew are having fun  with this game and actually when the time now is 3 am and the animatronics is going to move, they're so tense to watch the cctv because they will see chica the color yellow  bird looking at the camera!  So I give 5 stars to this game and to the Creator of this game.. keep the good work creating a game!  😊😉",
        "This is the best game! Its way better than the first game because there's more anamictronics! Moreover instead of doors you get the hall and vents also you have to flash your light at foxy to get him away. You also have a mask to make chica,boany,mango,balloons boy, and Freddy. Mary and net is creepy as hell because she's kinda like Freddy in the first one like I mean she comes at you randomly like Freddy in the last one.",
        "Cool but... It will only allow me to play on my phone and I want to also play on my laptop but when I try to download it on my laptop it says its already downloaded on my phone i dont know how to download FNaF on my laptop D: Can you please make a download for laptops/computers? I wanna try it on my laptop (I have a feeling its gunna be scarier than my phone cuz its bigger screen than my phone O.O) Please make a download for laptops and I will rate 5 stars  and it also shows on the screen there's night 5 but in game 1"

        "I've been playing on and off since the 2nd year anniversary. All around this game is awesome.  I would love more ways to grind for dragon stones tho. I'm happy to pay for them when i can but working for them is always better.  I have a couple requests. Since you're bringing back old events. Can we have the one for Epic Battle! Arise, Otherworld Challengers medals. I would love to finally dokkan awaken super saiyan goku (angel) (super kaioken)  Also, is there a way we could get notifications when certain items like medals are on sale/ in Baba's shop?",
        "Nothing but a cash grab wrapped in Dragon Ball. You cannot play this game long term without sinking in big $$$, don't waste your time. I would know, I've played since release. The good cards on banners have less than a 1% drop rate and one multisummon (10 cards) is about $30... not worth it, be smart and play something else.",
        "A great game many things to do. Very fun if you like dragon ball. Can be a little to hard if you don't want to buy dragon stones. I don't really know where else to write this but I have been having a problem with the evil emperor of the universe event. At the end of the event it says it gave me medals and in inventory it says I have more than enough medals, but when I go to awaken a character it says I don't have any. Please help",
        "I've been playing this game since it first came out I even have a jp account this game is by far the greatest of all time that I myself have ever played. With this game I get to use some of my favorite characters of all time and one of my most recent acquired cards Goku Black rose which is also my favorite villain of all time. This game gives great experience and fun to whomever is the player. Spectacular Game Bandai! I can't wait to summon on the new super vegito banner wish me luck:).",
        "Somethings that would be nice LR reverse medals that revert LR's to thier base form so you can unlock thier potential easier. More ways to unlock medals like maybe some kind special treasurer where you can juts buy any medals. More LR's. There are far to many borly's so plz stop adding more. These are just a few nitpics but I like the game",
        "The Game is amazing . No glitches. ,story line fits perfectly,  there is nothing wrong with the in game and the gameplay of it. The only trouble I am having recently all day is that the downloading on the recent update is not workibg. Im standing right next to my internet box and it says my internet is Excellent. But every time i try to download this game it is just saying. \"Download Fail\" Please fix"

        "Great game. Simple and fun. Some awesomely hard ones and some I didn't know I knew. Especially like the achievement and leaderboard. A way to save progress would be good as I've reset my phone a few times and lost progress.",
        "Several times now I've tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn't see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",
        "Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn't take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I'm wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don't know some of the logos what is the point of the game.",
        "It's too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I'd like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.",
        "My 6 year old son is really enjoying doing this with me! Just a little frustrating with the American logos that we're not so sure on!"

        "The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.",
        "It's rare I would spend money on a game for my phone but on this one I tried.  Good news is I saved the money and didn't because I can't.  I wanted to buy gems to get the goblin and the store isn't working the customer support links don't work and the main reason for the bad  review is because I emailed them and never heard back. Hate to think how they would treat us after they get our money if the customer service is this bad before they get it.",
        "This game is a solid mix of \"clash of clans\" and \"fallout shelter\". Just like COC, you have to learn to let the timers cool off. The long term time investment can be very rewarding. The questing/pvp is also well done considering you can't choose what to attack or when during battle. Wholeheartedly a good game.",
        "Would be a great game if it wasn't blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can't defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don't get attacked too much and lose all your resources.",
        "This is cheat to win, honest people paying still loose  There are so many people cheating, especially the top in clan. they all cheat and use scripts and developer company doesn't even care, they just care rip off more money, and cheaters owns in this game and all the resources. Developers keep those cheaters around just force regular people to pay more money",
        "Tournaments are terrible if you have 500k power 90% of people in the tournoment will have 800k power . If you have 600k others have 900k. I played 136 tournaments and only won 3rd place 3 times and 90% of the time i was 10+ (from 14 people) . Absolutely pay to win. But still fun"

Materials like axes, nails and things needed to upgrade the barn and silo are not so hard to obtain. An easy game so far. I draw back there is no way to back up your progress in the game. This needs to be fixed quickly.",
        "Before anything, this is only a game you can only play a couple of minutes an hour due to time limits on making stuff.  As you level up you'll find that it's impossible to keep up with the game. I'm level 21 and still can't afford things from level 17, I need about 10x the money I currently have to buy everything I've unlocked. I also pretty much have hit storage limits from day 1, and although you can raise those limits, you can never quite stay on par with everything you need.",
        "Glitches quite frequently... You receive one diamond for each level you achieve, yet an axe cost three diamonds to remove trees.. You shouldn't need a new axe to cut trees.. Every tree cost you an axe, every axe cost three diamonds.. Very costly game..",
        "Very addictive game, play it every day. Game fails to load, reported it in app, it's been 10 days and still no response to fix it. I'm on level 65 and no way to backup data. Please fix asap. Waiting patiently.",
        "Keeps shutting off. Can't collect gems because it freezes up. I have updated game twice but nothing new has been added to the game. Now it says game is not loading to send report. I have three times but no code has been sent. PLEASE send code.",

        "I love this game! Best dogfight ever! Just a few request... Add a desert map, and it's like a sandstorm where there's dunes and little bases for offline mode, and add the dunes map for online but no buildings, or add them I don't know! And on offline mode, make it to where the enemies actually hurt you, I never get damaged unless I hit the water or objects, and last. Please make the landing an aircraft carrier ship, and they can shoot misses, (no lock on) and shoot the little turrets, because the planes, and game are perfectly modern, but the airship you land on, is too futuristic... If you love that idea of the futuristic ship, make a Futuristic Warplanes, and you can make your own planes too! And the new game, will get your own maps too! Anyways, thanks for reading, keep up the great work!!!!!",
        "Great game, great graphics! Needs some things  -like weapon/plane descriptions (just some text to show you what you are getting, maybe make it a bit educational) -definately a campaign -make offline mode at least a bit challenging... now you just farm forever until you get bored. Not ideal... make enemies shoot you at least!",
        "Great game overall but I'd like to see some more game modes and a fix to the camera. It glitches out after a few minutes of in every watch and makes it impossible to play. I'll change my rating once I notice a fix.",
        "Inbuilt missile of F-35 can't even hot simple planes like F-16. It contain third class missiles in side even after being so costly in game... Please put some accurate missiles in f35 it missed 9 out of 10 times.... Waste of time",
        "The game is Great! Awesome graphics, and the gameplay is great. It's available offline and that makes it almost perfect, just that it's only one mode when you play offline, which is Survival, it gets boring playing only that mode offline, there should be more stuff for offline. The controls is just Good, it can be Great though! Like add another control modes.. Maybe like a one where it's me who shoots with the cannon instead of automatically shooting! I admit it's gonna be harder but most important that it's gonna be Challenging and more realistic, I hope you guys consider my suggestions, especially the controls thing.  But yeah the game is Amazing overall, keep it up.",
        "This game has so much potential. Add More maps, fix some minor bugs like F-15's landing gear should be hidden during dogfights. And another, Please match the player levels in multiplayer Mode. I mean com'on , im on a tomcat and my opponent is in a higher level plane."

Poor performing car, even maxed out, with playing previous races the only way to make money, and you don't make enough, it will take a long time to purchase the second car, because in the previous races you'll keep getting the same result.  Go ahead, download this garbage, you'll see what I mean.",

        "Nice graphics and low size but the game is tottaly money oriented. One cannot buy car easily and race bonus is too low plus to get nitro one has to pay money in $s to get.. so it is difficult to clear levels. I am only giving it 5 star because it gives me money and nitro boosts.. can't buy cars easily though",

I just wished they put more into everything else beisdes the graphics. Also its full of way too many ads and in-app purchases. I also have to say, the reviews on here are either fake or someone who doesn't speak English used google translate is unfortunately not smart enough to realize this is a terrible game that had no effort put into it."

        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "There are too many ads it's a game to enjoy the advertisements  I think . But while playing it's good but after we do a single there is a ad and then we do the second nail there is another ad . Please fix this Budge Studios . But no like this game and it is a four star because there are too many ads and also we can't create our own design adding stickers as we can do in match this side",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

No death by ads or even annoying ads (there are some btw), plenty of resource freebies especially healthy amounts of in game currency (which some upgrades rely on), it's hours of fun.

        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed.",
        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you've collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!"

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars",
        "This is really hard. I can't buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible",
        "This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control's are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although…                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads…ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It’s still great!"

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",
        "Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can't understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It's mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It's mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",
        "Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "Fun game but janky/sketchy ads. The ads will unmute your device and turn up the volume before they play, over and over again, so you can't\u200b play the game anywhere quiet. The \"x\" button on the ads is not in the right position, so tapping it doesn't close the ad and you have to hunt for the hidden close button. Bunch of the ads never load and just show a empty gray screen.",
        "My problem with the gane comes from some sort of bug that started like an ad mid-run, then it started doing some weird rainbow pattern that flipped 90 degrees every few seconds. Now the game doesnt function when you try to start a run and the problem even persisted to my home screen before I closed the application."

        "Super Fun While it doesn't have the  best graphic, the gameplay is super fun!  It takes practices to defeat opponents with more stats than you,  but once you master it you'll get addicted to the game. The control is somewhat simple yet engaging. Only one thing is missing: feature to duel with your friends via Bluetooth!",
        "Ummm can u add the P-Joker and P-Thunder sets? I really like those and please open up the event league so that other players can get the cool items and to those people who say everything is pretty expensive in Punch Hero, Jeez you guys really don't have patience. I am still playing this game today because I am inspired to get the move set I wanted and I hope the P-Joker and P-Thunder sets will be coming. Thanks! ArtoriasAbyss",
        "Was my all time favorite Played this game for years...uninstalled and reinstalled many times just to start over agian and build up a new guy.  There are ways/tricks to earn money faster without spending any REAL money and once you learn those tricks this game is one of the best ones out there; however, No Events or daily bonus??????...come on guys you're better then this!!!  What's the deal!?!??",
        "Lack of customization, high replay value Feels like Mike Tyson's Punchout. The player customization is far limited. You're pretty much stuck with the most generic looking fighter for a long long time before you can buy upgrades with in-game money. The gameplay, however is pretty fun. The counter system is what makes the fights exciting. A great action sports game that needs more flexibility in fighter creation.",
        "Doesn't work anymore Hey, as good as I know this game is its been at least 3-4 years since the last time I played this game. Everything that I ever did on there is lost because I can't access the game anymore. I love this game so much it would mean a lot to me if you guys figure out why I can't play Punch Hero.",
        "Deuce Bigalow I love this game. I had hit on my HTC One M7 . I bought a Samsung Galaxy j7. The only problem I have is that it freezes up at the beginning. I have to restart the game 4 - 5 times. Once it starts it plays fine. I did not have this problem with my HTC. I love this game!! can you please put a patch on it. So it will work on my a Galaxy j7. Or maybe some advice to get past the beginning screen."

And some items I've purchased don't work it gives a message saying they couldn't find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT",
        "I love this game!! \"it helps a lot\" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I'm buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))",
        "I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.",
        "Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.",
        "I love this game.  The only home design game there is. Glad that that they have added items to the shelves more realistic.  Sometimes I feel it is over designed.  I wouldn't always add that footstool or bench.  It is also difficult to play without spending money and I cannot afford to do that.  Keys are required to decorate properly (plants, decor) and can take a long time to accumulate.  This is my favourite game though and I will continue to play and patiently wait just do my best with what I have.  I do watch the videos to gain more keys but woe is me...",
        "Great game! Love it! Only voting system is not accurate. I think  designs that not reflecting the theme should not get  5 stars. It would be nice to have experts inside the game who will review designs for THEME and reward those who follow the theme and get great result  in designing. I suggest to  give one point for those who is following theme, and get one point out if someone not. Fairness is important."

        "Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn't mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.",
        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",
        "My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.",
        "I'm only on level 1 wrong so correct me if im wrong but I thought the game was a bit boring at first and the game doesn't seem to give you much choice andyou have to folow what it says but if you enjoy the game thats great! I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D",
        "I absolutely love the game,  but I have one question. ...why is it called \"talking hank\"? Hank doesn't say a freaking word!!! I realize that it's a spin off of \"talking tom\", it's just an observation and is a little annoying. .. otherwise GREAT, GREAT GAME."

        "Would have been better if you guys increased the regen time of the stamina. I always have nothing to do after I run out of stamina. No energy. Lots of things you can do. Please fix that. I would love if the chicken event can give more than 50 energy and please do the chicken event at least 3 times a day. Also, I am not fan of the guild quest where you have to mandatory do pk. Can you give an option where I can do guild quest without going into a pk map? Even if there will be lower rewards, I'll pick that over pk anytime. I like how you adapt the design, character, and even the bgm from luna online pc version. That game was the first mmorpg that I've played and it has a special place in my heart. Hope to see more improvements. Thank you and nice job :)",
        "I dont really have something to say about this game cause i havent played it yet.. why? cause it always forces to stop and says \"has stopped\", i already tried re-installing the game but still nothing change:( .. plsss fix this.. i really want to play this game.. need info fr this problem...",
        "Hmmm. What to say first? The game is amazing and the graphic is so cool. The storyline of the game itself is interesting and nice.... But there is one thing. My account is missing after one day. I repeat one day. I log in at server 31 and the next day I relogin and I have to make a new character in another server because server 31 is missing! I played many hours and my level and buddies are so many already. I decided to uninstall the app.",
        "A decent mobile mmorpg. It's dungeon-based for now (since developer is looking ways to make it an open world), but there are plenty of things to do to keep the players busy for awhile. The in-game rewards are aplenty enough, so the game can be played without the need to pay (but that's just personal preference).",
        "I like the game. The character and graphic are cute. What i dont like is that this is another pay to win games :(. Please make less server, it is just matter of time when the player is decreasing and every server only left some players. Even now it is hard to find active members for guild.",
        "I haven't played the Luna on PC, so i don't really know much. I am enjoying my time, the skills are amazing and the animations are amazing too. Played with high graphics setting but experienced no lag. Cute characters, various designs of armor and weapon, and a lot of features. I just don't like the auto battle. Overall it got me."

        "Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I'd rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.",
        "This game should be really good. It has all the components of an excellent puzzle game.   However, there are WAY too many ads. Am ad after every level, completed or failed, it's excessive. To make matters worse, some of those ads play sound even if you have disabled sound in the game!   Improve the ad problem, and you are looking at a much higher rating.",
        "Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you're aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.",
        "Everything has been great till about 1 month ago when the graph is slowed downed. After you start off there's delays in the line of balls and very unsettling it's not continuous anymore.",
        "Game has so much potential and is a blast. I'm giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to \"use 200 gems to remove 3 lines\" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow",

The diamonds are a little bit too rare to get and since half the updates are priced with diamonds the end result is each location doesn't get 100% upgraded, witch is a little bit frustrating. I love that when you revisit a level it's slightly different, makes it much more interesting. It's a lovely little game, kudos to the developers and designers!",

One thing that would be nice was to have the option to fast forward especially with times when you're just waiting for customers or the elderly ladies to finish shopping. Also an endless challenging round would be awesome. Thanks =)",
        "Very slow gameplay with little challenge. Tasks end up feeling more like chores, especially the \"special\" characters that don't shop. You're forced to do each plodding level five times for a chance to earn Gold. Significant upgrades cost diamonds - which you mostly get from reaching Gold, which means a lot of slow grinding. If you're new to the genre it'll probably suit. If you're not, it'll probably be boring.",
        "1. This should have an UNLIMITED LIVES option. The stages per level are unenjoyably difficult enough --why do you have to limit the player's chance to try and be better?? Some levels are impossible for human fingers already.  2. You should lessen the required number of diamonds as value of items to upgrade!!! A player only gets 9 diamonds per level achieved. 10 gems per upgrade is ok, but 50??? FIX THIS ASAP or people will be deleting this app.",
        "I always love supermarket mania. I played supermarket mania 1 and 2 and expect great things for this. But, no, this game infuriates me. The pace is really slow and the customer stream is to long. More over, it use diamonds for essential upgrades like cashier (why should i upgrade cashier??) and cart. Grinding diamonds is a pain in the ass. I think the developer only think of making money than make this game enjoyable to it's player.",
        "I like this game but it needs to give better options earn Crystal's and it should not cost you as many if any at all to move to next level. I play a lot of games and don't mind spending a few dollars but now I'm turned off from it. Yall need to do better. I Won't suggest it to any of my friends for that reason alone."

        "Deleted my gplus page for many reasons! Unfortunately! The only way i can officially save my game progress and be able to back it up? Is to sign in hence the gplus pop up! I'm on the fence. This game is not bad at all.....so far. We'll see! I can't wait too long to decide though! A new series has a time limit, Thanks for that!",
        "why do u keep showing use pictures of cars that have decals and graffiti on them even though we can't put decals or car skins on are car in the mod shop I t even shows on the picture that says tons of customisation with a car with graffiti but no in mod shop there's no decals its just solid colors? :( why? I still like game though I just hope u add that",
        "Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won't reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.",
        "Special episodes are impossible to win. Final episodes includes more than 14 races, a day is 24 hours and we slept about 8 hours. So we need to be on alert and play each hour without losing. Make them a little bit easier or make 5 tickets price 30 golds not 90.",
        "The game is absolutely stunning.. great graphics and smooth gameplay.. the races are short, but I'm okay with that being a phone game.. BUT the game is very difficult to actually unlock the \"fun\" cars.. you have to play day and night to even get the basic cars somewhat decent, and the higher end cars you will never drive unless you spend tons of money... don't get me wrong, I believe in paying to keep a game alive, but their price structure is literally insane.. no way I'm spending over $100 on a phone game when there are console versions cheaper.. might have to stop playing soon bc races are getting out of reach"

First off all the songs are barely sounding like the actual songs..eg linkin park..Numb..You couldnt even guess what song that was Second i wanna complain about some notes when u press them and they dont have a sound and u think that u didnt press it so u double tap it and ruin your high score..this one rlly bugs me Third off all the bonus coins that u get after 3 stars..this isnt the biggest thing that annoys me but why is it that if u press a wrong key then u lose if its the bonus points... Thats all I have to say",

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",
        "This is game is ok if you are bored and don't know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game",
        "I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat",
        "It is a great and fun game. Challenging and it works on your patience and timing. However it deleted all my progress for some reason and I lost all of the obstacles I unlocked, which was a lot",
        "This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you"

        "I think it OK I like it. I just think you should go through and check the words again. A few words were miss spelt for example HAPPENED HAS 1 N and SEDUCTION doesn't have a K also AUSTRALIA has 1 L. I found a few other words but can't remember them all. Just go through and check but beside that it's a great idea for a game cause it gets the mind going well done.🖒",
        "Words are a bit too easy. They're ok if you're learning English but for us English speakers they're too simple. I suppose though it depends on whether you're a good speller or not. Still, it'd keep me amused whilst sitting on a bus or a train. It IS  a very good way to begin learning English though. 4 stars if there were more variety. Ye the ads are a damn nuisance. It's true it's a speed thing more than a spelling test. So if you're ancient, like me, it Does help the ol brain box think faster.",
        "Way too many ads, for one thing. Also, since I'm a pretty good speller and move through the various games rather quickly, I feel that the listed \"Top 20\" scores are unrealistic, some reaching 5 to 6 figures. Can someone explain this to me?",
        "It is the ever best game of mine. We can learn here many things . Before exam or test all the teachers regularly saying that you must learn all the difficult spellings.  It will help us . So my appeal to all the people who want to make their brain very intelligent  . So please install this attractive game .",
        "Not bad. Confusing Leaderboard tho. Have to actually move your eye muscles to look for the right name or time of when you played.  Damn I sound like my brother!!",
        "It is a fun game, in fact the game ideas are phenomenal. However, the ads pop up while I am actually playing the game. To top that off, every time I try to go back to the games, it repeats the previous game I did or goes into another ad and freezes at the end. Removing the game for those reasons."

        "Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don't lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates",
        "This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there's no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.",
        "This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!"

        "This game is OK. I played it for a couple of weeks now and I was wondering if you could put auto switch on, because you have to keep switching until you reach your player and then you try to block there shots but it's too late. I've lost about 50 games because it's hard to tell who your player is. But if you just put auto switch on ill rate it 5 stars and I'll be happy. Thanks anyway☺",
        "Great game! Really a Great game, bu not the greatest?  You know why? But please read my suggestions. First, add a players hair so we can easily recognize them, second add game stats with their names, add crossovers too, and some smooth moves. But yess! ! I like thia game, more improvements djnworks(sorry thatsb wrong). More power!! Rock n' Roll!! 😊😊",
        "Its a Great game no doubt about it but like everytime I shoot a 3 pointer I hold down on shoot and it shoots too fast and air balls. The controls are just too sensitive. And there needs to be less Ads and pls add names to them and not anything else BC that would ruin the point of the stickman series. But other than all of that well done.",
        "It's pretty fun. Great time killer. Usually, with these types of games, the first game is amazing and the sequel is trash. You guys definitely did a good job keeping consistent with the games, and they're both amazing. Just don't make it so easy to go out of bounds, or make the courts bigger. That's all from me. Keep it up!😃",
        "Great game nice and simple and lots of fun. Is way too easy to shoot 3s and just win every time, even on hard difficulty and with low rated teams, maybe make 3s harder to hit? Would love a shot percentage and a chance to play against friends, and also maybe a intercepts/turnover stat as well.  Also cant seem to the '4 controllers' multiplayer. Just the pass and play - party play?  5/5",
        "It fun I mean I like it, and I'm happy they finally made an updated basketball game. The only thing about it is I don't like how the whole team celebrates after EVERY shot made. That's not very real. But besides that love it. I gave it 4 stars cause I'm still waiting for them to make a baseball game. #JustSayin"

        "I know this will get lost in the review section... But this game is amazing! I work with special needs children and they accomplish advanced skills just for the reward of playing this game! The animations, the graphics, the game play is beautiful. Following the bananas is easy enough for some of the kiddos, while some just like to watch me play. Either way, this game is helping children accomplish goals, is a great time passed for me, and while in app purchases are cool, they are certainly not necessary! A+ :)",
        "Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won't do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.",
        "I have a Xiaomi Redmi 4 mobile with 3 GB RAM, 1.4 GHz Octa Core. Still Game hangs, Speed enhanced with a jerk every time and then it dies. I have reset my mobile and reinstalled it but the problem still there. It's very annoying. Otherwise I love this game. It's very addictive.",
        "Love this game ..I am been hooked with this game since years .however wanted to highlight I am currently in Level 346 Residential area where the task is to use slides 5 times to go to next level. However I have played that level so many times and found that Residential area doesn't have slides ...is this a bug ? How do we overcome it"

        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks",
        "I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "I like this game, it's so cool, but, whenever you have to leave the match, it punishes you for leaving the game! You loose trophy's. So you can't leave the game if you don't want to lose trophys. Sometimes we often have to leave the game because other important stuff get in the way or our moms are saying that we need to get off. Having a punishment for leaving the game is the most unfair and cruel rule in this game. There shouldn't be a rule of punishment because they think if you leave the game, you are a sore loser. This needs to change, because we are not all sore losers when we leave the game Pixel Gun 3D!",
        "Overall this is a great game but before i give it 5 stars you really need to fix a bug the matchmaking system. It keeps matching me up against a team who is almost 10 levels higher than my own, which means they get more health and have better weapons. This is making it really unfair.",
        "This game has some faults (microtransactions and pay to win) but overall is amazing. Doesn't need a powerful phone to play, can occupy you for hours, and can help you meet new people. I got this game a month ago and haven't stopped playing since. This is one of my favorite games of all time, over all devices and consoles. I highly encourage you to download this game if you enjoy minecraft-styled graphics and multiplayer fps. And surprisingly there is a truck load of customization: Clan Forts, Home Base, Skin Editor, Armor, Weapons, and Pets. Sandbox has lots of toxicity but is tolerable. Overall 10/10 and a must-get for try hards and casual gamers alike."

Rather if u keep some hard challenge i can complete but this got stuck on some stage where i have to buy to go furthere...   You should change your compulsive policy on purchases...   Would like to stick further and play more...",
        "Dear my cafe Can you make more level? And more more ideas like you guys can make more people who walk around.. Or you guys make it easy to create a new town.. We should be vip 3? That's mean we need pay.. Make it easier please.  And you guys really made the best game ever.. Keep working for more idea's please🔥✔",
        "Um, Its a cute game. It is an.okay game to play. But certain thing can be change. When its festival time you can only play one task at a time. I think that stupid because sometimes you don't have all the ingredients or spices for a task you have chosen, but you ended up having other ingredients for another task. But the only way , you can choose that other task if you quit your current one in which you have work hard and also you loose 50 diamond's for that. Not fair because diamonds are not easy to find. There a lot more i dislike about it. I only play because its a distraction sometimes. A lot of people has left playing the game and i can see why Because at times,  it can be very boring. But there's a lot of things i think can be improved.",
        "When I started playing this GAME it was fun and I enjoyed. But this GAME is becoming not so fun anymore. I didn't mind spending a little bit of real money on It, but it has started to become a rather expensive game. Why on earth would you change the festival gameplay.  I am finding this game has actually become stressful and expensive rather than fun and relaxing",
        "When u feel like playing a relaxing game that's not so intense this game is perfect. There are waiters doing it for u and all u have to do is install coffee machines and talk to your customers. Personally to some people this game might be boring but I really love it",
        "I think this is a great game in general, good graphics and gameplay. However I always have difficulties trying to purchase the gifts, like it will take very long to process the transaction. Is the developer able to do anything about it? It will be greatly appreciated."

        "Touch screen Pacman never as good as joystick. This app way too many popup vid ads. Graphics not the greatest either. But offers several additional mazes and options than standard Pacman layout. The constant forced ads cause me to close app and play something else.",
        "Came for Sonic, stayed for a good game. I suggest adding new ways to use coins, like for different variations of pacman or the ghosts. The only complaint i have is the loading time is quite slow",
        "This games accuracy is worse than my atari 2600 and is 1000 times worse than my 5200. It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless",
        "Great game but I'm a lefty so I pause a lot on accident. Messes up my game. Still love it though.",
        "It would be nice if there were more challenges that utilize every level. Not just the same challenges and levels that I've already competed 5 times over",
        "I am really surprised. The amount of new mazes I've never seen before just blows me away. Of course you can just play the classic version thats why I downloaded it but wow love this game. And you don't have to spend money unless you want to its very kick back. Adds of course but whats a dollar to you?"

Me and my friends loved this game but it seems that you have given up on it.  I assure you that these can beat other MOBA games if you will make it BETTER.   I hope you will make better.  Anyway thanks for the great game but for now, I will uninstall it. But, I will STILL and ALWAYS love this game, it's just that I want it to be better.  Looking Forward to it.  Thanks Guys.!",
        "Firstly, the control was bad. It will be better if a virtual control us added into the game . Next, it is difficult to tap an enemy to attack normally in mobile phones. I hope you can do something like the other games do like mobile legend ( by inserting a bigger size button beside the skills button for normal attacking). Then, time taken was too short. I think it is better if the time taken was removed. I hope for improvements to this game. This game can go further if this game look alike dota, mobile legend, arena of valor and other moba games but can be play offline",

It does have a few adds (chunks of 5 seconds, not bad) and the classic 30 second option add to double coins won (which i do, over a certain price lol)  overfall fun and great game to play when bored",

(Including  new age outlaws ajd xpac too)and change the shirts of shawn and triple h into the dx shirts PLZ! I mostly think you'll  add these legends for RAW 25 years characters and rey as the royal rumble character!",
        "One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don't mind paying for it as well..",
        "Best Wrestling mobile game so far.  Looking forward to new superstars in the future like guys from the Hart Dungeon or more NWO and DX guys.  Or just bring back the Attitude Era days. Enjoying the game and looking forward to the Alliance feature, hoping that it will be available in the next few months.  Great Job Reliance team.  The Best is yet to come indeed.  🏆",
        "reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.",
        "Terrible you can beat someone using a 4 star gold. They are a 1 star, you get down 0 health. But can't pin yet your opponent suddenly pull out reversals and use the signature. But they can block yours. Worst game ever... Legitimate",
        "The gameplay and controls are great!!! But it will be better if the themes of each superstar were added. One things that annoys me is that the superstars are rated very oddly....John Cena is rated less than Elias....How can it be so???!!! If the rating system of the game is fixed then definitely a 5 star for this game."

I say this because when I reach a certain level, there aren't any more food choices. At least, I haven't seen any, or, maybe I am not going far enough to get more food choices. With that being said,  please, please keep coming up with more levels, more food choices and more challenges. This is the longest summary that I have ever written about a game, that's how much I enjoy playing this game. I am asking anyone who is reading this summary to please give \"Burger Shop\" a try. If I had to guess, my guess would be, that, you won't be sorry you did. \"Happy Holidays\" and please have \"A Safe and Happy New Year\" to you all.",
        "Super addicting and fun! This is my 3rd time playing and beating the game. It lets you play through the whole game free but with occasional inescapable video ads. I rarely make app purchases (or even write reviews) but this game is so addicting, $1.99 is so worth being able to play this game filled with hours of fun, with no ad interruptions. It gets more and more challenging but not unbeatable. It's great, I love it!!",
        "I'm 47. I suffered a dramatic brain injury 10yrs ago. My hand eye coordination is almost nonexistent. So I have to play games that the process is easy. I down loaded this game on a whim. I LOVE IT! No gems or money to buy. It's easy and fun. Please try this game. It's great to pass the time and I love the fact you don't have to cook anything. Thanks for this game, will look for more games from you! Player for life!!!!!",
        "I am addicted to it but I don't know what happened to Burger Shop 2. It gets better and is just as addictive! Those little customers crack me up when you take too long to give them their food or something in their order.",
        "Absolutely loved this. It's the best for me. I have played too many cooking games. This one is challenging, nice story, graphics are okay and you never get bored. I have completed all the four modes with five stars in all 100 levels and guess what?  For that I had to play the alien levels again and again. But I never got bored.",
        "Hardly find bad review because this game is very addicted! For you who complain about the long ads, I always play it without any internet connection (to safe the battery power lol) and it is ad free! It is so fun, please make the 2.0 version! Lol"

If you are a friend to enter the game, you can enter the name of the room given to you by clicking on the enter button according to the room name in the first entry into the game and connect directly to your game. (Do not make simple words for your room name, it can be accessed by different users.)<br><br>Counter Terrorist: If you want other favorite maps to be added to our Strike War game immediately, you can support it by giving 5 stars immediately. Good games!",

        "You say is is 35 mb but it is over 120. When I use the manual tilt controls the car would just automatically steer right without me tilting the phone. $99 to unlock everything! I can buy call of duty black ops 3 and its  map packs for less that $99! Also I bought the S Class car bundle  and it never gave me the cars. I still have to buy them! And the VIP benefits don't work. You should make a \"No Ads\" purchase. Like no ads plus everything for $99 you wish!",
        "Everything is okay but ...I think that the cost of nitro starter should be reduced to 3000 credits. And the cost of racer kit box should be reduced to 5000 credits. Graphics r awesome. Moreover I should get more tokens from achievements and more credits from online play. Everything else is awesome, best racing game i ever played. I didn't liked Asphalt 8 but I liked this. I have a request. I have played multiplayer races and sometimes won tuning kits, nitro starter,absolute armor etc . Armor is ok but I do not need tuning kits or nitro starters ,I need tokens and credits and kit boxes. Please add an update where we can win more and more tokens and kit boxes. I do not like the fact that I got 200 tokens by claiming my daily reward, I want to win them.",
        "Awesome as always... Im not gouing talk anythig about this game. 1 thig u should knw is that from me anythig thy create is acceptable. As im RPG and FPS lover   im requeting a game throuhgh this. Its called SAO. A lot player out thre would though the same way. Mywish is to play this game in android smart phone play.",
        "Well the game is so good for its size. Usually for this size, developers will often use the Unity engine which looks sooo bad. I'm glad Gameloft used their own engine which are far superior than others. However, this game is missing something from the previous game, Asphalt 8 which is lack of controller support. It would be more fun if the controller support is added. Cheers!",
        "I've liked every Asphalt game I've played but i can't play this one because the calibration really sucks. I can't tilt to steer because it always gets locked. I DO NOT want to use the other options to control a vehicle because there should be no problem using the default. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!",
        "Not shabby. Fun and great quality in consideration of modest size of download. Having some trouble progressing without being a pocket player, but thats also incentive to hone skill. Hope developers do not neglect to update this game, just because it is the lighter of their asphalt franchise."

        "Its a good game, i like this kind of games and i love when i play with friends too! The game its really easy to play, a strategy game and simply as destroy the enemy base... Love it! Its true that not all are going to like this but for me this game its 5 stars. Btw i have started the game and i said i love to play with friends, does this game has a Couple/Duo match to play with them (Not versus them). Thanks in advice, keep staying great!!",
        "The game is okay it has a lot of faults. The matching system is horrible it always puts me against people that are hundreds of levels higher than me. And somehow their money regenerate quicker and they're able to send  out more and bigger and better units out on the battlefield. Even when the matchmaking system puts me against somebody my own level their money regenerates quicker than mine and they send out a lot more units faster than I can for whatever reason. Uninstalling this game",
        "I absolutely love this game! As a person who enjoys strategy games, from RTS such as Stronghold, Supreme Commander, and C&C, this game takes my top 3 for the phone. The match making system is very good at keeping same skilled players together, as well as it isn't very much a pay to win game. The units are decently balanced and the game isn't to slow or fast. Definitely a game I will keep playing for a long time. I do want to ask, if you guys will be putting in a \"survival mode\", and withstand against waves of enemies. Great job FourThirtyThree",
        "I'll update whenever I can actually play the game. It's up to date. I get to the screen that asks if I'd like to use my Google account or Facebook account. I do not have a Facebook. Obviously I have a Google account. I'm writing this review. I click Google and both options disappear. It sets at that screen where the two options were previously available and nothing happens. I made sure to wait around 5 mins to see if it was a loading issue.. dunno. I'd love to try out the game.",
        "really good game i love it but just some ideas that might make it even better (I think the menu on the left side could have a higher contrast (text and background)or I think the trophy chest amount could be adjusted to the player amount in the clan +to participate in trophy chest you have to be in the clan since it started (midnight)please do some balance changes soon... some untis don't feel to be used enough or some just are OP like the steel saw mech or another idea :to have some way to delete (locked) chests )please reply if you (4:33)see it and want to give a statement",
        "This game is awesome, it reminds me of Guns Up! . The ONLY thing I don't like about it is it's basically pay to win. I only have 5 slots to open chests and it cost gems to open the chest and money to get gems. Other than that, the gameplay is solid. It's very unique in it's actually a wonderfully crafted game and not some thrown together garbage. I probably will end up throwing money at it only because it's made so we'll. But like I said I do feel the process for opening chests is a bit too cash hungry..."

The cards in each suit rank: Ace 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King. An Ace is worth 1 point, Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 10 points each, and all other cards count their face value.ObjectiveThe object of the game is, by drawing and discarding, to form sets and runs, and to to minimize the count of unmatched cards remaining in your hand.A run consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit, such as ♥4, ♥5, ♥6 or ♠8, ♠9, ♠10, ♠J. (A-K-Q of a suit is not a run since aces are low in this game).A set consists of three or four cards of the same rank, such as ♥7, ♣7, ♦7. A card can belong to only one combination at a time - you cannot use the same card as part of both a set and a run.The DealThe first dealer is chosen randomly. Thereafter the dealer is the winner of the previous hand. The cards are dealt one at a time counterclockwise, starting with the dealer: thirteen cards to the dealer and twelve cards to each of the other players. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form the stock.The PlayEach turn consists of the following:Draw You must begin by taking one card from either the top of the stock or the top card on the discard pile, and adding it to your hand. You may only take a card from the discard pile if you are able to create a meld (a set or run) with it, and you are then obliged to expose the meld.Exposing Melds If you have a valid meld or melds (sets or runs) in your hand you can expose any of them on the table in front of you. Melding is optional if a card was taken from the stock; you are not obliged to expose a meld just because you can, and note that melds held in hand do not count against you at the end of the play. A player must lay at least one meld on the table for the hand to be considered opened. In the special case that you can meld a set of four and you have not drawn from the discard pile to complete the meld, you can lay the set of four down face down. By doing this you can \"open\" your hand without losing the bonus payments for a secret set of 4 and without revealing the cards to the other players.Laying off (sapaw) This is also optional. If you wish, you may add cards to sets or runs previously melded by yourself or others. There is no limit to the number of cards a player may lay off in one turn.

The cards in each suit rank: Ace 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King. An Ace is worth 1 point, Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 10 points each, and all other cards count their face value.<br><br><b>Objective</b><br>The object of the game is, by drawing and discarding, to form sets and runs, and to to minimize the count of unmatched cards remaining in your hand.<br><br>A run consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit, such as &#x2665;4, &#x2665;5, &#x2665;6 or &#x2660;8, &#x2660;9, &#x2660;10, &#x2660;J. (A-K-Q of a suit is not a run since aces are low in this game).<br><br>A set consists of three or four cards of the same rank, such as &#x2665;7, &#x2663;7, &#x2666;7. A card can belong to only one combination at a time - you cannot use the same card as part of both a set and a run.<br><br><b>The Deal</b><br>The first dealer is chosen randomly. Thereafter the dealer is the winner of the previous hand. The cards are dealt one at a time counterclockwise, starting with the dealer: thirteen cards to the dealer and twelve cards to each of the other players. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form the stock.<br><br><b>The Play</b><br>Each turn consists of the following:<br><br><b>Draw</b> You must begin by taking one card from either the top of the stock or the top card on the discard pile, and adding it to your hand. You may only take a card from the discard pile if you are able to create a meld (a set or run) with it, and you are then obliged to expose the meld.<br><b>Exposing Melds</b> If you have a valid meld or melds (sets or runs) in your hand you can expose any of them on the table in front of you. Melding is optional if a card was taken from the stock; you are not obliged to expose a meld just because you can, and note that melds held in hand do not count against you at the end of the play. A player must lay at least one meld on the table for the hand to be considered opened. In the special case that you can meld a set of four and you have not drawn from the discard pile to complete the meld, you can lay the set of four down face down. By doing this you can &quot;open&quot; your hand without losing the bonus payments for a secret set of 4 and without revealing the cards to the other players.<br><b>Laying off</b> (sapaw) This is also optional. If you wish, you may add cards to sets or runs previously melded by yourself or others. There is no limit to the number of cards a player may lay off in one turn. A player need not have opened their hand to lay off. Laying a card off on another player&apos;s exposed meld prevents that player from calling Draw on his or her next turn.<br><b>Discard</b> At the end of your turn, one card must be discarded from your hand and placed on top of the discard pile face up.",

        "Great! You should definitely download this! I really love this game. The game is very simple yet fun. I have only been playing twist for a little but I'm already hooked. The only reason I rated this 4 stars Is because of the ads. There Is an ad about every four times you fail. These ads are very common in most Ketchapp games and they aren't that much of a bother.",
        "Good time killer Once you get the hang of it, it's simple in theory, but still challenging. It's a really basic game with only limited things you can change, so once you've bought everything, you kind of just build up points, but it's good as a time killer. Ads are only once every few failures. Not the end of the world. And not laggy or too bright on my screen.",
        "Fun And Perhaps Too Simple This is a very simple game. As in, one or two sound effects, no music at all, seven varying colors of blocks, and a blank background except for a spiral of never ending blocks. All of the fun is from the focus you give in one simple tap from not dying. I feel like there is some sort of depth perception problem, but that might just be me. The achievements and the different skins are minimalistic to say the least. However, for an arcade game, I give it a pass if you are into fast reaction types of games.",
        "Pretty Decent Time Killer A pretty decent app with a few minor downsides. These mainly consist of adds that pop up when you're not expecting them, meaning you can accidentally click on them quite a bit. Other than that seems well optimised and it's very easy to loose hours to this game.",
        "Nice Game but I have a few suggestions. I have bought all of the balls and floor colors and i'd like some more to buy especially because it's easy to get. Also if the little pink balls point/money thing could also have some design options than that would be great. I've read some reviews that says this game has too many ads but I personally haven't had any problem with ads. The amount of ads in this game is also found in other games so it's really nothing to complain about.",
        "Still recommend something else With LOOOTTTSSS of patience and time,  you could get good. Problem is,  the levels would be that same over and over. I recommend something like geometry dash. It has lots of levels, full version has level  maker, also you can play other levels made by people, it's colorful and VERY ADDICTING, and last, it's more popular to ensure that there is always a level you can play, with people making them in level editor."

I Downloaded it. Thought I would test it. Disconnected from my wifi and forgot the name. Then ran the app. Got a password that I knew wasn't mine. Thought to myself \" maybe it tricks or Forced it to take the password. Tried it like 2 times and it failed. I was like \"WTH, this must be some sort of fake/malware/addware that some how got into the app store. Went back to the app store to uninstall it And thought to myself I should read the description just in case I did something wrong or had to set it up in some way. .. I did.  I apologise.

        "The original sonic dash is better imo. had a better atmosphere, maps looks better gameplay also better. the original was a masterpiece. also, I don't like that they introduce scenes that requires you to tilt your phone. since i played sonic dash i didn't expect it to be there. it's annoying when you're laying down and play the game and you got that scene just ruins the gameplay.",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.",
        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I'm going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable."

What i also like about it is that it's a free game that doesn't try to force you to pay to continue on. It's not too hard but just challenging enough so that you don't lose interest. The one problem i have with the game is that it's requires lots of coins and diamonds to open other stores. A heads up to others playing this game..do not use all of your coins and diamonds on upgrades because you can do a lot of the upgrades later.",

        "Love everything about the game. I had some problems getting the super grill...part of it was internet connectivity,  part was? I sent 2 emails and did not get a response. Paid for it on the 25th of feb got a congrats on the 4th of march. Otherwise love this game!",

        "Great game, but gets to the point of wanting or needing to spend real money to complete some levels, as it seems some cant be acheived without a bonus which needs to be brought! Saying that though, this game has provided hours of fun."

        "As a critic, I've encountered my share of arcade shooters, and the cartoonyness of this shooter is a selling point that adds to its endearingness. The freemium aspect is less intimidating than a lot of games on the Play Store, and the fast-paced touch-screen gameplay compels the gamer to win the weapons rather than buy them. This is quite possibly among the best shooters I've encountered. I've seen online ones that aren't this good.  Now if the developers would only adapt HRMageddon to the Play Store...",
        "Make it easier to get the best guns. Lower the prices on the best guns. Give people who now start the game to get the best guns for a limited time. After every chapter someone completed make one of the best guns be free but if they complete other chapters they can't get anything free again. Please do this or people will delete this app since they can't get good guns and they will need to buy guns for different chapters since some guns will be to weak. Please do this,it will be better.",
        "This game is a blast great fun love the levels love the enemy characters  great weapons too not hard to get and if you die you can continue by watching a video. This game is the bomb. Love it. Still playing even though I've played all the levels over and over but I just can't stop .This game's explosive.",
        "Everything is fine only 2 things need to be done  1.Connect the game to google play , there is no option of saving progress to google play 2. I am waiting for part 2 or more missions in classic , Mr.Prsident went space why we are still here ,.please update the app and bring some new missions or Bring Major Mayhem 2.",
        "Do NOT be put off by the in-app purchases.  Major Mayhem isn't like most IAP games that give you a small tease and then force you to pony up big bucks to go anywhere significant.  I've had tons of fun with this game without spending a penny, unlocking all the essential content.  Gameplay is amazingly smooth on my Bionic, controls are intuitive.  This is the way mobile gaming should be done.  I'm going to buy some in-game coins because I believe in supporting developers of great games.",
        "Personally my favorite game right now. I have played the game for 2 days and I already have the minigun and have beaten all the Tropics missions and I am halfway through the metropolis missions. I love this game, only suggestion is to add more weapons. Or a new game mode, or maybe a new chapter for the classic gamemode"

There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",
        "Finally! For the the longest time I've been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn't look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.",
        "Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it's so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",
        "This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don't play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don't make us wait foreverrrr!",
        "It's a fun game and I'm enjoying it. However, I've come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.",
        "This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would've given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the \"!!\" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game"

        "Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it's class.",
        "By a stroke of luck I got my old game back in February 2018 after a span of a year and a month. Good to be back. A suggestion : why don't you have something like a banking system wherein you can exchange the different currencies in play in the game. There could be a selling price and a purchase price which gives the bank a margin",
        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "They could tweak a few things such as being able to pack items as you reach necessary amount when increasing storage capacity. Considering I'm at the point I need 19 of each item (and yet it still only increases by 5) it takes up way too much space. Certain items take way too much time to produce and practically impossible to find in the trade depot. Aside from those and a few other things, I really enjoy this game.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I've made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new \"club wars\" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There's always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don't have to spend real money to play the game, but I'll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I've even started a second city on another device with my other email."

        "This game is really fun, challenging at times & exercises and has a great variety of important brain exercises. My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it's the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!😀",
        "Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn't deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it's to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.",
        "Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!",
        "It's fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I've failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.",
        "I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on \"memory match\" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it's worth installing.",
        "There's a glitch in \"Quick Decision Skill\" game. It is based on whether the previous and current object is same or not. When I click on the peach-moon-type object as same, it gives error, though I click on Same when two moons appear consecutively in the game. This way I'll not be able to clear the levels."

Please unlock it's 3rd realm as I could play only 30 stages, I want to play it more. Love it. I'm editing my comment as now 3rd realm has been opened. Difficulty of red realm is quite good. And then the boss fight. I loved it. Worth playing it. Please upload ninja arashi 2 very soon. Can't wait to play it.",
        "Im really picky about what i download on my phone. But this is by far one of the best games I've tried. The controls are simple and reminds me of old Nintendo style games. Mario is the first that comes to mind. The music and the stuff he says is a very nice touch. Dude is hilarious sometimes. Graphics are out of this world with a little spray of blood here and there. Very tasteful. Easy to get and save coins and diamond things. Overall i wish i could make everyone download. Ive been telling everyone.",
        "This the first time i write a review for a game because of all the mobile games I've played this was one of the best if not THE best game I've played... nice short story, great gameplay, pretty challengin, great graphics and more. And most importantly it wasn't a \"pay to win\" game all thay was required was skills. 10/10 Can't wait for Ninja Arashi 2. Good job Developers.",
        "Very addictive and nice game, its one of my companions in leisure... I've been playing it for a very long time. I would have rated it 5 stars if there were more weapons to buy in the game and if I could place the control buttons according to my choice.. hope to see these updates in future..

        "I love this game. It's the closest thing to tap tap revenge I've ever found. A few notes though:  There is so much lag that it seriously impedes gameplay I really like having a customizable Avatar like ttr3 I don't really like how the notes jump into the button and stay there, I like when it's smoother.  Other than that I would say this is a great game!",
        "I love tap games and this one is almost perfect. When tapping to replay a song I'd be nice to be able to adjust the difficulty again making it easier. Slightly disappointed you cannot play without WiFi,  but other than that a great game I recommend!",
        "The only issue I have with this game is as a mobile game it is flawed. Naturally since it is vertical I hold it with two hands and play with two thumbs, making the triples (one note on every part) very hard to get all perfects on. Other that truly a fun game.",
        "Have always loved this game but even on my brand new Note 8 it has a hard time registering notes that are side by side at the same time. Even if I intentionally press harder and space my fingers better. It's random but will happen consitantly through a song if that makes sense.",
        "I have loved the tap tap series way before revolution came out. I started playing this and have already noticed a problem regarding gameplay. As you play, there is the unlucky event of all the hit buttons missing, and reappearing again just for you to lose your combo, and generally lose the game. Just a little problem I have.",
        "Game itself is definitely a good throwback to the Tap Tap days, however I'm disappointed with how Everlong (Foo Fighters, 100 rubies) cuts off at 2:02, rather than playing the entire song. Progression of rubies is kinda slow, which becomes bothersome if you don't enjoy pop music."

        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "Well... I rated to soon. The gacha rate for weapons have been reduced to a point that its the same from other games with gacha system. So if you suck at games with gacha system, you'll ended up using 3* weapons and armors. SAVE all your crystals for a 10+1 pull which cost 5k.",
        "Amazing! I love this game. I loved the first Dissidia, and this is like part 2, but a mobile game. I usually don't like turn based games, but this is one of the few I can say is definitely a 5 star game. Great graphics, great controls, UI, story, characters, and I like how it's like a sequel to Dissidia woth a twist. Addictive and fun to play for sure. And by the way, the music is fantastic. As much as o wish I could hear some of the old tunes in their original forms, the remixing and putting together of the OG Dissidia soundtrack woth some new twists was a really great touch.",

Unnecessary ads withing the game play , Ad videos for coins or gold are understanding  but every time I end a stage a ad pops up. BIG NO",

In this cooking dash you can upgrade your cooking materials and move to newer places. You can add more helpers as you play and level up. For my opinion I say this game is a great choice, on the other hand getting money can be hard. Especially when you keep your customers waiting. When they wait to long you lose more money, you may not care but you will have a target and if you don't reach it you can't move up a level. The game is free to download. This is a quick active cooking game, I highly recommend you to download this game.",

        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "Love it,love it Love it! I love the free updates and the designs are divine! The levels are really hard well some of them! I hope you make more dancing line versions and games! A prequel,sequel or a dancing line 2,3,4,or 5 is something you guys should make! I love this game! This girl I used to like got me hooked on this game! Make more Dancing Line games! This is Geometry Dash with a line! Lol😂😀",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.",
        "Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!"

        "(REAL REVIEW! NOT A PAID REVIEWER) Really enjoying the game. It's a good time killer. Some levels are a lot of fun and actually require a little bit of skill. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is there are way too many ads. It will randomly make you watch a video to upgrade your ride or character, and/or to play a level. There's been a few times where I had enough tickets to play, and coins to upgrade my character the two points recommended, and I had to watch a video for all three. Three ads before you can even play a level is ridiculous. I understand that it's a big part of making money for the developers, but I've never had a free game with this many ads. Get rid of some of the ads and I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars.",

        "Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can't find Bradinsky song. It's okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol",
        "Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can't play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.",
        "I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",
        "Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on 'player choice' lately."

When you updated the game I lost my boxer twice WHY? is it that? Can you explain to me WHY when you knock down opponent 3 times & I still lost WHY?  How can opponent get a RAGE PUNCH without even having one? Alots of times game won\"t allow you to knock down or out your opponent why? Can you explain to me when knock down opponent in first round. The game count to 8 then you knock the opponent down again in same round  the count is less like 3 why is that?",

If you wanna heal the energy turn on your mobile data while playing the energy will slowly heal until full, and you can get free chest, also free alchemist and this less data usage. When first time is so difficult to finish the stage with the junkweapon, until im get a rare weapon in some stage, it will be easy😀 excellent job hummingbird mobile game👍👍👍keep going..",
        "It's a good game. Up on the - it's nice looking and has a great idea scale. I haven't encountered any bugs and I wish there was more of a multiplayer element. Where you can change your name, join a chat room, and had coop. I would play in coop along with a main menu chat room and a in game chat. If multiplayer were to be added I'd like a survival or hoard mode in it but for the game we have it's fun. Decent sized and replayable up until you hit Max and can't find stuff to do. If there are newer games like this I will play.",
        "The hard work of the devs show in every parts of the game, not like big devs out there who throws 3 or 4 maps and make players replay those  tons of times... Really every level is unique and  enjoyable.  Only con is the loots... boss enemies shud drop valuable items.  Thanks for making a good game.",
        "Well, it's good as it is. But why is it that riot police cannot wield the chainsaw/sword that he is carrying?? That should be his special skill right?? Like dawn captain having a bazooka with her, then fire it as her special skill. My question is what is the purpose of riot police carrying a sword/chainsaw, if he cannot wield it?? You ruined him you know?? :/. But the game is good, but nor really :/",
        "Graphics are awesome gameplay great so far and it can be played  offline.  Controls  need a little work particularly to make  it easier to navigate but besides that its a really good game almost addictive...  Oh n add damn setting to adjust sound and or turn it off",
        "This game is awsome.. I've only played for a couple of days but I know that I won't uninstall this game.. I hope we can edit the name though (or maybe I just don't know how yet😂) also I wish we make more characters and then we make it PvP mode.. but still it's a cool game! keep it up guys! 👍👍👍"

Then it got to the point at level 2 where the crib section was and the ads stop loading try again later. I keep trying to go back after waiting to play and it still gives me the same response. $10 to pay for a game is extremely expensive, I have never seen a game on google play for that amount of money. Most are free or free trial but not at the rate you guys charge. Seriously? you guys need to be more reasonable because the majority of your players are kids. So a word to the developer. If you want to attract and keep your content enjoyable for all ages, make it affordable to all young and old. Im just saying. I myself enjoyed the game overall, but I honestly will not pay that amount to play the game when there are so many other games to play that are free for all.",

The swipe motion didn't seem to work very well on a lot of levels making me replay the same level multiple times because swipe wouldn't work and would mess up the whole level. I almost deleted it because of this but I'm glad I stuck with it.",

        "Just another game that is just made for ads. Even if you try to pause it an ad will pop up. And really is annoying playing games that are this easy and the only reason you die is because it also cheats and kills you off if you haven't dies so it can throw another advertisement on the screen. I'm deleting it, and recommend that you don't even waste your time on downloading it. Probably one of the worst games (as far as being over run by ads) i have ever played! Hands down the worst.",

Even had ads saying would you like to remove the ads. After I opened the game. Had 2 ads before I even played the first level. Because of so many ads an very not so good controls. I'll will be deleted right after I finish this review. Improve the controls an remove the ads by at least half an I'll install an play again. And if it improves a lot. I'll even see about spending money IRL to play an upgrade stuff in the game. Tanks for your time.",
        "So many fuckn ads I wanted to throw my phone. Gun doesn't spin around fast enough and it takes 20 shots to kill 1 guy. Sorry ass game",
        "Can barely get started with all the adds impossible to play the game without spending real money. 3 adds between each level is a joke",
        "Ads every 2 or 3 minutes and needs better control implementation. Swivel/aim really should be on the left with switch weapons above the fire. Or vise versa.",
        "Excellent game if you just want to spend half an hour blowing things up a really good paced game it's worth the £1.70 to get rid of the adds but you don't have to . After each battle you get a lucky dip to win money for more weapons or missiles",
        "Way too many ads. Better to make the app paid rather than asking for payment to remove ads."

        "It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don't even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging."

        "I LOVE this game ... like I am so hooked.... I spend way too much money though because I love all the dragons so much just so adorable I always buy the dragon bundles.   It does suck whenever you get so high up with feeding your dragons then it costs a lot of food to feed them like if I didn't buy so many dragon bundles I would have a hard time feeding them to higher levels... Even now it's hard.  Anyways I am addicted to this game though other than that!  ♡♡",
        "Shame I couldn't transfer my data from Windows 10 Mobile to Android. Would've been nice to continue my game instead of having to start afresh, but it's still a good game, and probably a better experience on Android.  It would be nice to be able to trade dragon eggs and other objects from my inventory with friends.",
        "Love this game! It's addictive! Great graphics! Could use an better \" how to section\".  Biggest downfalls are the some of the hatch times and breed times are very discouraging. I know they want to make money on the game and I do purchase in game items, but the amount if gems it would cost for these breed & hatches are a bit much. Not ready to give up though cause the game is great so I'll keep waiting it out for now. I would recommend the game for sure.",
        "This game is very addictive, fun, and a great game over all. Eventually if you play it long enough there isn't much you can do on the app until you wait but other then that it's a decent time killer. I haven't ran into any issues with the game and I recomended installing it",
        "Honestly a great game. It has ads but those are optional. You only view ads if you want some extra stuff. You click on a button to view the ads and after, depending on what you picked you wanted, you get. So please don't think that the ads just randomly pop-up out of nowhere. They only appear if you choose for them to be there. I'd say download the game, you won't regret it 👍",
        "I didn't know how insanely addictive this game is when I downloaded it. The graphics of the dragons are beautiful, but the background could use some work in that department. The gameplay is smooth and not impossible when you don't make purchases! Yet I did because this game is brilliant!!! I recommend it to anyone who is bored of just building and buying over and over. The different challenges and events are so well thought-out! I cannot get over this fantastic game!!!!!"

        "It is amazing.really keeps you hooked on.. However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.",
        "Such a great and fun game but you can't do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.",
        "I thought it would be more about solving things, but there are no brain challenges for now and I'm on the 10th level. I've noticed that a few times some of my coins disappeared. Slow as you need to grow a lot of food etc. before you can do anything. You would have to spend quite a lot of real money to make it reasonable pace",
        "The pop-up ads trying to get you to spend money on the game that happen every time you open the game are annoying.  Also annoying that there are so many new missions that you can never finish one before a new one starts and if you do the missions you never have time to work on your own island.  This game is nothing like the pictures suggest for this app.  I thought there would be adventure and puzzles.  It's a glorified Farmville without the interaction of other neighboring farms (or islands in this case).  Still, it's addicting and frustrating that I can never clear those little missions that line up on the side of the screen.  There isn't enough time in life to finish them.",
        "I like the game, it helps pass time. My only complaint is you make it super hard to do anything without having tonso3ns real money. Which is ridiculous. I get that you need to make money off of this, but don't be so ridiculous about it.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Not spent a penny on it yet and managing alright to do tasks etc in a reasonable time. Though I've not completed a quest yet but that could be me not getting back to the game regularly enough. That's my issue though."

And at the end the building catches fire and you have to get and out and bury krasue's head .Best horror game ever.",

        "Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.",
        "Good game however, once you've taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world's and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.",
        "Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.",
        "It's a really great game! I'm really looking forward to an update. I think it'd be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I'm looking forward to see what you guys do!",
        "This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.",
        "please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there's not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you."

I have encountered one level during which a Sexually explicit advertisement was played, replete with links. I don't know how many levels it has that does this but I am sure I'll discover many.  Parents Beware.",
        "This app is fun but it apps dont pop up the game just brings you staight to the google play store to download which i am pretty sure is illegal. Also i dont remember a licensing agreement agreeing to this. I have also seen other reviews claiming that there are sexual explict ads and if this is true then this app is commitimg a crime by showing sexual content on an app that is rated 10+. Is there is sexual content the app must be rated 18 and up.",
        "I literally wrote a review, I hit submit and guess what...My review disappeared. I liked this game at first, but I cant get past a certain level. I was going to use the cheats and it said I needed one, but I could download another game and get 2 free cheats. I did that and played the other game for nearly 3 hours on and off. No free cheats. The other game is better anyways.",

        "The gameplay itself was good. But after I got to the insance stages in both mode, it kept crashing. Later I found that it can only be opened offline but it wouldn't let me connect to fb. Everytime I try, it would just crash again. It would have been a great game if it wasn't for this issue.",
        "Great Game/Brain Teaser.. The best way to challenge your brain and have fun doing it (with silliness!) I always come back to this game, every so often after I've mastered it, to test and rebuild my skills again."

        "Addictive. I love this game. Not only is is fairly easy to play, fun, but it's a good time waster. I play it a lot on my lunch breaks and stuff. Lotta fun! If only the claw machines were as easy to win in real life, huh??? Lol great job. U'd get 5+ stars if u updated it a lil bit. Like maybe new prizes or around the holidays u can win special unique prizes. Example : Halloween is coming up, maybe u can win pumpkins, skeletons, etc, etc. Just a thought! Other than my suggestion it's a REALLY AWESOME game! Nice update!!",
        "Game itself is fun but.... Waaaay too many ads for other games. Had three stars but dropped it to one for reason I just mentioned. Plus 15 minutes offline equals one grab.....way too long. Considering you max out at a certain amount it would make more sense and encourage people to play more often if it was changed to every 5 minutes.",
        "Not received my extra grabs 3 times I have owned this game on a few different devices and I am impressed with the improved game play from when I first played, but now I have watched 3trailers and also got 102 on the cross road tapjoy game and not received any of my free grabs, I am seriously not impressed, also why does the counter stop regeneration when your in the store or in a menu, this should not effect if the game is open,I hope the small bugs are fixed soon. I am not willing to keep playing until I get my grabs",
        "Please tell me why you have the option to do things to get free grabs, but when you do them it doesn't give you anything. I like the game but there really should be an easier way to get grabs. (Edit) Lowered my rating because the last two times I have gone to play my claws have disappeared. It said I had 20 then when I went to play I had none. -.-",
        "Great game but... Since installing the game I paid to remove ads, I still get ads and a new ad is now causing the game to crash. I am not happy and considering ditching the game from my device. It was a total waste of money paying to remove the ads, I feel like I have been conned out of my money.",
        "Once I got the hang of it it's a blast! It is fun and addicting! The only thing that I would ask is that for the free grabs, when I watched the trailers for extra grand I didn't get them. That's a bummer, hope that can get fixed. Other then that Super Fun app! Can't wait to play Claw 2. :)"

Music is great lol try not to make it to hard lol  R u going to make more Season games. I replay them . Ones I missed go back to get a better score. Oh I forgot trying to the birds out of the cages is a little hard lol ya does this person want easy game lol lol. I am going to brag I am the Dimond #3 league  .Also on top of the friends game.  Oh another thing I am proud to say I am 80years old in July 81 lol  that's life in the fast lane lol Just lv the games that I play.",

        "It's ok but the game sticks. I have plenty of space memory etc. Then it doesn't always give me my points. It has too many adds. Then you could give the shock birds as part of the power ups. Then I get blank screen at times. Takes too long.",
        "The levels are getting harder and sometimes impossible to get past. It gets tedious and I lose interest. I think I loved it at first. Now I wonder if I wasted my time.",

I hope your team will be fix this problems soon. ( Good Luck ) 😉🤘.",
        "I dont know but for some reasons the targeting is kinda bad. I was able to play other MOBA's like ML, LxS and AOV and I never had any problem with the controls. Gonna stop playing this now. I regret wasting money to get that VIP label.. Not gonna recommend to my friends.",
        "I gave 2 stars on Controls coz I feel like its not that good enough! I suggest to make the skill buttons a lil' big or more responsive. The skills cancel button appear very close that when I use manually on Ultimate its kinda disturb. For example like in heroes Lapina Ultimate & some other heroes too! So kindly look onto the skill buttons, make it more comport like that in Mobile Legends Bang Bang. Sorry for mentioning other moba games mlbb here but I had to.. To make my complain more clear. Hope U Devs will understand. Thank you",

You did a great job on the effects, and even when i had the ghost playing the brightest song it sounded creepy. The dragon also made me want to hide as it sounded like it was stomping around as the music blasted through my ears.  Overall, great app. I might be using it on halloween... XD",
        "The app works wonders! The cathedral effect is my favorite (it also makes your voice sound a thousand times better, lol). There are some effects I'm not a big fan of, though, and I think they're not that interesting, such as Poltergeist, Android, Cyborg or Devil. Still, this is the best app for voice effects!",
        "This is the best app! You don't need to talk or to record your own voice in order for this app to change your voice. All you have to do is to type what you want to say and.... That's all! You git my 5 Star, greetings from Philippines",
        "This app is surprisingly a pretty efficient and versatile little gizmo! It has actually quality effects and is super easy to use. I find myself downloading it again and again whenever I need sound stuff, because I keep getting roped into bigger fancier apps that get too complicated and expensive.",
        "Fantastic! Though this app has ads, it doesn't let them takeover the fun of using the app. The ads just sit there minding their own business! All in all, it's Awesomeness Unleashed!",
        "I like how you change your voice and record anything like barks, nerf guns, singing and growls. It might be cool if you added a GROWN-UP voice effect you know for kids, plus people who are already grown up could see what they'd sound like double grown-up! PS: Your video \"IS very funny\" No, it wasn't funny, IT WAS HILARIOUS! :D"

        "I love this game, but I am very unhappy about the Africa challenge, I finished all of the parts of the hospital and the game told me I needed 40 more of the blue hearts, but there were no more tasks that needed to be done.  Because of this I did not receive the final prize which I find very irritating!",
        "First off.. I like the game BUT the epinephrine shot is so dysfunctional or I am not getting it. tutorials for the emergency things might help but I always get an x after pushing the syringe in. Second, we should be able to purchase gold stars with our cash winnings. Not everyone likes to spend real money on games and you cant get enough free or earned hearts to be productive enough. Lastly, if we purchase staff, that is what we should get, not duplicates that morph to skill, empathy or dedication cards. Thats just plain bait and switch. Lastly, on my android tablet, since the last update, there is a bug when scrollong through the staff or items in the store where the sceen bounces back to the beginning unless you use two fingers to keep it still. Pain in the butt. other than that it is an interesting game.",
        "The upgrade cost should be reduced or collection could be increased so difficult to manage upgrading, With low income",
        "Great game. Addicted already and literally just started playing 20 mind ago.",
        "I cant even get onto the game. It wont load. All my other games are fine",
        "Like the game, but ever since the update I will watch the ads but I won't receive any of the gifts including hearts! Please fix!"

        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?",
        "I love the concept and the artwork. However, I'm quickly losing interest because of how slowly the story progresses. I wait 24 hours to get 300 energy, play the mini game, and watch the ads. This means I get 450 energy each day. Today for all of that, I got maybe 100 words, all about twisted dolls and dresses.. As for the main character there has been one hint of action from him but mostly stoney silence and short one liners and I've been playing for a week now. Please consider either changing the way energy works or advancing the plot at a quicker pace. Personally, if it does pick up in another week, I will probably stop playing this one.",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ❤"

Too bad it seems like there's no updates I would love to play people live online and Stickman smash the whole world lol if you don't have the patience to take the time to practice and get good at this game then this game ain't for you move along. I'm awesome at this game like Donnie yen in IP man  1 2 and 3",
        "It's a fun game... But not when you realise how much bots are favoured when attacking or being attacked. I tested it out, I could NEVER do damage at all when I was stuck in a corner, or if the bot was. It pisses me off so much. Especially when the bots can punch you but you can never punch them.",

The one thing that is bad is that you need maore levels! But luckily there is a random level where that kinda helps, try to think of more ideas and solutions to this game, PLEASE",

There was a time when my sword was stuck and slid me into a corner and when I got hit in the head, my sword fell through to floor. Other than that, endless fun",

        "I enjoy this game thoroughly however I recently spent ninja coins and happened to get 2 kid madaras in the sakura/ino balze level summon. However neither were sent to my stash of characters... this isn't the first time this has happened. It happened before with itachi during the december event (it did get resolved, but the fact that it happened again worries me :/)",
        "It's fun and all but there's a bug out. I did all three of the limit break summons and I got Itachi twice. Ok no big. But when I went to the character list that says 2 new characters they weren't there. Please fix.",
        "*update - if you want any special characters be ready to spend 100$'s. The summon you use is just a giant cash grab and never gives you the special characters. I wouldn't waste the money. * Update  pvp is a joke they predetermine who is likely to win by where they place the Chakra drains and who they allow to go first when attributes are tied. The game is going down hill.",
        "This game is great. One of the few Naruto games that i actually enjoy playing and continue playing on my phone.  Though if i had to complain, it would be the fact that the game starts you off with very little jems to summon characters and its somewhat hard to obtain them.",
        "Game would crash every time it entered the first mission with Kakashi. Not impressed. I was really excited to play this but not even the tutorial works!",
        "I really want to give an amazing rating. But once you go out of the app, you're forever banished to the loading screen. I've downloaded all the data and okayed the first five missions. I close the app and open it back up after a while. And I can never get out of the initial loading screen. It's very sad and disappointing to not be able to play this great game. Unfortunately, I have to uninstall because it's a literal waste of space in my phone now."

I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I'm not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won't make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.",

        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver.",

Normaly, a mobile game is made by 3 people, and even then... look at the quality of some of the apps that you skip by because your not interested in it... i do a little programing myself (nothing compared to making games though) so i know how hard and stressfull it is. Looking at the apps i play, this would be in my personal top 10 daily games i like to play (with lords moble and clash of clans) so its amazing how well they did! And thats BEFORE you realize it was only 2 people who made this! The story is really cool and im exited to see where they take it for chapters 3 and 4.",
        "The glitch where range attack from Edna and Louisa pass throught the enemy instead of hitting, is still there, also the glitch also cause the character to walk to somewhere not suppose to be walked on, such as on water behind wall, and goes out of the map. I really like your game, but the bugs ruin it, please find a way to fix."

        "The worst thing about this game is loading. It takes years to start, and like TBs to start. A 200 kbps internet speed isn't enough to load this game game. Really tired of. It takea almost 30 mins to start game. Will uninstall if they won't make it better in this regard.",
        "The game is fun; however, since the last update, it always halted.  Whenever a static ads popup (an image ad, not any interactive video ad), the game needs to be restarted.  It happened very very often, almost every 2 lives.  It's been 3+ weeks and no fix.    I don't mind ads.  But if ads make the game non-functional, I guess it should be the top priorities to fix it.  I've reported the bugs several times, no fix, no response.",
        "In the month i have played this game ive lost billions of gold, lots of items and hundreds of thousands of game money because the app freezes and or doesnt pay out after i win a match or warch a ad. Also watching ads it will say i need a stable connection but i have a 1gig fiber conection and i work for a major national telecom company. I like the game other then this! Tried to contact support and all it says is oops something went wrong.",
        "Game is awesome.  Graphics are good,  but be prepared to be bombarded with ads and it takes FOREVER  to load each mission. For every 5min you spent playing,  you will spend another 2 waiting or watching ads",
        "S7 Samsung edge phone keep crashing after the update.  Please fix it.  The game is fun. Unable to get free rubies today. Problem loading ads. Please fix.",
        "Love the game just get tired of losing my abilities when the game has to go into a shut down and it has been doing that for the past week and a half I have lost numerous rubies cockle shells gold and trophies because of this and have written to you numerous times I wish this could be fixed thank you"

Also I'm the new update it asked if I wanted to reload an old profile and I've lost all the galactic and colossal cards I've earned. Any chance I can get my old account back?",
        "A very buggy pay to win game. This game should be called \"Plant VS Zombies - GREED\". Multiplay is rigged, so cards will come out in favour who pays more. So, to publisher is not enough income of adds on game worth of 2$, but have in-game purchace worth of HUNDRED of dollars. Really? On a casual kid's game? Greed to infinity and beyond.",
        "You should have a way to report cheaters quickly and easily. Some have 8 of the same card so you can't beat them. Not sure how someone can enjoy a game by cheating. It means you're actually a loser not a winner. Keep losing connection even though I can still see what's going on in the game then suddenly says I've lost connection. Annoying it almost always happens on a winning streak. What happened to win streak bonus? Won 3 times in a row, no bonus.",
        "Please fix ur connectivity!!! Why i sometimes disconnected from rank matches even though my line is strong? This is annoying when i could win the battle but u guys made me lose by saying my connection has problem😡",

But I just want you to change one thing back please. Please can you make this game so I'm able to play without data and Wi-Fi. Please can you guys do this for me.",

The season restarted, I got my rewards for last season, and started again at level 30. Then the next time I signed in I was back at my previous level of Ultimate, I could tell the game went back to the old game . Is this going to be fixed ..?? I'm still playing last season's level"

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "Amazing game reminds me of the old school games . But the only problem is the lives you give us to play. They are so few and they take a lot of time to refill. PLEASE remove the life or ball things from this game it will be the best if you do that cause I was playing and level by level I was getting exited and I wanted to rate this game 5 stars but suddenly this GAME OVER thing comes and I had to give you this ratings.please let us play without stopping and waiting for the life to come."

        "Hate the new update. What's with you and all these chibi things? You've done it before and based on the review, your players love the Mature and Realistic style much better. So why you changed back again? You have totally Lost your Identity and Uniqueness as LoA game.  If you planned on doing this, why don't you do it in the first place? so we don't have to waste our time and money!",
        "What's with the chibi hero icons? 😭 The artwork was so good and everything works smoothly before the update. Also, during battle, it's lagging. In my  opinion, the previous one is way better than current. I've been a fan of different LoA versions, please don't ruin this one. 😟",
        "I *HATE* the new style. The reason why I liked this game in the first place was because there were no chibi characters. Dominion has no instructions and seems rather useless - but could be developed into something cool. The team formation doesn't have a way to sort your characters (I wish it was ordered by BR). I can get used to the new layout but for right now adjusting is hard. Thanks for developing the game more but please go back to the original character designs.",
        "Update on 2/23 made the game worse. Originally i gave this game a 5 star but with this update it feels more like a 3 star if not 2 star game. I get that you have to update games to keep it fun but sometimes you shouldn't change something just for the sake of change. Why not add content instead of trying to fix something that isn't broken.",
        "I started playing this game few days ago and I liked it so much. The graphics, controls, story all we're very interesting and addictive. Until the developers decided to update this game and completely ruin it and making it just like other mainstream RPG genere with ordinary graphics.   They just completely removed the story of the game and now every stage looks like I'm playing some Angry Bird infact even that game has some story to every level.   In conclusion, this game was more fun before the update but now it's like ordinary RPG.",

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "Awesome graphics, and for what you get on a phone, it really is an amazing game. The only complaint (if you can even call it that) I have is the controls can be a little tricky as sometimes when you're trying to swing left or right you can accidentally change your weapon instead of swing to either side. Aside from that, tremendous gameplay, multiple modes to play, amazing graphics, really just an awesome game. Make sure you have a really good internet connection.",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "One of the dumbest cod ripoff i have seen and played in 2k18 so far. You need 20 bullets to kill someone with head shot. Dont waste your time with this dumb game. Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination.",
        "Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and \"WIN\" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money."

        "lnstaII \"VEARN\" App to start Earning GMES! Ref: (RAKA) I never knew i can earn money just by WATCHING Advertisements!! UNOPAY is a legit App that allows to earning point just by doing some simple tasks (like watch videos, watch advertisements and so on). Then you can exchange your points for Digital Gift Cards, and there're various options to choose from. Also TOYOCASH app is perfect for anyone in anywhere, who has free time but doesn't want to waste it, you can use this app while working, studying,.. simply earning points by watching advertisements",
        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

        "Good game but controls, sighting and movement, need to be better, more control and ability to move easily. Getting extra equipment after a mission is not very good, way to random and pretty crappy stuff. Also need to have better explanation on what you are getting, and that you have it, when you purchase upgrades after your mission. Need to be able to win any/more diamonds from completing your mission without having to buy, real money, them to get upgrades. Other than that it is fun to play.",
        "I would have given five star's but My fellow comrade that is following me to battle is shooting but  not killing any enemy. I'm the one doing all d whole job. And please increase ur sniper rage and damage. Ive equip my guns but still..... God bless.",
        "Very good game but when is the other two endless mode coming cos I have completed both mode. Are there anymore new level cause I have completed all levels up to legend. It's kind of boring to play all the levels again and again just to upgrade the weapon. I have two level 60 and 55 weapons already. Need new challenge please or I have to look for other FPS games and uninstall this one.",
        "Great game to play. Real easy controls, decent graphics. Easy to medium difficulty as you advance further into game. Weapons and equipment little expensive but that the challenging part is getting enough gold or gems to buy what you want. I like to work for my stuff, not just given to me for free. There is no fun or challenge then and game would be to easy to beat from the start. What fun is that. Keep up good work. Maybe one day that graphics could be better quality.",
        "Nice game, some bugs, but pretty fun, although it doesn't let U connect through Facebook or Google, it wants to save to the cloud which I hate  & don't trust that in the future, when I get new device, I don't trust I'll get my game back, so I don't spend any money with them. Might just be me,and my bias against the cloud.",
        "I wish campaign had more of a story... The audio goes faster than the slow-mo kill cams allow. All in all, not too bad of a time waster. Great frame rate so, nicely optimized.👍"

        "This game is very addicting and great time killer. I also like the tower upgrades. However, what I don't like is the idea of buying heroes using real money. Seriously? It's really tempting but I won't be spending ₱225 ($4.3) for a hero. I actually bought the cheapest hero for ₱75 ($1.4) because it's impossible to move forward without a help BUT I'm not gonna go beyond that. Will greatly appreciate if you guys will provide different ways to purchase a hero. Example, using coins or gems.",
        "Good game with graphics.. I used a trick n gain the weapon by coins n diamonds.  I never spent a single dollar for extra heroes. Completed all levels except the ice last level. Its hard but trying to complete fully by normal weapons... Need mind n patience to completed.. Took three months to completed.  First update ur weapons then go for mission..n have a extra weapon helper. This way only I completed all levels.except one",
        "excting game and addictive. however, the higher the level the more difficult it is. more creeps and more impossible to achieve than u could imagine. especially level 29. pls try to lessen enemies so we can enjoy it more",
        "Too many ads... And you have to buy to keep it exciting, otherwise it keeps on getting boring and slow... But good graphics, sound effect and cool weapons..",
        "The fact that you have to spend money to finish this game is highly annoying. Perhaps they should just have an option to outright purchase",
        "First few levels are pretty good. Later levels slowly become more pay to win until further progress becomes impossible without buying power boosts."

        "Its a shame. Specifically designed to mare you pay money by deceit.  Good game, great graphics, well thought out to be a long term game, however.....  once you lose your tickets you have to buy  new ones i cannot find a way (unless its won on the spinny wheel jackpot thing.)  Lucky it got as many stars at it did. - - update - now uninstalled. Bored of trying to get to the next continent",
        "I like the game but they make it impossible to win without purchasing tickets. You can only go so far then the game beats you every time. It should be more fair and allow for more options to proceed to the higher levels. I feel cheated.",
        "I always love GoP in PC version. But this one is not really. This game is actually not free. You can't progress unless you let your money out of your pocket. It even takes forever to get one free ticket. SAD!",
        "I spent many hours after this game thinking i can actually win Atlantic City. I was cautious, patient and made my way upto a heads up. I thought a 1-3 finish would be good enough but you actually need to finish first here in a 24 player game. I had almost the equal amount of chips compared to my opponent and then came this weird hand.  I had a pair of Queens, opponent had an ace and a 8. The flop was again two queens and an ace. With a quad and almost guaranteed win, I did bet all in. And, the opponent called. with what? With just two pairs. U people won't believe what came in turn and river. Two more aces. That made the highest quad for the opponent and I lost. Now, there was clear cheating in there. First of all, how often do you see two quads in a hand? Secondly, how could the opponent call almost all in with just two pairs?  The creators are cheats. This game should be banned from play store.",
        "It was too hard to pass a level. My opponent always had a better hand. If I got a winning card they just simply fold. Too difficult to win",
        "Game hangs on flush hit on river. Twice in two sequential games in Jacksonville. Sits there and doesn't announce the winning hand though you can access menus and such."

When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "I don't understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed.",
        "It is a really good game but I have 1 suggestion. Can you not make people waste lots of money. When people are rich in the game, when you die the game makes you waste alot of money and when you're poor, they make you waste little"

        "This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!",
        "Pls add on more levels... If it is possible pls update this particular game every month... But over all the game is awesome... But still my mother only play all the games she finished all angry birds games... She is asking more angry birds games... So I'm giving this as a request to u ...the CEO of Rio pls add on more games like this classic angry birds 😜",
        "This latest update keeps freezing up. I have to close it out completely and restart it. I lose any powerups I was using when it freezes, too. I cannot even finish playing the mighty levels the last few days because of this issue. Very annoyed.",
        "The game keep freezing up after the new update and have to restart it completely to play again. It freezes any time in the middle of the game and I lose my highscore ,powerups cause of this . It just freezes and couldn't start without restarting it again. I think this is happening after the last update cause I have played this before and never faces this kinda issue. Please fix this.",
        "This game used to be fun. Now you have to win stars and coins to do anything? Free to pay then play! AND not to mention, if it crashes;you loose all your stars,coins, and power up's! Just spent 3 hours of my life that I will never get back on a game I 'USED\" to love. Dont bother. Not woth it anymore!",
        "The Feb 08,2018 update has completely changed my opinion. The update makes the game unplayable for almost everyone now. I would have thought by now  that Rovio would have rolled back this version so we could play the game again. Obviously disappointing."

        "It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!",
        "After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. 😄  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it's time for me to kill more zombies 😎",
        "3 stars because although the game is fantastic in what it is, it needs optimization for slightly older devices such as my S7 Edge. I had to scale down to 720p screen res to be able to get a good enough framerate. And yes. I already tried playing on low graphics settings (in-game) before i changed my phone's resolution.",
        "I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn't have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time",
        "OMG. I definitely LOVE this. Better than the first. The storyline had me excited. Now it's more fun running with a goal. Love everything. I'm on the lowest graphic settings but I still encounter minor lags. Oppo A83. But that's fine. I love how you can name your companion. Makes it more personal. Good job!",
        "Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it."

Those spend less or not spend at all, hear this : you will be tempted to buy things, it would look as if with this purchase everything will be cool, but won't. I assure you. I have been playing for many months. In simple words a good game spoiled by the selfishness & hunger for money by the developers itself.

I am not a big gamer so I tried this game just because I was curious about playing a war game...and I got totally sucked in!!! Very fun!           JD07 - Server 86",
        "The game started off well... but over the last couple months, the creators have changed everything to the point of deepening their own pockets. Some players have even lost hundreds of dollars, due to glitches at the time of purchases and have yet to see a refund. They even bribe players to grant them a 5 star review, which I believe is against Google Play and Apple Play store terms.",
        "This game is awesome. I can't stop playing. You can buy lots of cool stuff but you don't have to spend money to play. Its extra fun to be part of an alliance and work together. Great game. 5 stars  BootySlayer: Server 59"

Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren't so touchy. Even if I'm using my stylus it's easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it's not the right direction.",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes",

        "Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don't work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!",
        "I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don't work right and they glitch out. I've been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can't complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed",
        "There are some major bugs in this game! The Facebook cloud does not work, because on an old device, I unlocked and beat every level and now it has reset it self completely. And the gates in the Road to El Porkrado levels are broken! They are off from where they supposed to be attached, making some levels impossible! And just today, every thing turned into an unplayable pink rectangle, making it fully impossible to play at all! Rovio, I beg of you to fix this! I love this game, but it is severly bugged!",
        "Very disappointed that I've had no response to my email and that there is no sign of a fix to the bug with El Porkado, rendering the levels uncompletable. Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have some of my actual money!",
        "level 18 in the road to El porkado (sorry if I spelled it wrong) is impossible because the grey platforms are out of place, even if I use the engineer pig I still can't get past it. also when I level up the bar goes back down again a tiny bit and I have to get more exp. the rest of the game works fine but please fix the bugs. anyway are you even listening to the other people, because I saw a lot of them complaining about the bugs. because of this you get 3 stars from me",
        "The game is really good but the bridge bug is annoying. I got stuck on a level and tried to reinstall the app but it did not work. It is so annoying that a really good game like this has a bug that prevents you from finishing the game. Oh and also, what is different about the HD version? It seems to be the exacted same."

BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I've had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Addicting and Rewarding! Even if you don't buy the premium version, there are still a ton of free packs and plenty to accomplish. This game will keep you busy and entertained. I don't consider myself a puzzle person but somehow this game got me."

It's a great time killer , you can get creative. Just o.e small issue is when trying to relocate any building or decorations it's hard to control that part. But it's AWESOME",
        "I love this game and would like to keep playing. But since the update I couldn't get into my stadium, the game would crash. Now, it won't even open. I even uninstalled it then reinstalled it, but it won't even open. It's just a black screen then back to my home screen. So, I loved it, but I can't even play it, so I guess I have to delete it :'/",
        "Well I was really enjoying the game until it was time to expand my storage (in lvl 7). The arrow pointing to the storage button with the guy on the left saying this one's free and I can't click on anything. Like it's frozen, but not frozen because things still get highlighted when going by them. What's the problem here?! Restarted my phone, cleared junk and other apps, ???",
        "I luv dis game most. Pls also add more difficulties to make roads, & buildings. Add some flyover, bridges in city's. Add some difficulties to construction in rainy season. Please make it more and more real as you can possible. Pls add more realistic things.",

The controls are simple and easy. Just save up on the crystals, it will help for speeding up reward crates or buying guns. Currently on Act 2 and it's been a blast. Can't wait til they add new modes",

        "The game is great. A bit slow in terms of getting coins to upgrade weapons, but still very enjoyable. However, the way you get extra cards from your crates is bugged, and has been for ages. Certain videos just play without giving the reward. So you might have to watch the same video 5-6-7 times before getting a new different video, amd the get your bonus. Already sent a message about this on Facebook, but no reply. So, 1 star until it's fixed",

        "Nice gameplay, story is assual as zombies are concern, but the most annoying part is every mission you have to buy your set of guns and upgrade it to finish the mission. You guys just want more money you son of a gun damn you you ruin a good game just to have money"

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

I am your typical anime lover and this chibi anime studio creator I see infront of my face and I am in anime heaven I love the you can make your own characters or build off of template characters made already and it just is amazing to use if you love anime and stuff like that and the best part? NO ADS LIKE COME ON YOU GOT A LOVE THAT!",
        "The characters are super cute. I have invited almost like 5 of my friends to play this its so much fun!!! Me and my friends reached so much levels by now. And its super addictive. &lt;3 love it!!! The best game in history. Almost making me not to play roblox anymore. Also people keep complaining lost connection bugs and everything its not their fault its yours the internet. So dont blame lunime.",
        "It's awesome, can make all my cool characters. Just a couple things I suggest: 1. Add piercings in accessories (ear, nose, ect) 2. Add more character slots 3. More \"scary\" things (sharp teeth, wolf/cat noses, ect) 4. Comic paneling. Like, make one scene, save it, make another and so on and so forth. If I CAN do that already, I don't know how too... Would be great if you did this. Thanks! ^ w ^",
        "Not a lot of games like this on the appstore! A fighting game that let's you customize your character? Exactly what I want but I can never seem to find. Then I found this game, and I never looked back. Unlocked all the pets, still working on beating all the levels but I'm pretty far (at least, I think I am. How many levels are there?) It'd be cool if you could battle other people's characters or teams, and you could get prizes for winning and stuff, or if you could use and customize special moves, but these are only suggestions. Can't really fix what isn't broken, can you? Overall I love this game to bits and can't wait to see what comes next.",
        "A few things you should add:  1.Add chibi people size  2.and like interactions in the studio like: hug,kiss, high five etc...  3.New poses or a custom pose  4. You can choose the color of you own oufit and Assoceries   5. Make them hold a chibi person like a baby  And that's all, hope you can do it all have great day",

Seriously download it... here are reasons! 1 so cute and anime 2 you can make scenes for youtube or for fun! 3 you can battle in the arena! 4 you can GACHA for little chibi creatures to battle with. 5 you can chat with people and see their avatar and your avatar! 6 there is alot of custimaizaition with hair,weapons,skin tones,clothes and what your charater position is! 7 Endless poses! 8 you put speech bubbles to make it look like ypur characters are talking!"

Second, please make their personality based on their true selves because it will make more realistic like you were texting them for real. Third, please make the calls more realistic and longer. But overall, the app is good, very good. Actually I love the app❤. Keep up the good work👍",
        "I LOVE IT!  I am an ARMY, probably been one for a year now. And that makes the game even better, knowibg the members and like their personalities are kinda the same. They are just really blunt and straight forward but I like it anyway. This game is so cute and it just feels so real! I was reading the other reviews and some said that the messages are the same over and over. That'll make me sad when I get there cause I just installed the app. But overall this is SO AMAZING. 5 star rating I'm not even joking. Keep updating this app! It has great potential. Also I think you should make more dialogues!✌👍",
        "It was a great game for \"relieving fangirl feels\" and it was enjoyable...while it lasted. This game, though fun, was short to the point where if you had enough hearts you could finish the whole game in half an hour. Also, ads, ads, ads. One after every conversation and call-way too much for me. The skip button made up for it though.",
        "This game is so much fun. Knowing that you are \"talking\" to them is so cool. The only problem is you only have a limit of conversations, and they say the same thing when you reset the game and pick a different member. The improvement I think should happen is more conversations and when you pick a different member, the conversations would be different. But other then that, this game is really addicting",
        "Its a nice app and i loved it but after you do every conversation theres really no need for it. It just becomes an app that just sits on your phone. And seeing the same thing over again gets irritating.",
        "I've been playing this for a long time now and I pretty much love this app! Ever since the update, though, I have to wait for 20 minutes each time I go in the app. It's really frustrating, because I can't play this app anymore. I would have given this a 5 star, but the update is horrible."

Well, aside from that, congrats to you guys! You've made a great and amazing game!  :D",
        "Wish there's a 10 star rating Cannot stop playing! With the amazing art, the cool sounds, great plotline and easy controls it's simply the best RPG I ever played. This game is a must to get! My only request is to make the 'movement button' more smoother, and that's it! Thank you for developing this awesome game!",
        "Amazing RPG! Haven't played an RPG this good in years! And it's on my phone. Paid packages a little pricey, not much diversity in what u can buy either: especially for mage class. Though I have bought few extra coins. Bonus cash every 3 hours is very awesome.",
        "I love the game. It feels like i am playing old ragnarok online. But some skills won't function. I have an assassin hero and most skills that i've learned out of those skill books won't work at all. I don't know if those spells are intended for the an assassin job class for for mages  I am having problems with the abyss ruina cave. I am already lvl 196 and i cant finish the quest even i killed already the shadow maker",
        "Great Game but... This is a really great game, but I really did not like the way you started the game. The first part of the game did not give off that RPG feeling (Well in my opinion.) but as you progress a bit more further that RPG feeling slowly builds up. Overall the gameplay is great, the controls are kinda unique for me and the story so far is amazing.",
        "Lost Data After phone restarted. Once downloaded, this game quickly became the only game I played on my phone. The dungeons are challenging. Building your character and finding rare items is insanely addictive. Easily my favorite overall game in the Google Store. But... every game I have keeps it's saved and sadly this did not. I can't give a high grade to a RPG that won't actually save the time you put into it."

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.",
        "Great game but it hasnt unlocked the next level even though it says you need 30 stars to unlock and i have 60 stars still will not unlock. So just disappointed i only got to play the first level."

        "Ok na ok itong larong ito. May mga ilang suggestion lang ako. Sana yung controls paki-improve kasi minsan kusang tumatalikod si Flavio sa mga kalaban. At sa health recovery, pakidagdagan yung amount ng health recovery kasi napakaliit lang ng naidadagdag.",

Ever since i came across this game, i rarely play any of it's related game because this game has shot down the strength of it's other related games and has really offered me the 100% utmost joy and  satisfactions required from it.  This game has an awesome features like beautiful background, images, and soon that could not be seen in any of it's related games, also any slightest click on it derives someone's attention to see the end of it, i also called it a powerful magical game because it can easily cheer someone up,  seeing myself running after the theif made it more interesting and making an effort to win puts an uncontrollable smile on my face. The more i play this game, the More i feel like talking about it because it's really fun to play, and my conclusion is \"this game is recommended for everyone including kids just give it a try you will testify like i did is all i will say to my fellow app users and other people out there\".",

Guaranteed to kill this game before it even gets off the ground.  Sad really, cause it has tons of potential. I enjoyed myself when I was able to play. Uninstalled though, too many Ad's, FoV is horrible. I might decide to give it a try at a later point if changed are made.",

Practices like this artificially inflate the overall star rating in the appstore making it just one more game with a rating you cant trust.

And when playing online, even I have reach perfectly the shooting meter it does not shoot rather it gets block. Meaning, it does leave the shooters hand only to see it fall beside me. The new patch has an issue on my old version.",

Reason im very dissatisfied is that the app got uninstalled somehow off my phone and when i logged back into my account all the balls i bought the stadium court all my trophies and MP were all gone.  My rank is still the same but all of my stuff is gone.  If this is fixable than please do so for me and ill rate 5* on everything.",

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.",
        "This game is horrible. THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS GAME HAD ONE JOB IT WAS TO MAKE A GOOD GAME AND THEY FAILED!!!!!! Don't download this game. The controls are horrible, the background is horrible and, the landings are not possible because of the background and the controls. UNINSTALL this game you are just wasting your time playing this game! UNINSTALL!!!!!!!!😲😠😾",
        "Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!"
