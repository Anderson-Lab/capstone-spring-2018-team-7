        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

Everytime I attack I see hammers going to the metre but the number there remains the same. I would have gotten 12 million and evemln more but due to this issue I haven't. It's definitely the fault of game. Please fix it as soon as possible.",

        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",

I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "After playing for three days, this doesn't feel like a Sims game, some actions and interactions with objects are meanless, why do I need to use the toilet? One of the key factors of the Sims is to fill their needs, what are the needs of these Sims? It doesn't care at all if I decide to not pursuing one of the stories with friends, hobbies or career. And where are their feelings? Their aspirations? If I follow two romantic stories,  those Sims don't seem to be jealous even if I'm dating them in the same room! This is a game for the money,  not to play a simulation.",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",

I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much"

This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

        "Fun game. I would like to see an update that includes sounds effects, music etc. I would also like to see different characters to choose from and/or customization of the character(s). Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "Fun off the bat... But then it slows down to a brutal snails pace. It's a great concept, it just needs a lot more updates!  *Slow claps* great work on the \"updates\". I shouldn't have updates in parenthesis.. The characters are cool, leveling is also a cool touch, and a whopping 7 new bats? Killing it!..? But come on, way to go extreme overboard on the speed! All the other bad reviews cover it better. I just wanted to also sarcastically congratulate your update.",
        "pretty good game, glad they're updating it and adding in more bats. I play it when I'm waiting at the airport. the new update sped things up, made it really buggy. resets your hits at 44000 M and isn't really playable at this point, hopefully it's fixed soon",
        "Latest update totally destroyed the game. Even using the basic bat hitting it perfectly straight it takes the ball 2 seconds to fly 100,000 meters and then the game resets back to swing again. Without even getting to actually make any currency for upgrades",
        "UPDATE: Every time I hit, the game resets it's self. I hit the ball the meters get up above 80k and then the screen goes black and then I'm back at the plate.   Any upgrades coming soon? I have all the bats and am over 30,000 meters. Need some more upgrades."

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",
        "Love the game but cmon guys, how many times are the race ranking going to get messed up. Finish first... But says you were second, second but now I finish third, third but wait... Fourth. Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",

I hope you make the main menu button apear immediately or allow you to click your back button to go to the menu of the game but other than that AMAZING game!",

It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",

When you win you get anywhere from 50 to 100 play money.  So you have to spend your real money to get your play money.  If you have money to spend then enjoy the game.",

        "Having to restart the app every time you want to play instead of being able to hit RESTART sucks.  The app won't let you restart a game without a glitched ball each time.  Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",

        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

        "Y do this game censored almost  every word?!?!It censored drink bleach,believer,graveyard, medicine,drugs,cocane, every type of medicine,Logan Paul,Jake Paul,Girlfriend and Boyfriend.And the most weird one.When I say 'gtg,my phone is overheat'. Then it put like this.'gtg,## ##### ## overheat'.Seriously?!It censored that?!Wow.Just wow.So dumb.It also censored 'BOIIIII'.",
        "Yes great job Roblox you had fixed the graphics now I can play on my phone thanks but if u can make the robux prices a bit lower that will be more nicer :D anyways thanks for fixing the graphics problem",
        "Still need to be able to see everything displayed on the screen for mobile and there's a bug in mobile that makes your screen flip upside down mobile users also need a new way to aim ranged weapons and use items there device won't support",
        "The games are great, but you have to get rid of Online faters. Some children that plays roblix may be in danger or hazard."

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Actually it is much easy and had very less features. It is not like a competitive game. In 2hours I have nearly unlocked 31 levels.  Make it a tough one....graphics is good but lots & lots of ads, very annoying ! And add scores there rather than medals",
        "This is a very fun game, even though the screen freezes almost every time I go directly to the next level. I have to close it completely and then reopen it - Please fix this then I will rate it 5 stars.",
        "Fun playing. Passes some idle time. Habit forming. How much more do I need to say before get something free? Lol...",
        "Meh!!! It not what i expected I'd like to do the training but also the 1 on 1 competition. If any1 know of a pool app. Hit me up.",
        "Great game....way too many ads. I would pay for an ad free version since the ads annoy me so much that I'm going to wind up uninstalling it."

        "I love the game and then when i saw that there was 3D projects i was so excited but they did not meet my expectations the controls were a little hard and the graphics were a little shady. Also there is a lot of adds i don't mind some adds but there's just so much so it would be nice if you cut down on the adds. Over all i really like the game i love that i don't need Wi-Fi to play this.",
        "Ghoulishness hzhdhdhdh VC Bob hzhdhdhdh hzhdhdhdh VC USD per the attached resume and cover and I will send a private youweirdo if you are doing well and that was the we can do it again but this is a nice day you can get the same thing happened to me and see if you have a nice weekend and I will have a good idea for a little while to get a good time to do this is an automatically by Microsoft outlook for iOS and room and the best way to do with the room and the fact I have to be busy and I am going be able but screen software to view the full image to open in full size and weight of the time to get it done by then and I have a great day room for the late response I got the email address to send me the link below to verify that the same as the one that was the best regards.. room was not able and the fact I am.",
        "Simply love it, if i may make a suggestion... how about providing an option to hide the finished works from the first tab? That way one would not have a lot of scrolling to do find a new piece to start. :) keep up the good work! 👍",
        "This game is AWESOME!!! and Everytime the game updates their app it adds more exciting options to playing the game such as creating your own pictures from your picture gallery folders or other of your downloaded photos from your picture galleries or saved photos. It's so much fun. I also find it to be a Great stress reliever for me. ThaNkS, pixel art app. I love this game, I find time each day to play... Very Relaxing 🤗🤗😀😀😉😉.",
        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too.",
        "Great way to relax or calm down. Lots of choices without having to earn game coin to buy more that only disappoint. Mix of both easy and challenging. One thing would improve over all play and that would be an easy way to locate any missed cells at the end of a puzzle. Having to scroll through some of those detailed ones to find one or two blanks can be a real headache! Other than than i think this is the best color game I have tried! Keep up the great work!!"

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",

The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "This app is great for passing time, I also love how you can play offline. Its very addicting as well. The only downside is that there are way to many advertisements, I can't even play one song without there being an ad",
        "I mean the game is great! But all of these add-on power up stuff always being added ends up ruining the classic game for me. I love the good original design, no power-ups or anything too extra. I don't use them and find them annoying. It's a great time killer, and a real challenege.  But, as said before, the game is going too extra and I don't really like it.  Playing it is fun, the add-ons are not."

I get it, that's how you're making money, but I'd gladly by an ad free version of this app. Super cure game and my kid loves it.",

I downloaded this for my 2 year old,  my 4 year old has tested the game out for me and is constantly hitting the ads at the bottom of the screen,  if my 4 year old does this then there is no way my 2 year old could play this without constant help with removing ads. Id happily pay to remove ads until there is an option for that im installing",

But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child.

Make an option to use those gems for shots instead of real cash would be nice but still earned 5 stars. Samsung galaxy note 8",
        "I think everything is fantastic about the game, but after this last update. The loading time is 20x slower if it loads at all. Galaxy phone. I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "Game sucks donkey *****. You play maybe 10 beginner holes and get chests that open in 12 seconds. THEN you play a normal hole and get a chest that doesn't open for 4hrs. You only get four chest slots so that means you can only win four holes then you have to wait 4hrs (or 8 or 12hrs depending on the chest you choose to open) before you can get anything for winning a hole. In two days, I haven't even played 18 holes. Guess you gotta have money if you wanna play. Thought I trusted the \"Editors Choice\" games, guess not.",
        "Love the game, but its not perfect. You could make the textures better and add more detail in each level bc right now they look empty. Also matchmaking is garbadge, and I get matched against people with much higher trophy counts and far better clubs... Fix this bs please."

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update.",
        "The fast rechargeable tackles should be removed.  The game is no fun now. Earlier I had to time my tackle perfectly so that I don't give away second balls. And same with the attack. I tried to get tackled in an area where I can win second ball. But now this fast tackle recharge has just ruined the game."

        "Its a super fun game and I liked it. But for some reason every 5 seconds an internet browser would pop up saying I had a virus on my phone. Checked my phone but nothing. It never did this with any other app even before downloading this. Only ever happened when playing the game.",
        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",
        "Fun game, very entertaining. Ads pop up too often, it opens my browser saying i have a virus. I cant avoid it and it happens very often. Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",
        "I wanted to enjoy this game. The advertisements randomly open chrome browser windows with a fake virus scan saying \"your device is infected.\" Its ironic in that the software that you're prompted to download is terrible adware that an actual scanner might flag.  It's quite persistent too, happening only after I installed this. 30 second video ads midgsme and adbars that just so happen to pop up and hover where you have to click in-game.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",
        "I did not play this game for a long time. I download it and I only played it for maybe 2 hours. I tried to play, but when I  was in the middle of the game and it froze and sent me back to my home screen. The controls I like. This is not the greatest game I have seen, but It's ok😐😐😞😞"

They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won..."

Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",

Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "More ads= more money, less stars= less money so you choose. Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

        "The game is fun and addictive, and it also has a lot of content but unfortunately there's a bug that hasn't been fixed which is the time. Sometimes on many occasions, the level starts with the time passed like 1-3 minutes. Say I want to get 3 stars in a level by finishing it under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. When I start it, immediately one minute and a half are past without me doing anything and I have to restart the level to get it to zero. Sometimes I forget and end up finishing the level with 2 stars because of that bug and having to restart the level once again. I appreciate your support and offering the game for free but don't forget to get a fix for this bug, please. Thanks 🌹",
        "I enjoyed that it is challenging but still easy enough to feel like it's not impossible. However, there is at least one ad before every level, and sometimes 2-3 ads will come up for each level and this will probably be the reason I end up deleting it.",
        "Fun addictive love it the music the side effects all of it even my six year old daughter likes this game it's fun it's challenging for her it's not your typical solitaire and she's only 6 years old and already she loves it the higher the level the more she said Love's to figure it out great game wonderful brain game for small children teaching strategies great job guys two thumbs way up",
        "Impossible to enjoy game play due to excessively intrusive advertising.  One can't even shuffle without being forced to watch another ad. Banner ads, long boring ads between each level, jammed into players brains (so the developers wish).  I am immune to advertising and simply tune it all out. My only reaction being to UNINSTALL this otherwise enjoyable game and warn others about it's predatory intent.",
        "You get an ad between every game, but its not annoying for me. They're easy to skip. They gotta make money somehow, right? Other than that, the game is really neat and fun to play."

        "Ads after ever single try, even if you only play for 5 seconds before you die. If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "What I couldn't even get taken to dinner before being forcibly bent over with ads? I mean with in 45 seconds; I downloaded, opened, played 2 games, and BAM! There it is. What, you couldn't even butter a brotha up? Hell I'd even been fine being lathered up with 10 minutes. Soo ok, I bite, i watch the ad. Attempt number 3 is going well l, bam I die. Tap to continue, well there's a 5 second cool down for revive I didn't notice at first. So I think to myself \"well that's probably what I watched the ad for.\" Wait the cool down, tap to continue. So I tapped, and BAM! ANOTHER AD. Hmm welp you wanted a rating and here it is. Give me about 5 minutes of gameplay before two back to back ads and I might consider having the game installed longer.",
        "DO NOT PAY TO GET RID OF ADS!! IT'S A SCAM...IVE PAID AND IT DID NOT WORK. EMAILED THEM TWICE NOW OVER A MONTH. NO RESPONSE AFTER THOSE ATTEMPTS. Great game but deliver to customers when they give you money VOODOO. And a simple email would be nice jeez",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "Paid to have add removed, no add were removed! Reading though the comments it's seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way. Bit of a shame as I wanted to like this game but it makes it impossible to tolerate for more than a couple of goes as the add pop up every time still!!"

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

Also have the app freeze just after I enter games and lose all the starfruit/gold apples it cost to play, but never even got to open that game. Super pissed and dissapointed.",

I got 1 dojo and 3 blades from daily challenge after that I played 15 days continueosly but I got only 5000 star fruit but no blades or dojos.

        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime."

        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",

My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",

Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!!

I wish you'd left in the settings so if we wanted the moving graphics we could have them. And, if not, the they'd be totally still and not distracting.  Make everyone happy that way. :,( Will be uninstalling this now.",
        "This game is stupid. It froze my phone n i  had to buy a new one for 4589 dollars. Dont waste ur time downloading this. If u give good comments n ur planning to play this game for the rest of ur life...... Well, in 2 days u will need a new phone n u will end up buying a new one. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME I REPEAT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME.",

        "Not like it   It is nice but not good. It has too many adds,it is boring too. If we do not rate it before so coming many time to rate it. Don't waste your time to download it.",
        "I believe that we need a game that is simple, has no limit  of time to play, and you don't have to compare your score with others.  You just need to beat your own best score if you want. It's killing time in a portion that you chose.",
        "Simple (which I like) puzzle game, yet gets really challenging in strategy thinking as it progresses, which is good if you want a challenge and aren't already mentally tired from work, etc. Easy on the eyes and has really pleasant nature theme on the edges with a bird song loop. Hardly noticed any ads, which was also really nice. One of the BEST free games to take your mind off things!"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

I will give the game five stars if you gracefully remove the \"hearts\" feature. I'm asking CM a question: \"Will you please change the game back to the original way we played it? And add new levels? 'The Easter' would be creative, and the diamonds can be eggs. How about an Easter Bunny line? I like all the new levels, and the new lines we can unlock. Can you add more remixes to the levels? There are only 3 existing remixes, if CM had forgotten.\"",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",

I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "The game starts off really strongly and the concept is unique and the music is fabulous.. but later on things get so progressively difficult it makes flappy bird look like a piece of cake... And in the later on levels there's not much sync between the music and the cube it's really hard to play... I enjoyed it initially but now I'm just going to uninstall it...",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads."

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I love this game. When my sister downloaded it on her iPad i was sooo addicted to it and now i am downloading it on my own phone!!!! I really recommend to try it at least for once. If you will do so you will not be able to delete it easily beacuse you will be addicted!!!!!",
        "Remove the villagers plz i hate that they keep coming into the house i build and dont leave i have built 10 houses for me and they just keep coming in and its really inoying"

        "Like so many other games like this out there it is\"pay to win\". This is nearly every \"free\" mobile game it there now. So why the 5 stars? A few reasons. A big one being that they do make the super currency accessible without paying via offers. Many of which rewards higher amount than what someone would come to expect just for making it a fair ways into other games.  Second is that the levelling system is fair and no content is truly locked for those who don't pay. It will just take you a little longer to get what you want if you don't but it won't be excluding you from the best content.   As for the game itself is alright. You collect heroes and you can engage in a variety of activities. From a campaign mode and it's associated elite version to random dungeons to guild wars, pvp, and a gauntlet. Overall you can kill however much time you want on this game. Once you start attaining higher levels you will find it easier to spend more and more time on content.  Finally as always I strongly recommend doing a Google search too learn best strategies.",

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

        "This is the best of its kind for mobile, and one of the best overall. The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST. FU!CKING FIX THIS LOGIN ISSUE!!!!",
        "Well they still have to grow but I think it's op. As I play a lot of CS:Go (not sponsoring)  then I thought this could help me because my PC stopped working.. Anyways graphics aren't great but good.. They aren't clean. Oh and last before I end this comment- when you complete offer for credits it doesn't give you the credits.. That's sad..  So yeah.. Just keep it up!! 👍👍"

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",

I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine..",
        "This game is all pay to play. You can't compete without dumping a bunch of money into it. So like an idiot I put some money into the game and sure enough. It matched me with guys 10 times stronger then me. There's no winning unless you plan to put a lot of money into it. Which I will not be doing. Uninstalling"

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is actually good. The biggest downside is that there's A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT to watch during playing. I know this is a free game, but c'mon! Waiting and watching minutes of the advertisement is longer than playing the game itself. Not to mention the conversation between characters in the game also took too long to wait and there's some things need to use real money before it can be explored.  This kind of game supposed to be fun and gives the cha cha feeling, but instead I get frustrated of waiting for the advertisement to finish before I can continue playing.  Out of all that, this game is great."

VEARN App is Iegit one which allows earning points just by doing simple tasks like watch advertises,videos and so on. Then you can exchange your points for PYAPAL/PATYM/Gift Cards and there're various options to choose from. Also \"VADZ\" App is perfect for anyone in anywhere who has free time and doesn't wana waste it, you can use it while working,travelling.. simply earning by watching advertisements,videos..",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "1 l. no more free heroes added,always add paid heroes. 2. no more free castle skin,need topup to upgrade castle skin 3. all latest event just for them who buy something in the shop , no free spin like 1 years ago",
        "The game is good but very expensive.  There is not much scope for a free to play players.  Paid players will keep burning you all the time unless you spend money to be able to survive.   However,  the most annoying thing is that the game has become too crowded. IGG needs to make new servers and there should be limit for the maximum number of players in any particular server.  It is really difficult to survive even for paid players with so many castles everywhere in the map.  You don't get enough tiles to farm and nowhere to hide.  I give a 5 star rating if IGG works toward this problem. Thanks.",
        "I Don't normally play war games or any pvp games, but this has so much more than just pvp and war, or those build it and wait games! There's basically games within your castle that you can play while you're waiting  to build stuff and so much more!"

        "The ads in this game made it unplayable. I used to love this game and I downloaded it to try playing again and I would get minute and a half ads after every third attempt at a level. It felt like nearly every time I failed a level it would ask me if the level was too hard and I needed a hint. This game is incredibly obnoxious to play with ads on",

        "Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.",
        "I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!"

        "I originally gave a 4 star buy now I am dropping the stars to 1. I have the cloud backup and after 1 day of playing everything was erased and I loss all my progress. Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

        "Animation still lags on certain jump scenarios and surely dont help at all  with going through the scenario  without failure of input from the player. Other than that its all good and gives plenty of chances to keep trying for your current objectives. Which is by all means what anyone would love to have with this kind of hit and miss game.",
        "I had it installed on my iPad years ago when it first came out. Enjoyed it then and I'm enjoying my return to it. You can see the refinements made and all the neat little additions. Great free game to kill some time!",
        "Hey, this is great. But it is really hard to get red rings and you can almost never get new characters. So, for example, to make it better u can do like 3000 regular rings instead of 30 red rings. That would really help",
        "I like the game but it's way too hard to get rings and you can't ever get the carachter in the daily spin wheel, make it so there are a lot more red rings to collect and I WILL rate five 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟s",
        "I'm back in the game once more, as I'm still ripping my friends apart on this game, bet no one else can my NEW high score now! Although I have a lot to catch up on this game."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

This game is awesome and all about tactics, and I love it. This game deserves a five star!🖒",

What matters is that there's a constant redirect ever 30 seconds! It sends you to a website and it's often and very stupid... And if a redirect isn't bad enough it no joke happens to me in the middle of game play. You can be playing and all the sudden here comes a redirect... !",

        "Was pretty good, liked the levels and the graphics were cool. The combonation of the colours on the black and white were quite nice. The only problem i had was when it came to the controls. Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "Great game most fun I've had on a mobile phone in years. Need to add wider turning radius so drifts are better and longer. Cars slide to much or maybe the cars are heavy? Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",
        "Wow. Great game. I wanted a good car customizer just for fun and this app takes it one step further. Open world game where u can drift and wreck into everything. Soooooo fun. Download now. No names on cars but u can still tell what they r. Soo fun.",
        "Hang it up yet info it yet info username and yet I've used back but isn't it is it is to see the in person but I don't have a Instagram account and follow me on Instagram account and I have a lot going I look forward to hearing back from you close by and I will be there for you close the door and it going to be thankful I look forward to seeing the new Star is it possible that I look cute and he is it is to be done by the time I look forward to seeing the new one and I can you know what time you are available",
        "This is a fun game. I'm still personally waiting on that police chase mode. Also, can there be engine mods and body mods, and some more low end cars?😀"

I REALLY miss the Chinese restaurant when I played that one I loved the doctor panda games and I really miss it.if you could can you PLEASE bring back the Chinese resturant.then I will love your games again😀😀😀",
        "Its a fun game but im very disapointes that you barely have anything to do they want you too buy so many things but it is a fun game but you can only make 2 dishes inthink maybe 1 but i was exspecting more from dr panda i love his apps i play them when i wanna play something but not harcore so if your fine with small content get this but if your looking for more i do not recommend this game but it has some good content you can season it however you want overall it was an ok game but i was expecting to be able to do more buts itis fun but if you want full content go to amazon underground or i think its free on this download toca kitchen 2 its great u make drinks as well thx for reading",
        "I'm sorry, but you guys are basically obsessed with money.I know, people need money for their needs, but why make a game free when we can hardly do anything?I miss the Dr. Panda Chinese Resturaunt, the whole game was free!Look, i'm not a cheapskate and the other people who disagree with the prices aren't, but y'know most kids play these games, and their parents aren't wealthy.Just please think about my comment for a while.",

        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked.",
        "I literally have nothing bad to say about this game. It's one of the best story/choices/chapter games out, in my opinion. I'm ready for sequels and the remaining chapters of Bad Boy Blues. Other than that, keep up the good work."

Why change something that wasn't broken!! 😡  UPDATE...since the second update the game is back and I LOVE it. Thank you so much for sorting it out. I genuinely love this game!!",
        "So frustrating to play since the update. Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",
        "The problem is the friends system requires you connect via Facebook. For people that don't want to, or don't have Facebook, you're screwed. Please implement a way to add friends inside the game rather than through Facebook harassment.",
        "The game has the potential to be very entertaining however the constant crashes and app failure is very disheartening. Definite work needed to improve these issues, now its saying the app may not be optimized for the device. Why wouldn't it say that before downloading? Try again!",
        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",

Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",

Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "I like the concept of the game in and of itself however the controls leave a bit to be desired. I will tap on an area a few times trying to locate an item to no avail then get frustrated, tap again and whatever object will move and item revealed. This gets old very quickly please fix it.",
        "Maybe it's just my phone, Galaxy S7, but even when i knew what to do i had to tap over and over again to get a response. Seriously, tap the object 10 times and nothing happens then tap it an eleventh time and it reacts. Very frustrating. Spent most of my time just repeatedly tapping the object. Game is a good concept, but really bad controls.",
        "I'm stuck! I must be around level#50 to 70 and the loading process is froze up.  Can't even get to the main menu, two days now. I've liked Challenge 1&2, but, HELP!"

        "The stories are really interesting and it is hard to out down the phone once you got into one of the story. 😂😂 Although I really do wish that it is more easier to get the diamond but overall I totally recommend it!!  Keep it up the good work!  😊",
        "I loved it so much😍😍",
        "Can anyone tell me what SNS is?",
        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

        "Total ad trap! It's fine if you don't mind the same mindless levels over and over and over, skill involved is holding back to drive over things better, what story? The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse",
        "Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can't back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",
        "I like this game but i faced a problem. When i tried to make a purchase of INR 89.99 for this game,  balance has deducted but no coins or other benefits added in my account.  What is that?  When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.",
        "Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can't understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It's mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It's mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",
        "My problem with the gane comes from some sort of bug that started like an ad mid-run, then it started doing some weird rainbow pattern that flipped 90 degrees every few seconds. Now the game doesnt function when you try to start a run and the problem even persisted to my home screen before I closed the application."

        "I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.",
        "Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating 'the option' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.",
        "I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the 'hints' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven't discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it's not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.",
        "Pretty good word search game. It's sometimes hard to hit the right letters, especially toward the bottom of the screen. Occasionally words share more than one letter in common. Sometimes  (especially in the  lower levels) a word will show up more than  once in a puzzle. Maybe extra credit for finding a word that's not on the list?",
        "It's a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don't find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.",
        "I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It's educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it's just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁"

        "What you expect from an idle game. Great time killer. Great customer support. I had an issue, which they addressed almost immediately. They stayed in contact, gave a time that an update should be in place, and even compensated me with a nice sorry for the inconveniences package. Which I wasn't expecting or requesting in anyway. So great game and better customer support than most other mobile developers",
        "Exciting at first, but its easy to lose interest after all the features have been unlocked, with no new ones to aspire for, just the same old things you need to upgrade. Will probably uninstall after a few more runs, but it was fun while it lasted.",
        "Well polished game but heavily reliant on ad revenue so there are too many ads. Way too many. I uninstalled after playing the game for about 20 minutes.",
        "Beware: Some of the ads won't close when they've finished playing, so you've to close the whole game and lose whatever progress you have made so far. Mediocre and repetitive gameplay that is not worth mentioning; have tried better ones.",
        "This game and the others from this developer keep eating up my device storage for some odd reason, even though I've moved them to my SD card. I can't free up that used storage by clearing the cache. It's probably all those video ads it downloads but doesn't save them on the SD card."

        "Educational and fun. Some of the gameplay has a bit to be desired. For example, in bonus area flags disappear as soon as they tell you what they are, so you cannot take time to learn them. Graphics are decent but style is a little dated and too ornate. That said, I still like to play it,  I'm learning from it and I appreciate all the effort that went into creating it!  So it gets a 5 from me.",
        "The graphics aren't the best and the set up isn't totally comprehensive. Some maps are so zoomed in that it's hard to recognize the general location unless you're already really familiar with geography. It could be more interesting, but the questions are good and it has helped me learn some.",
        "I'm extremely impressed by your app. It is not only fun, but it is the best educational app that has taught me so much! The border outline is the only thing that needs better graphics...otherwise I couldn't be happier!!! (An offline mode would make this app perfect) . Thank you!🙋💯💡👍❗🌠🏆💝☺",
        "Excellent game. Learnt lots. Ads frustrating but can be paid for. More frustrating is when you get to higher levels and constantly run out of lives. Find myself having to hang on 3-4 days between games waiting to accumulate lives to allow me to proceed further. That's why I have not given it a 5/5",
        "Was a great game, I learned a ton of geography. But now the ads are seriously out of control. Top players are really the ones who watch the most ads. Also, it would be nice if the encyclopedia allowed you to compare countries for a given category instead of only being able to view a single country.",
        "Excellent and really informative game. As someone who loves geography I learned a lot of new things. However I have just one problem to adress. Religion info on Bosnia and Herzegovina is incorrect and not updated, I've sent several reports but it is not fixed yet."

        "New Review because of update: ° I really love this game. I'm hooked. Relaxing yet stimulating. Some levels are easy as cutting through soft butter with lots of delightful bombs and others take several tries to master and need that one devise a strategy and some others are much up to luck. I love that variation: relaxing and stimulating and sometimes a bit frustrating. ° I had finished all the levels of version 2 and then waited for an update which came with new levels and I finished them also about 4 weeks ago. I've opened the game every day since to see if yet an other update came, and yes, yesterday it did and have already finished all levels (that says more about my fanaticism than it says about the difficulty of the game). ° I appreciate the tournament (I topped the monthly yesterday but had dropped 3 steps while I was sleeping and have clawed my way back to the top this evening, but I guess I'll be back down tomorrow. But it's fun!

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "I just bought a golden crate for 100 golds, only to get a muscle ECU uncommon part. Disappointing,  no blue prints. Even in a free crate you get blue prints.  Frustrating the reward system is horrible. Am never going to buy any golden crate. Players should be given choices to buy golden crate but you get trusted upon with useless worthless part. Otherwise good game",
        "Great game, accidentally spent 100 gold buying a crate I didn't mean to because they swapped them around in the recent update. Wish they didn't do that, but i guess I should've been paying attention. All in all love this game as far as an arcade racing goes."

        "The game is good, but there's one hilariously bad oversight that cost it a star. The leaderboards are useless because you can pause the game and still get on the leaderboard. And clearly people are pausing the game, solving it by hand or on a computer and then quickly entering all the numbers in just to get on the leaderboard. There are so many Hard silver times of under 30 seconds that is makes it pointless to HAVE a leaderboard. It's pathetic for people to do this just to feel like a winner for one be in their lives, to be sure, but the developers should have prevented. Most Sudoku games or similar-type games disqualify you for leaderboards if you pause.",

        "I would like this game if the ads didnt come with sound, but im usually playing where i need silence.  Since i cant play often, the controls are awkward because im not used to them.  Very different from other sudokus.",

        "Was more enjoyable to play before the update. Before I could move items I bought now everything I buy ends up in upper left corner. Cannot really even see each item. I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Can't create your own tanks,  things just get placed there and you can't move them. The game itself is okay,  but if you take more than two seconds to find a move you want to do,  it starts flashing a move hint,  and not the best move either.  Nothing different to make this game stand out from most match three games.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "Only wasted my time for a few levels then got rid of this pretty quick! Why waste your time completing levels, earning coins to buy stuff to decorate  when whatever you buy just gets a ll plopped down in one spot and cannot be moved. That's NOT decorating!!!! Fix that and I may be back.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average."

I dont know if anyone else has experienced what my 7yr old son has but on loading the game he was shown a flashing image of a man getting stabbed in the eye. This gqme has been removed and i have reported it to the video standards board that apply ratings on these games. Not sure how these things are even possible?",
        "I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it's very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.",
        "Love all the Lego apps. They know Legos are awesome enough that playing with some digital versions is enough to promote buying the physical bricks. ~~~~ NO ADS - Just Fun! ~~~ Even the adults like this one. It's comparable to minions paradise but with all the waiting and advertising removed.",

        "Really good game that my daughter loves. BUT - some bizarre glitch in the game means that the unicorn option doesn't load up properly, and when you try to put colour in its hair, the hair pixelates and you end up with a bald unicorn! I can't see any reason for it and don't want to uninstall and reinstall in case I lose my in app purchases that I've made. Would be good if Budge could fix this!",

        "I liked the game but most of the good stuff was locked. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING A MERMAID!!!!! And the worst part was you couldn't even get backgrounds for free. I mean, come on!!! But all an all it was pretty good.😀😀😀",

        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",
        "One of the dumbest cod ripoff i have seen and played in 2k18 so far. You need 20 bullets to kill someone with head shot. Dont waste your time with this dumb game. Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

This actually isn't valid as I just looked at each option to buy and none give the option of no ads. Plus I've made purchases and still nothing. I just updated the app and received the option of no ads. I clicked it and paid to no avail. Email has already been sent about it.",

The only thing ive noticed is the levels seem to have stopped introducing challenges and are sometimes just not possible to beat without serious coin. But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",
        "I really love this game. I downloaded it for mindless stress relief in between classes and it has not disappointed. Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",

        "This was fun... Until level 100 when they take away the ability to switch colors of the ball you're shooting. It makes it too difficult. I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall.",
        "While its addicting its quite easy. I've gotten 3 stars on every level and I've played over 200 levels already. Ive only had to replay a level that failed 3 or 4 times."

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "Way way WAYYY too laggy. It's an easy casual game though. I wouldn't say it's \"fun\" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That's it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there's no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.",
        "It clicks on adds with out me hitting it at all. Then when I get back to the app it forgets that I watched the add at all even tho I watched all the way through. It happens repeatedly. It only forgets half the time but it almost always clicks on the adds. Other than that it's a good time killer with easy ways to get through it quickly as long as you watch some adds."

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Awesome It's a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)",
        "Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!"

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it even went onto their Facebook page and explain but there was still no fix. I give this game 2 stars. No point in trying to advance if problem is not fixed.",
        "It's a great game.  The problem I have is you get screwed out of your prizes from time to time.  And then when you contact support you have to wait for 2 days.  Then you get a message assuming you dont understand how the game works and a thanks for understanding.  So the poor customer support is what got this game it's 2 stars from me and the prize screws.",

        "This game used to be fun, but now there's hardly anyone on it so you can never keep a volley going for long. Furthermore, it seems the only people who play anymore are the weirdos who just write the word instead of draw so you can guess, which makes the whole game pointless. Like, the heck, dude? They want all the points and none of the fun. Ruins the entire app because that's all you ever get anymore.",
        "It is interesting and addictive game to play with friends. I would have given 5 for everything but for some bugs. One is it takes along time to load. Two there is a bug where even if the game loads we cannot see the drawing. Please fix them",
        "Too many ads! I liked this game years ago, forgot about it and recently downloaded again. I would of hoped that things would of improved but no. The annoying \"do you need a bomb\" keeps popping up non stop. Wish they would of added more brushes by now since it's a drawing app, it just makes drawing much harder since I use it on my mobile phone. A paint bucket would also be nice instead of coloring the whole page.",
        "Redownloaded this game after not playing for a while and it's pretty similar to before, but the amount of push notifications is making me uninstall again. I have notifications turned off in the app, yet I still get a push notification what seems like every hour. It's so unnecessary. So I am happily deleting this app again.",
        "Needs a much better chat function. Can only communicate once per round!   Some of the words are ridiculously bizarre!  A lot of the words are repeated over and over again.    Oh yeah, STOP asking me if I want a free bomb! If I want them It's already very obvious where to get them!",
        "The game it's self isn't bad, it's the notifications that's annoying. Even if you turn notifications off you get them 4 or 5 times a day. It's pretty annoying."

        "The game controls are very annoying. The character won't go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",
        "Maybe the reason people think its boring. It's probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn't because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn't have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can't handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn't for you.",
        "These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I'm downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol",
        "NC and you know what you doing today beautiful lady and her husband to be with u but I can't wait till I see you in the car and my mom said she will be here for me to go to the store and get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get the money for the first time I was just wondering if you want to be a good day at work and I don't know what I",
        "This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn't make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I'm to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don't waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff",
        "I would get to the title page and that was it. It won't let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix."

It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they're inside of it, you're doing damage to the car, not to mention you can't even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!",

Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn't stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!",

The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

        "This game is very cool it teaches you precision, how to aim, how to breathe, and keep your cool under pressure. And it is just what it says it is it's just a game like we played When We Were Young remember Cowboys and Indians this is the same thing I had a slingshot when I was young I think every little boy did it's harmless. It does not teach your child to become a murderer.",
        "It's an ok game,a little ridiculous that you can't control the hand movements. I know it has to be a challenge but unless you have some sort of a nerve disorder no one moves like that!",
        "Great if you like spamming adds and flashing buttons to spend here and there. Game itself is a turd but I've had some amazing turds before. So whatever worse then turd is.. this game is",
        "It won't save to cloud and if you can't sign in you don't get online interactive play. Can't figure it saved once, got to play head to head, but no more....great game though.",
        "I am deleting this for several reasons. 1, the physics are not real. A person's hand doesn't move like that. 2, there is an ad after just about every level. Short, but still annoying. And 3, I think a company that can't take the time to respond to it's feedback isn't worth it.",
        "Like they say, good time killer. Easy controls. Keeps you focused on game. First game I've kept downloaded after playing a couple of times in awhile. Good game."

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons.

        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",

        "They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you're trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",

I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",

The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "This game is awesome overall. But some changes could be made like adding German league players (especially AUBAMEYANG though he's moved to England) and when you face them leagues top players( in the game) you could add the legends like Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others. Hoping to see these changes in the next update. Thank You!",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "The ads are very annoying and I have lost interest in playing  the game anymore. I have to start over for each play. Ad won't let me continue. Someone has Really messed this game up. Just fire their butts and send them down to the river swamp. No need for them to be in the public when they can't leave well enough alone.",
        "I think the game is great. I love Mahjong. I'm unhappy that I paid 1.99 to stop the ads but when I collect my 2,000 coin bonus I still have to watch an ad to receive the bonus. I will not be paying 1.99 next month just to still have to watch ads.",

        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

The reason I gave it only 1 star is just to seek your attention because I wanted u all to add an effect of sound of engine as the car speeds up which will make the game really more realistic. I really loved playing this game but if u add that effect, it will make the game more interesting. I hope u add some more realistic effects in the game. Again I say that I gave it just 1 star to seek your attention, otherwise the game really worths a 5 star........Thank you.",

        "03-23-18: HOLY SHEET THE SCI-FI UPDATE IS CRAZY AMAZING! Outerminds has done it again! I wish they made more unique celebrations (like SciFi) other than Christmas or Valentine's in the future, such as Easter or even a Video Game Mashup update. It is time to rewrite my review!  So far, it's my favorite time-waster in my device. Never utilizes the Pay2Win paywalls for the most of the time (It's one of the best non-Pay2Win apps in the era of Pay2Win), and never crashes at all! Bugs aren't frequent! There are easy ways to save Bux and Brains in the game, which gives almost every player the opportunity to customize without any problem.  The game is hugely customizable. It's like being a home designer and a Tuber at the same time. There's lots of different customization options for your room, Tuber, and stuff. I also love to switch to a certain theme during events like SciFi or Valentine's Event.  And next, the videos. You can name your videos whatever you want, and you can select a combination of genres. You could make hilarious titles like \"PewDiePie Plays His Game\" or \"Edgar The Rapper\". And then you can pretend to act them out.  One of the best parts of the game is that there are almost no annoying popup video/banner ads, unlike in most games I've played like Vlogger Go Viral. The only way to view them is to simply go for a free shipping boost by watching an ad (which does not interrupt gameplay. Watching ads is also in Quests too, and it's fine as well.)  I like the Puggle minigame as well. It doesn't make the game feel boring as it can help boost shipping time while being a playable Pachinko with Edgar and Maya.  The game's community is also very cool. No cancerous fights or something, many players of this Tuber Simulator mostly focus on hatching Pixelings, participate in room contests, and get tips on how to grind Bux! Check out the Google+ semiofficial community as well.  Probably the greatest Tuber game on the web, Outerminds. I'll send you a Sponsor Eagle filled with \"Good Job\" messages. Keep your game as good as possible, there's no time to lose in beating PewDiePie to his #1 spot!",

        "Nice game but the random number generator is non existent. Hold three numbers and roll again, even with free or earned additional rolls, are ALWAYS the same number that was there! This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",
        "Love the game! But recently did an update for the app now my game glitches out. Takes forever to roll the dice. Only updated the app cuz it said they fixed bugs & made faster well it did the opposite for my app.",
        "Showdown is a joke!  100% guarantee opponent will get a double Yahtzee every single game.  Their average score is 320+ when a normal person scores 250-275.  Impossible enough to score a Yahtzee yourself but double is almost unheard of.",

        "It's OK I love to play the game when I'm bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I'm offline. But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "I don't know why the controls have a 3.7 rating, they're actually pretty good. The gameplay's decent and the graphics are too. Btw I get over 600 score everytime just to let you know because the controls quote on quote \"barely move the car\"",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",
        "THIS GAME IS THE WORST!!! Save yourself some time and DON'T install this thing I can barely move the car so please make easier to control. I know your trying but I,m sorry I,m uninstalling this game.",
        "It's stupid. It's really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn't turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked."

Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",

        "Candy crush is an Awesome addicting Game, Same with soda. Jelly is fun, BUT!, It is the most cheating game I have ever played. The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

        "TOP GROSSING!?! YES OF COURSE, bc WE'RE ALL STUPID! I'm playin a level w/ the Monklings, like 124/6 if u watch closely if u catch a long, 6,7,8, row on Monklings KING WILL NOT ALLOW U TO HAVE THE WHOLE row. Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

I can't even play with guys on my own squad now.  I used to love this game but until they fix this issue this game is weak.",
        "This game is dumb takes a hour and half to download after the download from the play store.. Then when asked to put ur name in u can only use latin characters and numbers whatever that is. This game needs work don't download.",
        "New update gives the larger maps a hazy foggy look and you cant see into the distance.  Zombies is fun, can't get too far as they seem too strong. Aliens is cool. Would like to see a different method for switching guns. If i swipe on android i accidently swipe and my notification bar comes down instead. Need some better  algorithms for matches. It's tough to get into a match with some super over powered weapons...or are they modding? Would like to see an in game reporting/tagging system for obvious hackers.  There are several who frequently hack and don't get booted from the game permanently.",
        "Once again a mobile game that doesn't get it ! Besides the gplay store download there's another almost gig download  my question is how am I supposed to straffe one finger aim with another hold device And then hit a shoot buttons without stopping to become a sitting duck ?or not aiming maybe this was made for an octopus? .",
        "There has been some troubles with the new update The app logo is of an Android and the maps is not complete some areas doesn't load unless we visit there finding it hard when playing as a sniper please fix it  Thank you",
        "The game maps are so low quality AND don't Produce Visuals at long Ranges On My OnePlus 5T after this last Update (can't even see the players at Normal Distance)"
