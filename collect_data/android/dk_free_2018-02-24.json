      'I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'You have to expect some ads in free-to-play games but ads that cause input lag and interrupt gameplay are ridiculous, especially in a game where timing is important. The game also crashes occasionally during the xp increase.',
       'I really do like the game. There are two things that get to me however. Knives should all have individual names other than the boss ones. There are also alot of ads, I do understand they need to make 💰. Otherwise the game is great.',
       'I bought the remove ads purchase and it screwed me. I still get adds and i still have to watch videos to remain in the same level. I want my money back since the game is the same. DONT BUY THE REMOVE ADS PURCHASE.' ,

      'I love this game!  It\'s challenging yet not too complicated.  With some games it gets so difficult to play the higher you go and very dew helps are offered for free. This game is still fun and challenging but the levels are not impossible to beat. They also offer ways to earn helpful tools to assist in beating the levels.  The community is great also. You are able to request and give extra lives to one another very simply with minimal interaction Try it and see for yourself!',
       'At first, this is a fun little puzzle game. The levels are entertaining and simply addicting. But... This game takes quite a turn. I can\'t say for sure when it began, but I\'m on level 85 and it has become hilariously impossible to proceed. The levels become so ridiculously difficult that you need to spend real money to move forward. In other words, simple fun levels to get you hooked, followed by insanely difficult level to get you to pay. Over all, fun for the first 20 - 40 levels. Enjoy it while it lasts.',
       'Very fun and entertaining. I really like slow paced relaxing games and this is just that. There is no time limit so you can play at your own pace. Also there is minimal ads for a free game which is part of what makes this game so great. Such a great game for killing some time in a waiting room or just sitting at home trying to pass the time. This game truly deserves 5 stars. I love it!',
       'It\'s a fun little candy crush clone.  Nothing special but a good time waster.  I rated it as low as I did because of the lie they feed up about  the word random.  Tiles and rocket placement arnt random by any  means.  They say it is but random constitutes moves that work in your favor once and a while.  Ive spent DAYS on single levels.  If you need a rocket to point down, there\'s a good chance it\'ll point left/right.  You want that yellow tile, not happening.  I\'m all for the challenge.  I expect it.  But make it random.',
       'I do enjoy this game but certain levels don\'t give you enough moves to complete the level. The ones you have to match the cubes with the colors makes it impossible to pass when the game doesn\'t give you moves to do so. You waste your moves on areas that doesn\'t give you the opportunity to pass the level and then you don\'t have any moves left before it does give you the moves you need it does get frustrating you get stuck on that level and can\'t pass it. Which will just make you want to unistall the game cause you will never leave that level.',
       'Loved the game ...until I lost all my progress. The game used to sync without linking to Facebook...not the case anymore. I spent quite a bit on extras and lost it all. Was told to link to Facebook.. Facebook book don\'t need to know my game play .. I\'m sure there is some monatary reason these greedy idiots changed this. We\'ll go with God you will NEVER get another dime from me. Hope your greed bankrupts you!' ,

      'This doesn\'t do the TEKKEN franchise any justice, controls are awful (mash one side of the screen), the layout of the title screen is painful and the fighter unlocks etc are daft. I would rather pay a larger amount for a proper TEKKEN game than this. To add insult on top it\'s just crashed and not given me the fighter it was unlocking.',

      'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I loved the game until the last update. Until then, I found it relaxing and challenging. Since the recent update it\'s just aggravating.  The boosters don\'t act upon the same set of rules since the update. I\'ve been on the same level for nearly a week. I\'m on 280, and looking at the number of tasks coming up makes me feel that I will likely uninstall rather than spend my entire life playing. I wish Playtrix would go back to the older version.',
       'Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!',
       'I delete it then loaded again 7 months later. No change. Still hard as heck. Can\'t get thru the puzzles even with using 30 lives and no power ups. I can see you don\'t care about people and your gonna lose money. You have to be a freaking genius to play this game. And we ain\'t.',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers' ,

      'I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don\'t do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE\'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn\'t know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I\'m always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty .',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao' ,

      'Once an ad on an app tries to trick me with a fake virus warning I\'m done with. Even without the fake virus warnings the ads do not give you a chance to say yes or no, you are taken straight to a site the Google Store. I find this extremely rude',
       'I really like the game itself but just now I after hitting the "Get Coins" button a webpage opened up and redirected a bunch of times then I got one of the fake google error pop ups about a "dangerous virus" that i needed to "click the link below NOW". So users please be careful, it looks like the apps advertising partners might be a little dangerous.',
       'This game is fantastic! The style, sounds, and music set a fun and cartoon-ish tone, and the gameplay adds a sense of tension and suspense as the player does not know what the next obstacle will be and cannot stop the character completely as the sausage continues to walk onward. This game is fun to play and hilarious (specifically the sausage\'s dying cries/animations), and the obstacles aren\'t predictable, but the pace is initially too slow, making the game a bit boring at the beginning. I would like to see a game mode that increases the pace right from the start, like a speed mode, and new dying cries/animations and obstacles in future updates. However, as the game is right now, it\'s a lot of fun. Definitely recommend.',
       'Cute and funny, the music is catchy and its a nice touch to make its pitch and tone change when you change sizes. the gameplay is simply and yet the timing makes things challenging. The art style is awesome, i am  reminded of early era nick toons IE Ren and Stimpy, or Rocko\'s modern life. All and all its pretty awesome. The only improvement i would make is a option to pay for removing ads. But hey awesome game. EDIT/UPDATE just noticed that there is the no ads option if you buy the starter pack.',

      'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 32 and I have 1.092 aa gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ,

      'This honestly is an awesome game. The game itself is worth playing, but there is an ad every. Time. You start a new game. Im not exaggerating. That and even when you have your tower entirely balanced, one block, which should fit perfectly, falls and somehow displaces itself and screws up your whole game.',
       'Great game but too many ads, one after every level or loss and most are 30 seconds long and the same few over and over again. Really annoying, to the point of unplayable. I don\'t mind watching ads but it was too much. Plus it\'s really unstable, like no laws on physics, it\'ll get wobbley even if you do it perfectly balanced.',
       'Good game but too many ads. There is an ad after every time you play. It even asks if you want to watch an ad to continue, and if you say no it still gives you an ad. Also the blocks bounce too much.',
       'This game itself is really fun and I like it, but it has way too many ads. There\'s is an ad every tinge you lose and sometimes just randomly. On top of that, its the same ad every time.',
       'The concept is great but it needs an update especially when dropping the blocks as it becomes unstable after a while of building it up even if each row of blocks are level. Would make the game better if fixed.',
       'I like the game but I dk not like getting the same add over and over I am fine with adds just i\'m not a fan of repeating them over and over so if you could put less adds or get diffrent adds then I\'m sure lots of people would like the game better that way.

      'I am not getting shields...  Whats the problem..  Either it gave me just 1 shield in 50spins or no shield in 50spins...  I am stucked on 1farm i have completed many times the same constructions but as i dont have shields neithr i get them people come and attack on my field again and again. Please fix!!',
       'I love this game. But please increase the numbers of spins every hour. And I also have come across one more problem- I get notifications saying that I have won spins and coins but when I open the app there is nothing or no way to collect my reward. I don\'t know what to do?',
       'Game requires you purchase junk to proceed. There comes a point where the casual gameplay is passed by the amount required to progress further; either watching hundreds of adds to collect enough coins to move on, or simply emptying your wallet. Good for a few levels, that is it.',
       'how awful. need to buy building upgrades. building upgrades do nothing. buildings do nothing. literally do nothing. how do you get money? spin a slot machine. Thats the only way. There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',
       'In a sea of idle and casual games, it\'s easy to find mechanics that are fun and engaging. That makes the utter failure of this game to be even slightly enjoyable while still asking for money minutes after installation somewhat impressive. It takes real effort to make something so terrible, but this company wasted no effort in creating something with no redeeming value whatsoever.',
       'Love the game but it restarts every time I try and watch a video for spins/coins. Also restarts when I try and invite friends to play , and trying to gift send or accept. Might have to delete and find a new game' ,

      'Its great and all,  but it still have a thing I hate most---the way to get robux. Not every people can buy those robux, so why don\'t just complete quests to get robux instead,wouldn\'t it be better. It might not only attract person to play this game often but also get robux more easily...',
       'It\'s a awsome game I like it.but I am a chrome book user u have knocked people with chrome books out. 1.st the controls. apparently, on Chromebook to roblox you go backwards instead of forward and forward instead of backwards. and the rotate you camra it walks that way. 2.nd aswell, you can not see your mouse when your moving it. and if you hold your moving keys then let go apparently, it moves on it\'s own? I haven\'t play roblox since 2 months and 1 week . please fix this I love roblox and if you fix this it will be full rating from me',
       'I love this game with a passion. ive played it since 2012, but ive made many acc n my official main account was made in 2016, id like if you can get certain games that are used for pc to go on mobile, it would be better',
       'I downloaded Roblox a long time ago, and haven\'t gotten to rate it because I\'m so busy playing it. Anyways, it\'s just really cool that it has millions of different games to choose from. That chat filters sometimes are a little annoying, like saying some words and Roblox chat filters hashtag it, but we find our way around it. Thank you so much for making this game.',
       'I recommended this game to all my friends.  I also recommend this game to everyone who is hesitating to get this game. Really big slection of gmes to play from roleplay games to obbys. Definitely get the game. One thing i dont like is if you don\'t make an account your called a guest and people are mean and bully the guest.',

      'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'tl;dr: Good game mechanics.  Ads are the worst ever, and the pay to remove them doesn\'t work. Would recommend if you don\'t mind watching long ads constantly.   Review: The base game is awesome. I love the mechanics and graphics. If you want a solid game, this is it.   However. I REFUSE to give this a good rating for 2 reasons.  1) The amount of ads is outrageous. I get they need to keep the lights on, but come on I don\'t want a 30 second video every time I "die" 2) I was willing to pay for the game to get rid of the ads. Well, don\'t do that. It doesn\'t actually work. I restarted my phone, reinstalled it, and did the force stop to confirm it wasn\'t a minor glitch. If you\'re going to have a pay to remove ad feature, make sure it works. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Google.',
       'W way too many ads, I even paid but I still got relentlessly slammed with ads. Poor game play, their angle is way too picky. If you don\'t hit those hills just right you lose and it\'s time for another ad. Poor knock off of tiny wings. Poorly made game, too many ads. Over all. Suck city',
       'I really like the game actually but I paid to get rid of the dumb ads and yet everyother frickin game more ads. If you pay to get rid of the ads the shouldn\'t be any. NONE So they took my money and gave me nothing for it so to me they kinda stole my money. To me thats not right. How many people are they takimg money from without fulfilling their end.',
       'I wish i could rate 0 stars, when thus game first came out i played it but got bored pretty soon. Alot of people are playing it at my school now so i decided to try it again, well what do you know the game isnt even starting up now. It goes to the voodoo screen and exits out the app. I already tried downloading it some times and from different sources. Not good...',
       'This game is really fun. The only thing is that there is way to many ads. A good tip is to just put your phone or tablet to airplane mode so you get no ads. There is still problems with the game other than just ads. Like no audio and when I\'m playing challenges and it takes back to the the menu. Other wise fun and addictive.' ,

      'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.',
       'The latest version is so annoying. On the sniper arena, my men get killed immidiatly at the end of the countdown to begin. If i even shoot any sniper he wont die rather it will finish it shoutout and then turn to my soldier and kill it. I hate now i hate d game. Please do something about it.',
       'This was a fun game at first until I got to a mission that is impossible to complete. I have the Target directly in my crosshairs and my shots go right through him. The hint only tells me he\'s too far away but he never gets closer. Also the price for premium is ridiculous. Uninstalling.',
       'Yeah man cool game, however we must ask ourselves if weed is a gateway drug maybe shooting games are a gateway to more sinister things but no one give a hoot about it hahahaha I like playing games. Hi, 5 stars. Food next 2',
       'The basic concept of the game is fun, but like all games these days, micro transactions are rammed down your throat. I would be fine if that was all but then they time gate you with the weapon upgrades you need for missions and lock content out for you unless you\'ve paid for a better level of gun. Avoid this one.' ,

       'A simple game that\'s like a modern version of an old school racing game I played. It\'s cool for the most part but it is lacking in the department of how to earn money. I wish your developers could add another way to get money than just multiplayer after you complete the career mode. It\'s also incredibly hard to find parts to cars you want without gems. This is mostly a pay to win game, I know but you already have a ton of ads so why make the game less enjoyable by having only two ways to make money? One is temporary and the other is permanent but you earn so little. I still enjoy the game but consider what I had to say, thank you.',
       'Its overall a great game. I like the tracks and the cars. I just wished you could re-earn money by replaying tracks, but put it at half amount that way it gives people that dont want to spend money on the game a chance on singleplayer.  FIX THE LAG because you finish in first and you end up getting second, third or fourth because of the lag.',
       'Game is good. Do not even waste your time paying to get rid of ads. They will rip you off. I paid to get rid of them and you still have to watch videos to claim your money that you won. You have been warned. Would have given five stars if it were not for admin stealing money',
       'Finish race in 1st place. Waiting for rewards. Loading... Sudenly I\'m in 4th place and \'didn\'t finish the race\'. -40 trophies. Simply ridiculous  Also, fix the checkpoints. It\'s frustrating to get thrown back so much when all you did was get a little out of the track.' ,

You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn\'t bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don\'t waste your time or money on this company.',
       'One of the best "tap" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that\'s NOT fake news.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Good game but you need to fix your ads, half the time they either crash the game or they won\'t load and freeze the game so you have to restart. Also the game will randomly just close sometimes for no reason. Enjoy the game but there are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out.' ,

I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.',
       'I wish I read the reviews before I downloaded this "game". Absolutely awful. Seriously, don\'t waste your time. If you like a stupid amount of ads and you are a fan of being bored then go for it.',
       'This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don\'t take it away from me. It is beautiful.' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service 🤔 no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'I LOVED this game before the update .. now it won\'t even let me play it because it keeps telling me to please update it. That wouldn\'t be a problem only that it IS updated ... my phone got the update and is playable but on my tablet it won\'t update and in the app store it says open or uninstall so obviously it\'s updated.. I like playing on my tablet because it\'s bigger and easier to see .. PLEASE FIX THIS !!!',
       'I hate that we don\'t have unlimited lives.  When I double tap my food goes to the trash.  When it should only do that if its burning or tap on the waste bin. Oh and these new challenges are extremely hard why can\'t we get a tutorial on how to make the food 1st?  Other then that great game and addictive',
       'It is a great game and very fun to play but just needs a little more to it. The one thing I can\'t figure out is why do we keep getting coins if we can\'t use them to purchase anything after you get all the upgrades on your ingredients. There should be a use for them or stop giving us coins in the rewards of each day. I wish there more things to buy or if the coins could be transferred to the next level or something. Okay thanks. P.S. I was just enjoying this game until you guys decided to cut my cup cakes down to 25 only so that means I have been saving mine only to know that after I use them up I can only get 25 at a time well that sucks and I hope you change that back if not my time with this game has come to an end.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!😡' ,

      'This is my favorite game. Absolutely love playing it whenever I can. However, why did the the flower growing from beating levels suddenly switch from starting on Friday, so we can enjoy it over the weekend to starting during the beginning of the week. Did not get to use my 6 hours of unlimited lives like I have been since this started. I would very much like if it could be switched back to the original timeline. Enjoy unlimited lives and contests over the weekend when it\'s more likely more users will have the time.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'Playrix games are all generally the same.. They\'re good. But well designed to ensure and encourage the use of real money to play. Think of old arcade machine style of game mechanics and you\'ve got a general idea of what you can expect from any of their titles.  The only thing truely different is how quickly each game decides it wants to dig for your wallet.  Disappointing.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.',
       'I enjoy playing this game but I think 900 coins is crazy for 5 extra lives. There are other games I play that offer less coins and a boost for a smaller price. On one game I play it\'s 65 coins for 10 extra moves and a boost, on a different one it\'s 25 coins for 5 extra moves. I also think that stars for each level should vary too. For harder levels it should be 3 stars, for medium levels it should be 2 stars, and for easy levels 1 star. I\'ll continue to play no matter what, it\'s fun, challenging and strategical!',
       'The first thing that comes to mind is that you guys have gone above and beyond on this one!! It\'s so much fun!! From the interactions of restoring the grounds, to decorating them (custom, might I add !!)    To the actual sounds the game makes while playing.. I can\'t stay off of it. And yes I\'m constantly tempted to purchase coins when I can\'t beat a level, for like the 7th time!!  Haha 😂 Great game guys!! We would ALL appreciate more gifts than currently available. Especially for your daily addicts, 😁 Forever a gamer.     Xx' ,

I recomend this game to everyone, i realy love that you can play it offline and with other players! Even if the gamers at school say this ias a stupid game, i think it is fantastic!.I live that you get candy powerups everyday instead of using your gold too!',
       '... endless levels. But the spinning wheel IS A JOKE! JACKPOT CAN NEVER BE REACHED! Besides, the initial loading screen takes about 15s... and then the main game start screen about 20s, while it connects online. Please improve this, very annoying. Thanks.  Update 02/2018: "Tap to Skip" animations after level finished - love it !!!!',

When I login with Facebook I have to start from the beginning. Kinda frustrating when I am at level 1183 on my kingdom account! I emailed for help and was sent to a the community site which does not have a solution to my problem anywhere. Please correct this!',
       'I had to take away a star. Ever since the update when I get a color bomb when I go to the next level and I get my free color bomb it\'s like if you use one of them they both get used and I don\'t even use one of them on a striped candy or a wrapped explosive. I thought I was doing that at first but when I look at the board before using it and then use one of them they both get used. It\'s like I\'m getting robbed. I don\'t mind being on a level if I run out of time or moves but don\'t have me stay on there longer than I have too if I can use my special candies to get off a board. Please fix',

      'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are \'rolling points\' that I haven\'t figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different \'skins\' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I\'m having fun. Maybe you can too.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',
       'I love this game and I just start playing and I already have the iron ball!how cool is that!..........but there is ad after I pass every levels.If you can please fix this thing! :)',
       'This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game.',
       'AMAZING !AMAZING ! OMG I NEVER PLAYED ANY GAME LIKE THIS    I HAD BEEN PLAYING THIS AWESOME GAME FOR 1 YEAR......  😆😆😆😄😄😄😄🤗🤗🤗😍😍😚😚💯💯💯💯' ,

      'Awesome game controls are just great but the only thing I didn\'t like was that the balls other than the normal one was for real money u guys could make the others balls for diamonds that we get during the gameplay  so we could also actually make use of the diamonds  otherwise the game is awesome👍👍👍',

      'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'The game is decent but this game developer loads all of their games with like 4x the ads of any other game developer. They are money hungry. And one of the other games they made called "Dune!" When you pay for the ads to be removed it doesn\'t even remove them. That game has just as many ads as this one. It\'s quite sad. Also when you request a refund they don\'t reply and Google will decline your refund request.',
       'Way too many adds. The game its self looks rather fun. But after 5 minutes in the game, and spending 3  minutes of them watching ads it was time to delete. I have no issues in watching a couple of ads to help the developers, but this was way over the top. Other than the ad frequency though, looks like it could be fun.',
       'Fab little game, but can you speed up the ball after it hits the ground the first time? It can be so slow & tedious lol  Oh & people need to STOP complaining about the ads & just turn off their wifi/data ffs! Ads are needed to pay for the app that YOU GOT FOR FREE!',
       'This game is incredibly fun. Until you get hit with a million ads just to play the next round and cost nearly 4 bucks to get rid of them. Shouldn\'t have ads that go for longer then the actual gameplay, its borderline ridiculous.',
       'It\'s ok. The game is fun, but they didn\'t give it any substance. I\'m not a developer yet I see so many missed opportunities. Would be better if you could get powerups, say to make the ball really bouncy. Another thing is houses. I don\'t think you can break windows with the ball. That\'s disappointing. You should be able to and get some sort of bonus. Fun little idea, but lacks real substance. Also way too many ads christ' ,

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it\'s actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn\'t a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it\'s great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.',
       'Hi Hay Day Creators! I personally love this game, it\'s very relaxing and a nice way to kill time and does not use a lot of data.

      'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!',
       'Good game I figured out why I couldn\'t buy the bikes anymore😹 Anyway sometimes it gets a bit laggy but it doesn\'t last for to long. I told my friends about it and they love it it\'s fun to play when you\'re bored. All in all a good game:) Edit: Game:Score between 54 and 58 me: *scores 54* yes! *waiting* Game: doesn\'t count Me: great.' ,

      'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.' ,

       'Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.',
       'Fun simple game burdened by a slew of constant advertising. Ads while you play, full screen timed ad when you restart (99.9% of time) and an optional 1 time 30s full screen ad to resume. Simply put too many ads!',
       'Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn\'t be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!',
       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..',
       'Fun game but way too many advertisements, which happen to blow through data. I\'ve spent about 1 hour playing the game and have gone through 224mb of cellular data. There is a 30 second ad after every single restart. Even if you goof up and get a score of 10. It\'s horrible. I have to turn off data in order to play the game, and then I can\'t do a 2nd chance. You neeeeeeeed to cool the ads' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ,

VEarn points equals mac instead of like some of the others where it takes McEarn points to reach vac etc....Also, łnstaII \'TOYOPAY\' App Enterr (BCNB) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Toyopay. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',

Y\'all ripping us off with these tables because it said unlocked at level 19 then I go to buy the table it say unlock at level 22 SMH I\'m on level 20 & I only got 10 tables... won\'t be spending no more money on this game!',

       'Don\'t get too serious about this game. If you miss the game just play,but if you hate waiting too long to get rare ingredients,prepare the dish or else. Just forget it and leave it for couple hours or maybe days....😀 That\'s simple!!',

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ,

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'it\'s just a chess game yea, but it actually looks nice for a change. most chess games are really boring because all they have are symbols and very rarely, possibly sound. when you think it\'s boring that means you don\'t like chess, but not the app. what do you expect? guns and explosions? didn\'t think so.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '- added the save function',
       '- updated difficulties of levels',
       '- added description of stalemate' ,

      'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn\'t lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it\'s better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don\'t want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.',
       'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃' ,

      'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'The game is amazing, and the ads help them make money, if you made a game this good would just want to let people play it? No, you would want a reward. The only things I don\'t like is that the land is sometimes unfair, my phone randomly mutes, and on my old phone I had this and there were more characters but not now on this phone',
       'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.' ,

Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though' ,

      'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'If you like solitaire you will hate this game. This isnt a game of skill or strategy. Its a sort of a matching game and it becomes clear quick that they are going to drain you of your seed currency quick so you can start spending real money. You will just pull card after card that you dont need.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy' ,

Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'This game is very nice and the best game I have ever played. If you have a chance to download this game dont let this chance to pass by. I prefer you to download this game. In this game you have a small place to decorate but there is more place which you have to buy. There is a guide in this game called Ernie who has the most beautiful town ever. You can visit his town any time you like and also make friends with anyone else. Me and my all sisters ( I dont have a brother )play this all day long and have much fun. This is the best game ever.',
       'This game is sooooo addictive,  it\'s like 4get cooking,  cleaning once you start it\'s hard to stop lol.  Lots of fun races,  prizes,  co-ops to help each other & make friends and have a great time.  But be forwarned this game can cause you to lose track of time.  Oh I will play for couple hours & next thing you know it\'s 1 am lol.  Hmmm few more mins bam it\'s 4 am.' ,

      'This game is wack. You can\'t reinforce your clan members. You can\'t send resources to your clan members. But after you start playing this game they start asking for your real money about 10 minutes in to it. Why would anyone spend real money to play a game after just 10 minutes? This game is no where near that good. Lol. I deleted it after 3 days. Not a game I would reinstall.',
       'C\'mon...look at what you guys had done? So many bugs after the latest update the stereo speaker was used to give free diamonds and now giving money???? What the...don\'t be so greedy like that Zero star',
       'I can\'t play and support a game where the women are unrealistic. You have the men completely covered, while the women look like they\'ve just come out of a brothel. In reality, the chances of seeing actual people like this is slim. Uninstalled for boredom and your portrayal of women.',
       'inoggedo, was kicked from my alliance. Rejoined. Logged in an hour later and I was kicked again. The entire alliance keeps getting auto kicked. My husband is our alliance leader and I know hes not kicking people. Please fix.',
       'I love the concept and that I don\'t see any bully Chinese crews YET, but time will tell. Umm, where are my diamonds for binding my account? Never received diamonds but I did get one measly stinking one hour speedup!!!',
       'Buggy, buggy, buggy! Can\'t reinforce alliance members, chat doesn\'t work, mail doesn\'t work - and no way to contact as their support doesn\'t work at all. Serious work needed as that\'s all just the start. I have bought a monthly pack and various others, safe to say I\'ll not put anymore into this at all.' ,

All in all great, thanks.',

      'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game' ,

      'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'That stupid balloon weapon has killed and ruined the game for me. Also, supply boxes have gone rubbish recently. Getting the same old rubbish which is always alot less powerful than current level. Not had a decent tank in ages. Was a good game, not anymore.' ,

      'Quite Addictive. Played nonstop 6/7 hours and unlocked 40%. what u just need is time behind it. There\'s a rule of Fibonaceae in mathematics and if u follow the rule in the game you will make it in the minimum time. But the amount making system is quite sick. U don\'t  need that critical numeric use of currency just keep it low in the gameplay. Otherwise the game is good.',
       'Gave 2 stars more than last time...  Now i have all the mines but i think that i will delete this game..... Too much frustrating because of the instability of the game.... The game always shut down either i\'m watching an ad or just upgrading my miners.... When it happens on an ad it\'s thw worst!!!! sometimesi have to redo the same boosting to 3-4 times until it works once... So instead of losing 30-45 sec of my life for a game a lose 3 minutes in all!!!!',
       'Was fun to play but I suddenly got the same issue alot of people are having. My game won\'t load past 42% on the boot up screen, was working fine last night, went to bed and hasn\'t worked since I woke up. Y\'all seriously need to figure out the problem since I have many people complain bout it',
       'I like this game a lot. There was a problem with one particular ad causing the game to have to be restarted, but they seem to have gotten rid of it.  Developer responded to my unhappiness.  Isn\'t that a good Developer? I think so.  Their game, Idle Factory Tycoon is really good also.',
       'Well although I like the game, I have to give such a low rating, due to the prices. I think the devs used the wrong currency. Otherwise it\'s hard to explain prices over 20€ for 1 chest or a boost for only a few hours. But that\'s the games we have to deal nowadays. Do nothing and pay a fortune for it.',
       'The in app purchases are a little overboard. I normally wouldn\'t pay for stuff in an app but for this game I would definitely not even consider it. Nothing should cost more than $50, but there are packages in this app costing $100... that\'s way too much and I really don\'t like it. The only thing I want to see in the game is the ability to upgrade things with a percent amount of money. (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and obviously max which already exists)' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'It\'s an interesting game of strategy.  You make allies in order for your alliance to grow. At the same time always on your guard knowing at any time your allies can instantly become enemies to prevent you on your way to becoming the strongest alliance in the kingdom. There are new quests to complete weekly. Each with different rewards that help you to achieve power.There are many kingdoms on the map which is great. The only downside is you have to leave one kingdom and join another to enter it and play the game in it. Not sure if you get to keep the same level and strength you achieved. But I\'m sure that the developers will one day have it to where kingdom will be able to attack kingdom and there\'s a lot of kingdoms. The game would definitely become very intense and even more exciting then. It would also become one of the best of the best strategic games there is.' ,

      'Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',
       'Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'If you like spending mad money to be an Internet tough guy this is the game for you.  Of you have tons of time to kill to be a punching bag for pay to play Internet tough guys it may also be the game for you.  If the computer random stuff kills off your troops don\'t expect to get tech support, it will always be reviewed in 1-3 days, even the next time you ask, another 1-3 days.',
       'Game Sucks! Super high levels can come in wipe you out, seems like if they had a level limit, let\'s say 5 levels above you they can\'t attack, but O NO!!  Every day I come in to find I have been attack by a level 25 and I\'m only a level 14. It takes days to rebuild, so yeah everyday same thing, about to uninstall this game not worth it to me...',
       'Gameplay is good, not a lot to complain about. As far as purchasing via in-app, BE CAUTIOUS AS THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OR THE QUANTITY OF THE SUPPLIES YOU PURCHASE FROM WHAT WAS ADVERTISED TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT SEE REIMBURSEMENT.' ,

      'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'This was one of my favorite games... until like many others I lost all progress with the big patch about 6 weeks ago.   Numerous tickets have been submitted over those 6 weeks with zero response, except here on Google play to help them save face.  A lot of my time and money has been robbed.  Proceed with extreme caution.',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'The game doesn\'t load!!! 1.) There\'s nothing wrong with my internet connection! I don\'t have any problems playing RIFT, LOTRO, Neverwinter, Aura Kingdom, Allods Online, etc. or any of my other Google Play apps on my internet connection! 2.) Using Task Manager doesn\'t work! 3.) My device has way more than 200 MB of free space on it! 4.) I haven\'t been able to play for 14 days now!!! 5.) Jurassic Survival looks more promising since there are no loading problems!!!! >:(',
       '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.' ,

      'Don\'t want to play hours of boring levels to get to (hopefully) more difficult stuff. I would have no issue if the levels were at least different from each other. It takes merely 10 seconds to get through the starting levels but there are just too many. It\'s wasteful.',
       'I have seen Rickimus and Mortonimers shenanigans at least a million times, so it was no suprise that I completed the game faster than it could even load. Good way to save a few brain cells though.',
       'It\'s alright, don\'t get me wrong the game is engaging for the mind, but it can get quite boring. I would recommend downloading this game because you may like it. 😶',
       'It\'s a good game, but needs more levels. Also I\'d like to not be asked every 2 minutes to rate your game 5 stars',
       'The game itself is fun, but it runs very slowly and sometimes the ads freeze the game so I have to close and reopen the game to continue. This is too tedious to make it enjoyable.',

       'I am a 76 O.A.P. & have paid £1.79 for ADS FREE, but I am still having to sit through 30 second ads. This is unlawful advertising, I have sent the Play Store an email explaining the situation with the so called ADS FREE. A neighbour of mine has also paid £1.79 but still having to watch 30 second videos, she is 75years. I have looked through the reviews & I have found numerous other people who are complaining about paying money for nothing. A few have even mentioned the word ripoff. How right they are. Still waiting to see if the Play Store replies to my email, for I sent 3 emails to the developers without reply. If they are not going to remove the ads then they should return our money, someone somewhere needs to do something about this wrong doing.',

But this game suffers with the same problem of other LEGO games: why there\'s no cloud saving? Why can\'t you use Google Play or Facebook to keep our progress? I just can\'t understand.',
       'Love this game but it would be really awesome if the theme background would change instead of always driving in the street. Perhaps have a park theme and other areas maybe a beach theme and they ride on jetskis and collect coins jumping over obstacles etc. Make it more diverse and less of the same thing. And more fun characters 😀',

      'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Money trap. They don\'t even offer the option to watch videos to recharge the fuel to be able to play. So unless you spend money on this game you\'ll be stuck and having to wait hours to be able to play again. Such a shame given the game is so much fun. I was really enjoying it until i ran out of fuel and had to either wait or spend diamonds, which are hard to come by if you don\'t buy them. Very disappointing.',
       'Should be able to start of where you get destroyed.  Not start of the beginning of the level. Also I agree with some of the reviews. There are times where there are too many rockets and roadblocks. Need to cut back a bit. Also. With all the fire power. I can\'t destroy a rocket or roadblock?',
       'Simple nice arcade game. A bit repetitve after some time, and the ads bonuses are way too high. Good game though, if you watch an ad every time you can there\'s no need for paying anything.',
       'This game is awesome! it\'s like an 90\'s style playstation game but bare in mind that it needs more cars and maybe some new power ups. Hate the road blocks lol 😂' ,

      'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'I like the game, I was a bit worried to get it when it came out at first, but after installing it and learning how it generally works I like it a lot. I would love to see more pokemon added and maybe even some PvP/ being able to challenge other people around you some day. So far it\'s been great, I\'m not really sure why so many people have been so upset about it, but it\'s definitely a 5/5 for me so far.',
       'Constantly saying GPS not found (11). She jumps to random places and takes forever to even move. Its basically useless.. I was going to get a new phone to play this thinking it would work better but even after the update it hasn\'t changed. Waste all my data trying to play. Not happy. Disappointed.',
       'I\'m an android user and also on a budget so I can\'t get the latest and greatest ever really. And every phone I\'ve ever had cannot run this stupid game. The developers really need to work with the lower quality phones to get it to be able to detect the GPS in them because it will load the character model, and the UI. Nothing else though. As soon as it starts loading it just says GPS signal not found and it can\'t ever find it  total garbage',
       'Pokemon keep disappearing from my backpack. They are in there after I catch them but disappear later.  They appear in pokedex as one\'s caught. Never had this problem before. Wasting money for balls when it doesn\'t count. Will never purchase balls again.  Rating would go up if bugs were fixed regularly.' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'this is a very well made game with excellent graphics and challenging play. It is however very money focused. The beginning levels are structured to encourage upgrades which at first are reasonable. Each later stage requires more diamonds to complete. The so called \'challenges\' are Impossible to complete without upgrading every implement so are essentially impossible for free play. Players beware!',
       'I love the way this game plays, and it plays like a dream. The grafics are wonderful, but there is just one flaw. The diamonds. You have to either play for a long time to earn more diamonds, and you can, or buy them with real money. And the game causes you to spend more diamonds than you can earn. From the atmosphere itself, to the food, and the appliances. Unless you have a lot of time and patience, or have the money to buy diamonds, this game might grind your nerves.' ,

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure.' ,

      'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'Game seems fine as long as you DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!. Game is so rigged and its about the most obvious Ive ever seen. Just before tourney time, you will not make a shot and you will be reduced to ZERO coins, balls and trophies. I have over 10,000 matches so I know the game and support very well. DO NOT BUY BALLS, COINS HEARTS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM PLAYDEMIC.',
       'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'I haven\'t been able to use the app since I updated the app a few days ago. So apparently they haven\'t worked out all the bugs.... it will load all the way to 100%, then it goes to a 2nd download screen and it only makes it to 50 %  before it stops downloading. So it was great up until that point',
       'Fun and entertaining game for sure. I wish there was more variety of courses, but I enjoy the competition in this a lot. They update frequently, and have very helpful customer service. One small change I\'d make, on shootouts, if it could show your distance from the pin next to your name or vice versa. I\'d like to see different clubs available for purchase as well.' ,

       'This game is very addictive but it just seems like an ad watching game. All the company cares about is money so they spam ads on to the game. Why play mini games for Golden Apples when you could just watch ads for Golden Apples since they let you watch infinite ads. Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.',

      'This game is AMAZING I think its  suitable for any age because its entertaining and it doesn\'t have a lot of adds which is really cool since this game is free. It also has a variation of different puzzles to keep u entertained. I think that if u r reading this right now then DOWNLOAD IT NOW.',
       'I abseloutly love this game. The controls are amazing the games are great and it is so stress relieving and I would play this in every second of my spare time. I would totally reccomend this for kids and adults!!! Go and get this free app that I am addicted to 😀😍',
       'This is a nice hodgepodge of puzzle games. They have a great selection, and I like the mental workout that I get when I play. If you\'re on the fence, download it, and at least try it out because it really is a great app. It can get quite challenging though, so be aware of that, and don\'t give up!  Update: I took away one star because I was concentrating hard on a puzzle, and an ad popped up which totally ruined my concentration. I actually stopped playing the app because I was so pissed.',
       'I\'ve only had this game for a day, but I\'ve been addicted! I\'ve played for hours and hours and it\'s a real brain twister. I\'ve done several puzzles after those hours and i found out in growing faster! This really Helps my puzzle solving skills. Thanks!',
       'This is actually quite addictive & enjoyable. Definitely distracts you & helps kill time or zone out when your brain is too busy. My daughters, (16 yrs & 5 yrs) along w my son (12 yrs) play w me, and we try to race each other thru the levels. I would give this wee game 5 stars if it weren\'t for the amount of ads & the length of time the ads play. If the ads were adjusted a wee bit it would be easier to do the side by side races. Hope y\'all 👍 it.',
       'It\'s an amazing app with great puzzles. Though there\'s so many ads and recently the app started crashing every time I try open the app and try to do a puzzle. I hope this problem is fixable without having to reinstall and start over.' ,

      'Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.',

       'Can\'t disable or lower sound in game. Seems like such a basic mechanism to be missing. Overall feels incomplete, with an unbalanced economy based on advertisements with no real progression coming from play time. Decent concept, poorly executed.',
       'All you do is watch ads. Start the game, you get an ad. Play one round (rounds last about 30 seconds), watch an ad. Play two rounds, watch an ad. Want to double your earnings from last round?

Literally half of the time spent in the game is just watching ads.',

They\'re on the screen as you play, they\'re pushed every second game and the rewards are nerfed so you gotta watch more adds if you don\'t want to grind more, something that will pop more adds sooooo...

      'This game is good for a good time waster, but eventually it gets boring. The only thing really fun is trying to beat your high score. I think a way to help improve the game is have a high score chart around the  world. So we are going against everyone and trying to beat their high score as well as our own.  You can have many charts. A weekly, monthly, daily, and overall.  And with that being said I think you should incorporate prizes. Which can just be skins for the blocks. Trying to collect all of the skins.    Just a thought and idea. Because there comes a time where it\'s gets boring competing against yourself.',
       'Love the game. I hate that there is a ad after every end. If you have to restart, you\'ll get any ad before you can continue. Outta frustrating Ann\'s makes me not want to play.',
       'The ads are so Terrible they interrupt gameplay now so if you were placing a block forget it it just placed itself because it registers that you let it go. Good game but not worth the annoyance.',
       'Really you have no idea what\'s coming next, so you can\'t plan on your next strategic move. Its all luck if you make it to the next round or not. So theres no challenge. I do appreciate the fact it has no ads.',
       'It would be better if the adverts didn\'t stop you playing the game. Also asking for the rating every five mins pisses me off',
       'It needs an undo option or needs to show two of the next set of 3...maybe even give an option to pick which set you want to play. It\'s frustratingly fun...I get mad and stop playing, but like an addict, I come back. And for those that don\'t like the ads. Turn your phone to airplane mode while playing.' ,

      'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Why is there no controller support!!!!! For a game like this it is imperative for good controls. Playing on a touch screen is alright but I would like to be able to use a controller and considering controller support has been out sense android 4.0 this wouldn\'t even limit your customer base as I doubt any 4 year old phones can even play your game above 10fps. It seems like it is deliberately being left out and it is baffling me. Please can we use our controllers it\'s such a simple api to implement!!!! Seriously I think monkeys can implement controllers in games quicker then you guys what the hell!!',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???' ,

      'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are great😁',
       'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Awesome game! Two things: please do something about the controls, they feel very poor quality. Even addig a left and a right arrow would be more comfortable for me.. Second is content. This game is huuuuge. But I\'m so addicted I managed to conquer all the islands by now, so I really want more challenges. Thanks for the awesome game, keep up the good work!' ,

      'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong, I love the game. It has a nice idea, gameplay is great, and it\'s addictive. Or, it WOULD be addictive if it didn\'t take me 3 hours to get enough chalices to play 1 level.   It\'s no fun if I have to stop, then play, then stop, then play. Before, I had a limit of 7 chalices (1 chalice every 10 minutes, I think) and each level cost 1 chalice for first play. Now I still have a limit of 7 chalices (1 chalice every 30 minutes???) And each level costs 6 chalices. 6 CHALICES!  It doesn\'t add up! Do you want me to play your game or not? I would honestly give this game 5 stars if it had reasonable timing. I don\'t like this update.',
       'Reason I changed from 5 star rating to 4 stars is before a recent update, you only needed 1 dragon chalice to play any level. Got changed to needing more than 1 on most levels, which wouldn\'t be so bad if they didn\'t make you wait 1 hour to get 1 dragon chalice back. Used to only be a 15 minute wait between chalice\'s. If it goes back to old way......5 stars again! Still a great game',
       'After reaching level 39 my camp game completely erased and I\'m back to level 2. wasted so much time making hearts. .update. I tried to play again. I even have cloud saving my game again. I reached level 30. Suddenly all my dragons are gone. Again. What the hell game! Update: once again  the updated and all my progress is gone. This time om at level 53. I\'m done. The creators don\'t even reply or show that they are listening to the players to come to a solution. I\'m not playing this game again. WASTE OF TIME!',
       'Purchased the 30 day gem subscription. Got the first few days then it stopped. No way to contact support from inside the game, help menu continually crashed. Emailed support from outside the game and received no reply. Hoping Paypal can get my money back. Cute  time wasting game but don\'t spend real money on it.',
       'Love the idea. Would love to have getting gems be a little bit easier without spending money, watch ads or something for gems, since they are required to complete some quests. Also, mine all of the sudden stopped working. Said the hardware in my phone couldn\'t support it anymore. Same phone. So, now I can also no longer play. Bit bummed about that.' ,

       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark "Xxx" and I\'ll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'Was super fun until you introduced balls achieved by watching ads and a luck based ball/challenge system. The devs got greedy and ruined this great time waster',
       'game is fun and simple but gets a bit \'samemy\'.  Maybe I have yet to progress to the surprises but just balls and hoops thus far.  Please guys add something unexpected to keep us playing',
       'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

      'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Best game of all time I mean you have to try this or else your life could be boring and lonely the 1st and 2nd are also really good check em out and you can\'t live with out this game. My point is best game ever',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day.

       'It has only 4 mini games, compared to the previous version, not the best',
       'Best Game Ever And After just adding Dippy and Pillock I finished all the characters even though before I got the update I finished collecting all characters by getting Dunce then I went to play it through app stores and update it And now I have All the characters again I love your really wonderful  games and they started off as an advert about being safe around trains my favourite song the games are my favourite games ever as well Thanks so much for brightening my day Metro.' ,

      'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any',
       'My wife and I play this game like an old couple as we wait for our son to sleep, sure enough - we all doze off!  This game makes the brain go, sometimes my brain goes so hard that smoke comes out my ears.  Beautiful. Thank you for the gift of this game, we\'ve shared about the light it brings into our lives.   That\'s a good ending.',
       'Really functional sudoku app with a great UI and some nice features. My one issue is the hint button.  I tap it way too often by accident and it permanently reveals a tile, which kind of spoils the puzzle. Otherwise it\'s great',
       'Ads were distracting, especially for the 30 second Angry Birds app, so I just bought the game to skip the ads. Only 3 bucks, I think. Gameplay helps in solving the puzzles.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '- Screen brightness issue is solved',

      'Great game Social Point!! Im addicted.. One thing tho.. Can you add a production line for the library. Its a bit sucky just making one book at a time. Having a production line like the food will help the flow if the game.. 😉 can\'t wait for the food truck to be opened up!!!',
       'I got something trouble again. I dont know this is bug or anything. But i lost my gold 15k. 2 days ago my gold 15, ... k but tomorrow 22 feb 2018 i realized that my gold became 693 gold. I didnt upgrade or buy something. I only bought wheat 10 pcs and peas 8 pcs on market and in that time i realize my gold become 693. Please fix it thanks',
       'I think over all its a good app maybe they should change the fact that you have to rank up to get more stuff but really other than that its a pretty good app i incorege who ever is reading this to download it but have in mind its a app that u need to work hard on to enjoy it 👍❤',
       'Everything is good and okay. But there\'s one bug in the game. The people just go through the wall even there\'s a door placed... If you can fix this it will be more realistic and great. I hope that the camera can be rotate too so it will be so wonderful...',
       'Where\'s most of the sounds gone and where\'s the new ingredients to do the7 challenges. What have you done to the game with the last updates. Cant have chefs without the stuff to cook with. STILL MISSING SOUNDS AND NO RESPONSE FROM THE MAKERS I FEEL RIPPED OFF AND LET DOWN.  Might be time to erase this game go to town ship game maybe they will listen and respond. Wish i could get a refund back on all the gems you have to buy to finish levels. Yes you and your game is starting to p-ss us off waiting for you.  My phone is brand new up to date don\'t try to blame our phone and it the same on my tablet which is brand new to. All the sound was there before your new update',

      'Far too many ads. And being forced to watch a 30 sec ad before continuing! Sorry, uninstalling. Try banner ads only, and I will play this game for ages. Now you won\'t make any more money out of me. Also, look at the reviews, you obviously haven\'t got a clue about what irritates people.',
       'Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there\'s a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.',
       'The game itself is good but seriously the devs are so greedy they have an ad every 15 seconds or so. If it was an ad every 5 minutes or so I\'d probably end up buying no ads and maybe even spending more on microtransactions, but I won\'t support this game or company when they are so blinded by greed they don\'t realise they\'ll have many more consistant players watching more overall ads with just a longer delay in between...',
       'Invasive ads, after most actions. Skippable after 5-10 seconds, but come way too often for this type of game. Games cool, but I uninstalled it after my tenth ad in about ten minutes',
       'The amount of ads this game throws at you every few seconds is just unacceptable. Too many ads! Seriously, every 10-15 seconds a video ad plays when you tap anything. The game would actually be fun but the ads completely ruin it.',
       '1 star for this AD Simulator. I understand you guys need to earn some money, but putting too much ads in your app which is good ruins everything. Consider reducing number of ads. I\'m uninstalling game until this gets resolved.' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'It\'s been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there\'s no rhythm at all. Why don\'t you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it\'s only getting worse..',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '1. shield\\sprint\\deceleration\\challenge key\\rejuvenation treasure chest are added;',
       '2. Lucky turntable is added;',
       '3. Classic songs are put into grade list. Challenge for free;',
       '4. Level up to 120 for more songs!' ,

       'I am really surprised. The amount of new mazes I\'ve never seen before just blows me away. Of course you can just play the classic version thats why I downloaded it but wow love this game. And you don\'t have to spend money unless you want to its very kick back. Adds of course but whats a dollar to you?',

       'i love the game of pacman since i was four on 2012 but i couldnt find one on play store since 2013 but i saw this thx bandai and for gundam',
       'Great. Just like the arcade game, from the 80s!   One caveat: I purchased the \'No Ads Forever\' option, as an in-app purchase, but I was still getting ads, even after restarting the app.  I ended up contacting their customer service department, in order to effectively get the ads removed.  Also, you can use it with a gamepad, which really makes it that much more enjoyable.' ,

      'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I\'m from Michigan,we\'re both married ,but there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜',
       'This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven\'t experienced anything toxic, yet. I\'ve been playing for about a week and it\'s really great' ,

The concept of the game is simple - you’ve got a box of gems, and your only objective is to match and merge them to make them as splendid as possible. Every so often, you’ll be gifted a new gem - and the faster you tap on box at the bottom of the screen, the faster the gems will appear. Each gem that appears on the board can be merged with other gems of the same kind to form a greater gem - the bigger, the shinier the gem, the more currency you will earn. And the more currency you earn, the more gems you can purchase in the game store! Use your winnings to discover all sorts of new gems, and expand into new areas. All you have to do is make your gem collection the best it can be. The bar at the top of the screen measures the quality of your collection - merge gems to earn XP and level up. Higher levels will unlock more space to grow your collection - the more space you have, the more impressive your collection can become. Once you move into new areas, make sure to keep an eye on all of your collections, ensuring that you’re merging and growing them to their full potential. Merge, grow, and sparkle with Merge Gems!',

      'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'O.k. the game has been fun. Love decorating. My gripe is why can\'t I keep the furniture that I have purchased with my own money? And why do I have to repurchase items that I have already bought? And why am I limited on purchasing if I spend my own money.  You guys say that you don\'t enhance the voting process but I tend to differ. Many times rooms that have scored A 5 are all in the same color tones and almost look the same. It has been fun but unless you give me more options to purchase I\'m? out.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'I really love this game! It surely brings out my passion in interior designing, nourish my mind as i see others works, getting inspired also to continue want i really love in life, which is designing/art. And it does help me to chill or relax whenever im depressed bcoz it makes me think what to design, and helps me get out of the stress that life brings. It indeed help me with my mental and emotional instability. 5 stars for this! Number 1 app for me. Never failed my expectations. LOVE IT!' ,

      'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'Definitely a fun short game. No real incentives to keep on playing though. The eye candy is not good enough and the music is repetitive.  Needs something more than the simple leveling system and the music either needs to be in beat with the obstacles or have more variety.',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'This is the most addictive game i have ever played. I always play it when am bored and you can play it when your offline. Totally recommend it but pls answer this question..what is the world highest score?' ,

      'After months of playing this game I realised  no need to keep gems but to spend them snd rewards are amazing when you got gifts for fulfilling the tasks. So slow pacing. Could have been more exciting but I like this game and I belong to a township that\'s competitive and kind. Awesome game!',
       'I\'m facing a problem. Their is a costumer that wants a statue that costs me 650 diamond and I don\'t have that much of diamonds I only have 5. And he asked it from me like more than 2 weeks ago . So please give me the diamonds. But its a very wonderful game and I like it so much. But please help...',

       'When is the next update on the game and how much longer do we have to wait for Bill and Mary to say I do ? It\'s killing me to wait this long ? Oh I am also wondering why haven\'t I got to go on a higher level I have been on level 28 for the longest time so fix the problems now',
       'Great game. Enjoy the different story lines. What happened to the wedding storyline for Bill & Mary? Every time Diego leaves something goes wrong. My township has disappeared.  I had deposited money & spices in the treasury...what\'s joining on.',
       'Moves pretty slow and very repetitive. Also takes forever to open on my phone since the update. I think you should get more spices for the diamond cost as well.' ,

      'This game is fun and entertaining and time will pass by you playing this. The only downfall is you only get so many chests locations on main screen and take hrs to open them up. So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by. Wind totally inconsistent, almost like it screws you purposely.  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs and it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.',
       'It\'s a great game but I was up against one person and it usually gives the other person a chance to hit but this time I would have won but it didn\'t give me a chance to go another round. Don\'t know if this is a glitch or part of the game but it irritated me',
       'It has a few bugs of late, Ive cleared the 2nd courses twice already but still it says 46/50 so my progress doesnt always sync well since the last update but its still the best MINI GOLF game you will find on here! It is a mini version of Golf Clash except for the set up of the controls but they are great too which is the best regular golf game I\'ve found on here...',
       'Games rotten everytime i go to play the big money games it says iv lost connection. iv got the best wifi on the market so nah dont think so. very annoying dont instal',
       'I got hit with the rocket and both times they hit my ball and their ball went straight into the hole. I\'ve gotten it 3 times and each time, it bounced me backwards and always put their ball in the best position. I\'ve lost over 6,000 coins for just those instances. Why is it when they get it, it always works out? And when I get it, it messes me up?' ,

      'Well I like the game. It\'s fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don\'t open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don\'t disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...',
       'Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don\'t really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊' ,

      'Fun game over all. Only input i have so far is problem getting sub parts/resources to the right spots. Would be nice if there was a way to have dedicated supply routes (these parts only go to this table), or the carriers could be better at balancing where they put supplies (put less where there is a surplus).',

      'A really fun, simple game! Allows you to build up your roster of heroes or compete in PvP matches. Also has a global chat and the ability to form alliances for access to more powerful characters and items.',
       'Fun game that\'s easy to learn. Only issue is that while you CAN get everything for free in the game, it is nearly impossible to have a full legendary team without buying gems.',
       'You are held hostage by ridiculously long wait times, impossibly rare items, every update is worse and only those that spend a fortune in micro transactions to gamble for characters can ever expect to have a decent account.',
       'Great game but some needed progression items are extremely difficult to locate and some battles are obviously rigged for spending to continue to play.',
       'And for those who\'d like to understand more of this type of game, why couldn\'t things be explained a bit more? You never know unless you\'re in an alliance. And can\'t do that until you\'ve reached a certain XP level. AND in tutorial mode. It\'s just brief and limited on a small scale. Also, while gaining more heroes, sometimes they\'re cloned heroes, and so you\'re stuck with them. No variety, or way to at least either trade them, or anything. I\'ve never gotten any hero past 2 * except one. And I\'m afraid I\'m not going to spend outrageous amount of $ just to Hope by chance, I get a better strength HERO etc. . If things are changed up a bit, maybe I\'ll go up in star ratings. I do love the people who are and have been real helpful. An Alliance with great helpful and strong support, those who help you progress is the best part of this game. The kind of hero\'s I\'ve been getting in summon gate are too pathetic to even bother with a token! Do not like being forced to pay for things like this, which ends up removing any possible hope for having fun because it then becomes an investment with not many perks. Smh.',

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I\'ve had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5',
       'Love this app! I prefer the original version over the walls, hex, etc. and have solved every single one of them. Need more puzzles. Although I\'m sure I can solve them all again as it\'s impossible to remember these. Either way, I cannot get enough of them.' ,

      'Earn.Unlimited👇 łnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enter (DARA) to Start Earnings So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. Uno points equals uno instead of like some of the others where it takes uno points to reach uc etc....Also, TOYOCASH App is very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyo. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'This app would score a lot better if there was an option to get rid of the adds. If gladly pay to have them gone but that isn\'t an option for some reason. They\'re so intrusive and far too frequent even for a free game. Uninstalling and won\'t be coming back' ,

      'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game',
       'Temple run 2 is a good game I like it to a lot could be better as always seem to have trouble with play services an so some features won\'t load e.g maps or have trouble getting the characters to slide windows for the selection takes a few attempts of start up. I think when it works it\'s a great game there is just know way to get the bugs out iv tried everything. G8UM8' ,

      'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve.

      'My ONLY issue is we have a Pirate, Wizard, & knight "hat", but NO clothes to go with it. Can we PLEASE get those outfits made available?? I\'ve been playing for over 10 YEARS now (I believe) & it\'s been like this since DAY ONE. Also, I\'d LOVE more furniture options. It would be cool if we had a new set for each room for every 100 levels reached. 100, 200, 300, etc bc it\'d keep players having a goal to attain & it\'d make us thrive to achieve it!!! Besides keeping us interested, we LOVE a strong variety & set of options. It rewards us, if we have the ability to purchase it, & we play for reward. Just a thought that I hope you STRONGLY consider & follow through with.  I\'d give 5 stars across the board if these changes were made. THANK YOU!!!',
       'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'Not good for little ones. Too many buttons leading ads or in app purchases. Might be good for kids 6+ who would know a little better but my 3 year old just clicks everything shiny which of course is ads or in app purchases',
       'Changed my rating from 5 stars to one star because of the incessant ads. I sat through 2 30 second ads which I didn\'t click on. These ads last longer than the actual game time. I\'m not paying to get rid of the ads, nor should I have to sit through them without requesting them..',
       'I think this game is very very fun and addictive! Dont believe people who say talking animal games have people in their eyes, (except maybe Angela) Keep up the good work!',
       'Don\'t get me wrong good game, but most of the adds freeze up the game. Plus it has caused pop ups on my phone. Fix that and i will fix my rating' ,

      'As I sat down on a bench with my drink I realised something. My bepsi didn\'t taste like bepsi. It was...CONK!? I succ on my thumb just thinking about this memory. I was ANGERY. I wanted to go back in time and tell myself "boi. That\'s CONK! Not bepsi!" And then succ all of the conk bottles up so nobody has to deal with it.',
       'It\'s awesome very addictive, my game likes to freeze or glitch sometimes and I crash or die but it\'s a free game so not overly concerned about it. Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe',
       'It\'s a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.',
       'The game is cool but there\'s a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won\'t let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit',
       'I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it\'s like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn\'t die like the heck' ,

      'Very addictive. I love how there is no building time. It\'s one of those games that I personally find myself on nonstop. I\'m very excited to see how creative they are in terms of creating new cards. Also, please add a form of convoy that travels on the water, and maybe even add dark troops only found in dark chests. Just some ideas. Keep up the great work!',
       'Awesome Game!!! I have played a lot of strategic games where we have to attack to get resources but here it is totally different...opposite of coc, boom beach e.t.c... And the interesting thing is upgrading anything does not take time... Loved this game... Appreciate it guys😁😁',
       'This is about as perfect a game I\'ve seen in a very long time.  There isn\'t an overwhelming feeling of developer greed here with ads constantly interrupting the game experience.  The game is polished, smooth, and not too hard on the battery.  I\'ve always wondered what a PVP TD would be like, and it\'s awesome!  This is definitely a developer to watch!',
       'Game is not loading. Installed it agreed to everything still game wouldn\'t load and get stuck at 30% and then show can\'t connect to server. My net is fine and decent speed.  Still I would like to know why do you need to see my emails ? What do you want out of my emails ? Get out of emails.',
       'I really like the game and the gameplay but I hope you\'ll take my suggestion. I hope that we could earn gokd by also attacking other players and not just cargoes. It seemed pointless sometimes if we cant do so. Or perhaps sell some of the cargoes that we looted from other players in xchange for gold. But all in all it\'s a decent game',
       'It\'s highly entertaining! Not very much down time, no stupid energy bars, you can spend money if u want 2, but don\'t. All in all this is a cool little game! Thanks devs.' ,

      'Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can\'t figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy',
       'Ads, ads, and more annoying Ada that can only be removed by using "coin". While I have no issue paying for apps or occasional chunks of content, this was annoying AF. I also didn\'t find it particularly challenging.',

      'Great game. First turn based strategy game that I have enjoyed in a long time. There is no dumb energy bar that you have to wait to refill which is amazing.  Also there are no ads unless you voluntarily watch one to get a bonus to a chest. The only thing I wish was different is that the player could unlock multiple chest at once. It\'s quite slow to open chests as it is and it would be awesome to be able to unlock more chests at the same time. Overall it\'s a great game with a bright future. I would definitely recommend getting it.',
       'Just downloaded. Like what I see so far and can play casually. No ads interfering with game play. Hope to see some strategic maps in the future. I\'ll change my review once I get to know the game better. This is definitely NOT one of those ridiculous grindfest mobile games. There\'s gaming consoles and PC\'s for that nonsense.',
       'Great turn based strategy game. I love the graphics and the in-depth strategy. Matches are quick, controls are fairly simple, and there is a huge amount of card variety. I have yet to encounter any trolls either, and I\'ve been playing since launch.',
       'I just installed your f game and i give you this rewiew. I dont know how much you pay for your adds but your game sucks!!!',
       'The concept is great, and I love the idea you put into it. Id continue playing more if there were a few tweaks done. It took 5 minutes (literally) to match up to someone who didn\'t fight (not a *bot* we get to fight in the beginning) as well as take a minute each to unlock a 15s chest...  Otherwise its nice!',

      'I like the game but there is a bug in it.. i have 420 diamonds and i went to the store and there was a button to get 45 more and watch the video so i did and nothing happens. Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls.

Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',

If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. 😊',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.',
       'it\'s a good game and challenging. Strategy is needed on going through battles, Arranging your defenses is very tough to manage lol..... You want to keep away the enemies from your lawn though........ and I love the "Builder hall" when I\'m done on my "Town hall" I manage the second camp.... although the loot in Builder hall is limited it\'s fun and addictive a real time killer........ keep up the good work developers........ have a good day.... ^_¤',
       '1. Make us know how many players are online and who are the players online                    2.

Add more plants or obstacle for extra gems  4.Add more clan banners of flags which can help ofcourse many clans or make your own clan banners or flags. ofcourse when making own it needs to be payed with gems                                 That would be all pls let me know if you agree pls reply I would Appreciate if You,SUPERCELL Agree or not.

      'Pretty cool! I hate that there is not enough reward to play more.. at least victory chests should be always available or an option to erase a chest so you can use the slot to win a more powerful chest. Idea of the game is good, but for the player becomes more frustrating than enjoyable. You wait for all cards to load then you can\'t use them, only one.. the rest need another reloading.. crappy gameplay.',
       'Don\'t bother playing unless you\'re made of money.  If you play without paying a lot of money you will lose a lot and never win a tournament.  The lag is terrible which also causes you to lose a lot. When you decide to pay for some gems watch out cause they will charge up to 4x the amount, then you get to go through the process of emailing idiots and taking days to get your money back. Plus they don\'t match you to your equal the person could be the champ and you\'ll never win against someone that has played it years longer than you. Well best of luck to those that this review didn\'t scare off.',
       'If u don\'t spend money you will never be a big winner! Everytime a new card comes out everyone buys them up and you can\'t win. That makes this beautiful fun game suck turds!!!!',
       'It\'s a fun game, but don\'t waste you\'re money. If you\'re going to charge $25 for a chest at least give someone a legendary character. Waste of cash, never again!.',
       'Been playing for a year now,very addictive. But its very unreasonable .. ive spend more tha  R1500 on the game and im on 2400 trophies for 5months. They put you against players that\'s much stronger then you..',
       'Can i have 5 minutes alone in s locked room with the current algorithm designer, plz?!?The  Best ANTI - PLAYER GAME Ever!😆1 yr + of play= GUARENTEES/  No PROGRESSION,  To be robbed,  To be cheated, To be underleveled,  To be overmatched, To be lied to!

      'I just bought the level 4 crates. Some were delivered, then it reverted to level 3. I have a screen shot showing that I already had level 4. I cannot find a bug report feature in this game. Please fix this in my account. Otherwise, I love the game. Remember to buy something to fix the ads.  Edit: I sent customer support an email with a screen shot a month ago. There has been no response.',
       'Stay away unless you plan on paying money.  The devs force ads in almost everything you do, and I\'m pretty sure they aren\'t vetted as one of them seemed to take control of my screen. Great potential way to serve up malware to your customers.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',

      'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'Plays good at first then only gives u balls u dont need like 15 yello balls in a row or how i keep loosing cuz ill ame somewere and it firest were ever it wants or when u click on the chest it fires the ball or how if someone txts u the game has to restart no matter were u are. During the restart u must close 5 adds to play the game agian',
       'I like it other then the fact of every time I got to shoot the ball goes slightly left or right not exactly where I want it. Might be my screen sensitivity?  Other then that I dig it!',
       'It\'s the best! But there are a bit too many ads, but the thing I like about the ads that they are shorter than most ads.' ,

Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I\'ve literally been zeroed out because the app won\'t let me log in... multiple times. It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.',
       'Was never able to connect to even set up an account to try the game. Messages to support only returned with irrelevant form letters. Tried my Wi-Fi, data, and Wi-Fi at Att store. No luck and can\'t get an actual human to respond just a form letter telling me to uninstall, reinstall, use different Wi-Fi or get a different phone. All to try their game. LOL If that\'s the support you get when you are a perspective customer, imagine the "help" if they already have you hooked on their game. STAY AWAY!  (Galaxy S-7 Active Phone)' ,

      'Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay 😊',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'The gameplay is unique, but one thing I notice that is so hard to get the highest level as we totaly have no idea about the beat from music while we play it. Need to play the same level on and on until I become familiar with every single beat from it. Anyway, use your best headphone. They come with so much beautiful musics you\'ll ever heard',
       'Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.' ,

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'One of the worse cash grabs I have ever seen.  Love the game, but you literally need hundreds of dollars to do any single event and get a decent reward.  Go look at the latest event on their Facebook page.  The reviews are awful, ands it veteran and new players alike.  Game is fun, but they need to cut costs by half to make it worth while.' ,

       'Its so super expensive to buy a fucshia tiara, please when i unlock it please reccomend 1999 coins again and my pou so super preety pink and so beautiful. Update: please when i unlock it it must be 999 coins per item and please make it cheaper and please make it more beautiful like adding sparkles in tiaras and make more minigames and specials!                                   Problem: i can\'t raise enough money and food and please make the tiara cheaper so i can save lots of money.

       'It\'s been more than a year that you haven\'t added any mini game in any update. You\'ve written on "What\'s New" section that "We\'re working on something big" but you .haven\'t shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I\'ll rate 5.',
       'I played Pou once before. But now I will go back on taking care of him. The things I remember are, The mini games, Pou is becoming fat and a lot of things that I can\'t remember. I\'ll play this now for good :D... BTW, awesome game!',
       'I wish you didn\'t have to wait for a long time for a item. Like, for example, if a hat was level 60. Then you have to wait for a long time. Please instead of doing levels. Please just make them expensive. Because you need to wait.',
       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.' ,

      'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'It was a great game. Until you guys updated it. It\'s now extremely laggy. It causes there\'s if my phone to lag. I personally don\'t like the newly revamped maps. Im really good at this game, but I\'m on a six game losing streak due to lag. Please fix . Thanks',
       'Great game honestly you guys are doing a great job but some things need to be fixed. 1. Way to much lag of all kinds. Needs to be fixed that should be your first priority.2.the update to the brewery map was awesome but not what we wanted.there are are lots of places that look like you can get to but can\'t. (ie the fire escape stairs and more). 3. Get rid of the SG557, it\'s over powered and it isn\'t fun when other people are using it so either balance it out or get rid of it completely.(M14 could be tweaked a little to). 4. Graphics are okay but could be much better. Other than that it\'s a great game that you should download if you want to play an for game on your phone. Thanks!',
       'VERY *ADDICTIVE*!!!! The only reason i would tell you not to get the game is because YOU WILL PLAY THIS GAME 24/7! 😂 GREAT GAME but 1 complaint, please could you make a seperate brewery which was the old one because myself and EVERYONE I ask like the original. Please take this into account and keep up the good work 😀',
       'So...I have Bug that i think its only on my phone that every so often my phone freeze for half-min. i would love if u guys could do some work on that if other are having the same problem like me...',
       'this was the best game before the update... but now its the worst evr game i hv played... lags a lot. Now i hate this game.. hope u get a new update resolving these probs.' ,

      'Most of the controls are excellent, I love the snap-to by selecting a ball, and the fine tune dial, however the "spin" mechanic is terrible to the point of being broken. No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'Was disappointed when I reached level 816 and found no more game. Also, game could use some kind of "side game" to avoid boredom.  But still good time killer.',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.',
       '1st there are ads in between each play which is ridiculous.. I dont know how high the game goes up but there are NO hints or instructions on what exactly the goal is besides potting balls.. it\'s ADDICTIVE and fun BUT if this is all there is to it I won\'t keep game long' ,

       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',

      'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don\'t lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless. Plus it\'s just an incredibly addictive game that you can do well with even if you don\'t spend any money.',
       'I\'ve been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.',
       'OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don\'t get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits',
       'Very unfair. D\'ont download it unless you want to spend a fortune. After four years of playing, the new op heroes available for cash, will crash your in a second. Be aware !!!' ,

      'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play 😄',
       'This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That\'s why I rated this game 5 stars.',
       'Don\'t restrict players by taking away added ability from weapons, gear, and wear in siege mode. The game should be a lot more flexible with the payouts... players not winning anything worth the time wasted playing a game that wants you to buy items that don\'t bring anything for the purchase. Like, reward players with trophies for purchases. Or create a new league for players that have accumulated enough points strictly for the new league. With more unlockable items and arenas...',
       'This game sucks becuz the update and u need alot off gem and coins and the update is sucks very much I can\'t even use the anti hero rifli and I need alot of gems to upgrade your game sucks no body like your game if u fix this update and u need to be batter game I think Minecraft are batter becuz Minecraft had mods and I comment in Twitter you won\'t chat back and fix I got cheat detected without any reason I don had alot of gems and coins and I had 1,678 coins and 356 gems and I just keep it then cheat detected. And now I want to hack becuz of you and I hate your app',
       'The reason why I gave 3 stars is beacause i want the renting to be more than just 2 matches maybe like 4 so they know how to use it. And when i was making my skin like some kind of bug showed up. And the bug reseted my hard work' ,

      'It\'s a great game, you can have fun while also learning a lot of interesting facts about the world. You actually can play without paying, you can watch ads to get tickets for example, I have 200 tickets even tho I haven\'t paid a cent. The only thing that I don\'t get is the new content community, it would\'ve been great if we\'d gotten some clarification on that, but oh well.',
       'I was super enjoying this game. It\'s interesting and you definitely feel like you\'re learning. The trivia is great and the format really works but for some reason I\'ve just lost like 20 of the brown tickets which I was saving. That\'s annoying and the kind of thing I delete games for unfortunately.',
       'I\'m So Sad! Once you get into the game and Really Like it! They trap you... You have to purchase "money" to travel to different cities. Not good. I\'m uninstalling. ☹️',
       'I love the game lots of fun! The only thing is it keeps freezing up on me on some of the questions. I then have to restart it and I get penalized as if I didn\'t know that block of questions. Other than that it is a really fun game and I am enjoying it.',
       'Loved thus game until the upgrade. Now it freezes, tells me I am offline. I have to reboot and lose progress and tickets. How can I go back to the old version?',
       'The game won\'t let me start the first step. It basically freezes. The music plays but after hitting the first question mark like it directs you to do nothing happens but a few more of those question marks pop up but I can\'t select them or move around the screen.' ,

      'The PvP system is super broken. One game might be played with someone at close to your rank and next you might be playing a player with 20,000+ more trophies than you. And along with that the 2 players aren\'t even getting the same waves of enemies to start with so someone with 8 less rank ups than you can beat you by 35,000+ points. This has only happened to me like 15 times a day so please fix it cause game ain\'t worth playing if PvP is broken.',
       'Bland, generic microtransaction-laden mobile version of a good game type. Levels are short and provide very little challenge until the difficulty spikes. Upgrades demand grinding or spending money. It\'s just more of the same trash flooding the mobile market.',
       'Great graphics and controls. Really unbalanced on PvP. So won\'t be bothering with that aspect of the game. Prices on gems is a bit of a rip off. Don\'t get much gems for the $. Will be avoiding that aspect of the game as well. Overall a solid 3 stars. Is fun, but could be so much better!',
       'The game was cool up until you start getting stuck and can\'t level up so the only way to move up you have to spend money to buy coins and hearts. Unfortunately people need to chase money rather than make something cool',
       'Kind of a bummer that the PvP has been under maintenance for soooooo long now.  Once you complete all the missions, the fun thing is getting new ships.  Can\'t get the newest ship without access to PvP.',
       'PVP Only mode.  Taking too long bringing the aliens out to destroy.  Can\'t even get pass the rookie stage.  Very disappointing.  But you not going to do nothing about it.  It is what it is.' ,

      'Very much a top game, graphics are in your face with colours and speed. It\'s a" please don\'t stop playing me mi kind of game" Thank you. 😱 Wicked game. Top buzz. For some unknown reason, the creatures aren\'t rolling. Still good. One of the most enjoyable games you can play with 1 finger. Thanks again. Not working is the bonuses you get playing everyday. Brilliant wicked. Excellent. Top one digit game. 👆 Great. Can\'t stop playing the game. Bravo. Thanks again. Wicked. Great. Funtastic. Brilliant',
       'No Wi-Fi needed.   Keeps getting better. Can unlock more characters as you play. Free to play style which mean you buy what you want. Looks like the game is always being worked on. Which in my opinion more new stuff or improvements to come later on ; as the game gets older and people keep playing. Which has been proven in more then one occasion.',
       'It\'s a good game to kill time with, though it doesn\'t offer much. Touch controls work well although a bit finicky, and it hits the difficulty spike a bit sooner than expected. It might have you buying some upgrades through micro transactions. I\'ve also experienced some lag that caused some unfair moments to happen. Still, it won\'t stop you from trying to beat your or your friends\' high score every once in a while. Overall, it\'s fast paced fun (Pun intended).',
       '5 stars its so good! I think its perfecto and I want you to play the game because it is so important to video games video games would not have made it this far without sonic dash and I like the paacman event right now',
       'This game is a really good game. And I think this game deserve\'s a 10/10 rating. And pacman in Sonic Dash and sonic in PAC-MAN is a really cool thing',
       'Like the game. Fun and good time waster. Wish that you didn\'t need as many Red rings to buy characters and that you didn\'t need the pay money to get Classic Sonic.' ,

All I want it to play occasionally with my friends, and if they take a day to play me back then that\'s fine by me. Either give me an option to switch it back to 2 days and get 5 stars, or keep the one star and lose a player.',
       'In general, this IS a rather fun trivia game!  The "3" rating may be a bit harsh, but it\'s to make a point.  Two problems: the question quality varies considerably, and question approval seems biased. It amazes me how some questions make it thru.  There needs to be a standard review team!!' ,

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'Hi,there my players name is cammanderDJR and I won death match like 3 times even though my level is 9 and I have no experience in survival games but this is like the best game I\'ve ever played. I still have a few idea\'s on how to make it better and that\'s the graphics please improve it. Love the game way better than Rules of Survival.',
       'The game itself is awesome, the gameplay is awesome. However I\'d suggest to make the following changes to make the game better. First I\'d add an event each week which would allow players to play different matches like training with bots or zombie apocalypse and many more. I know his might be hard but I\'m also recording free fire  for my YouTube channel ( Natan Prokop ) and trying hard with it. So it would be nice if you also added ladders and so you could climb to like buildings and towers. I\'d  also add revolvers, at least one type. Please sub to my channel and if you could add the things above that\'d be great',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'I\'ve been facing a new issue. I always used to get a ping of around 140 - 180 ms with my Jio until day before yesterday. But, since then, I\'m always getting a ping of 300+ ms. This is really annoying. Close combats are pretty impossible. I\'ve checked everything. My network is fine. I get a better ping in other online games which I play. My friends have been facing this issue as well. So, it has become harder to play squad and duo matches as well. Please do something about this Garena. I would definitely drop a 5 star then.',
       'This game is so good! I love it but could you add some binding account so account will not be loss. Im in a high level almost level 37 and I accidentally delete the app then when I download the game again I cant play my old account! That\'s horrible try to fix it admin or whoever. And last thing try to put some servers country by country so we could play against other countries. Try to do this admin. I assure you that after you made this comments or suggestions this game will be the best ever!' ,

      'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'I agree with other comments the ads are awful I\'ve tried several of these type games and all are to much ads .. But this one i seem to have higher scores than with the other ones.. It\'s a great pass time and over all a better choice',
       'I grew up with all I had to do so day long was teach myself how to play Solitaire.  It\'s not like I didn\'t have friends but was bored with the ones I had to play with.  I think the game is very realistic.  And completely challenging.',
       'I\'d really give it a 4.5 - plays smoothly and easily, ads are expected in a free game and these are easily disposed of.  The only downside for me is the "wins" are too frequent - not realistic.',
       'I need to take a break from ghastly stuff on the news. I am old and decrepit and it is all way beyond me. May I thank you all xxxxxx',
       'Lots of hints for beginners. Adverts are a little distracting coz sometimes i cant work out how to close them' ,

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you\'ve made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for making this!!! I already installed it and I can\'t wait to play it!! Thank you so much TRG! (Turbo Rocket Games) 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 oh an one thing.. when your wolf is pregnant could everything be a lot slower & a lot weaker please? That\'d be great Thanks! 😃 Oh, yeah also for the new game seasons, I\'m thinking.. Autumn & Summer! And I like how you can randomize the name! And for dog sim, I\'m thinking.. maybe Samoyed Husky & maybe Chihuahua! 😀😀😀😀' ,

      'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.',
       'I really like this game it is very fun. The only thing is, how do you wave, I dont know but I play it on PC so I am not very sure how to wave so please tell me if you can do it on PC. Also can you maybe update is so you can use it on PC with w a s d because I am used to it. Anyway love the game good job!' ,

      'Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',
       'Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up 🤘🏼',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.',
       'I hate this game because it literally makes you watch ads every single time you finish, and doesn\'t reward you for it like some apps do. I would not recommend this at all, especially because when you close the app to try to skip the add, you open it back up and it says it\'s stopped running and closes itself again because you didn\'t want to watch the stupid advertisement. If I could give it 0 stars, I would!!' ,

      'Using galaxy note 8 and the graphics are all skewed. I keep getting docked lives and having to restart  a level because the circle of off to the side of where the difference is. What\'s the point? It would be awesome if I could actually play it.',
       'The idea of the app is very nice, however, I am disappointed in the fact that the app requests to access my calls, contacts, and other data. I fail to see why is that necessary for a simple game like this. Moreover, when I listen to music and play the game, the ads come interrupting my music with their own. When I mute them and press X, the music on my phone stops completely, forcing me to leave the game and start the music again. Again, this is inconvenient for an app which I expected to be very simple.',
       'It seems that the touch is way off on my Galaxy S8, when i touch the differences i get a X, but get O for random spots mid-screen! This would be a great game if i could actually play it!!!',
       'This apps cool but being new to Samsung being a former apple person. I\'m not understanding why the games want to access your private things..calls pics etc?',
       'Sometimes it\'s like it didn\'t detect the correct difference.  You have to hit it twice, so you lose a life when you shouldn\'t.  Might be phone screen sensitivity, but it does impact playing.',
       'Fun game to use your brain. I really like that you don\'t have to buy hints!  Don\'t really like the background music, but that\'s nothing major.' ,

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',

       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.' ,

      'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',
       'There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn\'t there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.',
       'I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I\'m very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn\'t get my prize and I\'m really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I\'m expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.',
       'Great game however, there\'s this one very strange bug the comes up every so often. The bottom part of my screen doesn\'t work on the game so it\'s hard to swipe in game/ click on chests. I know it\'s not my devices fault because it works fine on everything else. Anybody else have same bug?',
       'Uncanny how the opponent in shooting race goes for the same target as me more often than not and is generally quicker. Seems similarly biased in free kick mode. It\'s almost as if you aren\'t allowed to progress unless you spend a load of money.',
       'Used to be able to control the speed of the kick. Now no mater how fast or low I swipe it\'s either super fast or super slow. And it seems to be at random. I swipe the exact same speed yet the first time it\'s 200km/h and the second time it\'s 50km/h. Getting frustrating as it used to work so well. Can\'t remember the last time it just went in the middle.' ,

      'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?',
       'Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.',
       'Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don\'t track. At least my checkpoints save.' ,

      'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I don\'t know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I\'ll say that. I didn\'t need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I\'m out.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'Game is good when the app opens, which is not often. Don\'t bother messaging support with any issues. They are useless and just just repeat the same solutions to problems you aren\'t even experiencing. Serious dissapointment. Be prepared to loose lots of coins!' ,

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..',
       'Latest update caused the game to hang on the \'starting...\' screen. I had to re-install the game. Luckily my save had synced (this time). (Playing on Samsung Galaxy S7 edge). Besides that problem, I love this game! It\'s one of the best \'freemium\' games about. The amount of content that is free is consistantly awesome and expands all the time. I also love that, unlike other freemium games, not making purchases has no major detriment to the playability. Keep up the good work EA!' ,

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'It WAS good, I spent 5 dollars and   so many hours on this game. In the new update what do I see? IT\'S ALL GONE every vehicle, head, and map, GONE! Was an amazing game after this I\'m done for a long time.',
       'New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game',
       'I have a problem. It won\'t let me  replay what I did its bad I want it fixed. Can you help?' ,

      'Overall a great game, there\'s one feature though that I feel lets this game down. Just the small fact that a father can copulate with his daughter, then again with their inbred child if you so wish. I currently have 4 generations of inbred mutants running my castle, if anything the extra fingers actually help with certain tasks such as cleaning. Do you happen to have a designer working on this with the surname Fritzl?',
       'I think the gameplay is good and the caatle building aspect is fun.  However, the level scaling is way off.  You get a point between throne room 4 and 5 and can\'t do a whole lot.  Losing fights when your characters are maxed out in training.  Other than that its pretty solid.',
       'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.',
       'Seriously, what gives with the battle system? If you can\'t beat someone 75k below your power rank because they have no real life and spend 20 hrs a day grinding for equipment - what\'s the point? Ofc I could buy that equipment with real money but would I support another pay2win crapp? Uninstalling.' ,

I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',

      'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'Guys. Love the game. Play it all the time. However...  When the update was done a week or two ago it is now locking up and shutting down. Not sure what you did but its annoying to get to level 29 of 30 and not be able to finish. For a while I would back out and just restart and it was ok. Now it just locks right back up after restarting.',
       'I love this game hence the 5 star. But the multiplayer needs some work, if I wanna play a game with a friend in 1 sitting I have to reload the map each turn. If the turns could progress without reloading the game that would be awesome. Also, I had a bug that made me replay a turn a few times in multiplayer for some reason after I returned to the game.',
       'The game is awesome. The multiplayer portion just got added, and it is very buggy. I tried it on three games already, and there are many instances where i did not get my stars during the game. I\'ve supported the game and have every tribe except the Luxidoor, and I\'m very excited with the new multiplayer gamemode. Midjiwan, pls solve it ASAP!' ,

      'Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it\'s a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz',
       'Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game',
       'Great game that I would really enjoy putting some time in but it constantly starts to shutter and the frame rate slow way down and makes it impossible to hit your marks. I had a subscription but decided to cancel it because the game is unplayable. Please fix and Its a 5 star game and worth the subscription. (Galaxy Note8)',
       'Cool little game with very few ads. The only downside is you have to buy gold to upgrade your bicycles so if you don\'t pay to win that\'s just a great time killer.',
       'Good game and concept overall. The problem is it gets to a point you are forced to buy gold to upgrade your bike. You can earn all the cash you want but cannot use it to exchange for gold. For the simple fact I have to pay out of pocket to advance at all in the game I give it 2 stars.',
       'I really do enjoy this game as an ex bmxer it\'s really exciting to play I wish there was more of a practice mode so you can get more accustomed to tracks before you race against players that are better than you otherwise and all-around good game still figuring out everything' ,

      'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx',
       'I\'m VERY unhappy!! I downloaded the update and the game informed me there was a problem with the download. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the game and ALL my progress was lost. Its back to the beginning. Worst part is I just spent 10 bucks on content...money down the drain. Lesson learned. It\'s a very good game but DON\'T spend money on purchases.',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I downloaded the game, it\'s a great game except for today when I did an update and now won\'t let me get back into the game. Also, really difficult to level up after level 7. Everything is really expensive. Not so much fun when you have to wait along time for money to accumulate. Might delete the game.',
       'While this game is interesting, it doesn\'t really save your progress, so do not attempt to uninstall and then reinstall because you will start from the beginning. Happened to me. There was an issue with the game being unable to download some info after the recent update, so i decided to uninstall and then reinstall. That\'s how I found out.' ,

      'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! 😍💓 AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! 😁 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'A lot of the male characters don\'t show up when I\'m playing. The dialogue and speech box will still be there but I can\'t see any of the male characters, and this only happens with the male characters. I have tried all that I can to make it work, but it won\'t and I have to go through the stories without them being there most of the time. Please fix this for me and I will change my rating, and please allow to create a story in Limelight for mobile, I really wanna make my story but all I have is my phone and I LOVE the Limelight versions.',
       'It\'s such a fun game, no matter what genre you prefer. But I think the chapters are really short and the tickets take way to long to load. If there is no way to make the wait time shorter, at least give me more than 3. Other then that I think episode is a great game',
       'I love this app so much. I love all of the stories ive read  and am reading. The only problem is that although they\'ve added more chances of earning gems they Only give us 2 passes now every 4 hrs. That way to much time to wait for only two passes. Before the update they gave 4 passes every 4 hrs. I think that was better coz u got mire passes with that amount of time  11' ,

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.',
       'One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It\'s interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that\'s there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate' ,

      'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊',
       'The cars are totally good and pls add some more. The traffic is really bad. Because they are inconsiderate and doesn\'t care about other cars. How come some of your games has the traffic considerate, Axesinmotion?🤔🤔 In other words, I hope u will do the things above that is mentioned.' ,

      'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',
       'I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat',
       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',
       'Awesome game but it gets on your nerves a lot and sometimes it\'s way to sensitive, but apart from that I really like the game and it\'s very tense when your playing it as well😘 I love it.🤑' ,

Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',

       'The game is fun. However, most times it takes a long time to "reload" from a previous game especially if you\'ve won some chests. often times the next game has already started and some times even missed out in buying cards for it. Also, When you\'ve leveled up, the prompt screen for this lingers for too long as well. Though I\'m not quite sure if it\'s the game or just my phone.' ,

      'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'This game apparently needs more graphics power than my tablet has. Every time i start to draw, there is a two to three second delay before the line starts moving. The game will lock up momentarily, then skip to where i am in the drawing, leaving out large sections of my solution. And of course, when the game skips ahead, the timer does too. Not a good thing to have happen in a game where every tenth of a second matters.',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.' ,

      'Thought this was a fun game, but since last update an ad pops up after every stinkin\' level.  Not fun anymore.  Especially since there is also a lot of lag time and black screens everytime something is clicked on.  I was fine with the lag time between everything, but can\'t handle that and an ad between every level.  Fix this and I\'ll be inclined to adjust my rating.  Scratch that.  When an ad pops up in the middle of actually playing a level, CONGRATULATIONS!  You just earned an Uninstall.',
       'I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you\'re stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.',
       'I would give this 5 stars, if you could select a level of difficulty, like easy, medium and hard.  It is not relaxing at all, once you pass the early levels. I hate the levels with bullies, you should be able to skip them.',
       'Great game but it continually crashes and freezes and you have to force stop the app to get it working again. Seems to happen when the ads pop up, please fix this! **update - this is getting worse! Every time i lose or win a level the game crashes and I have to force stop',
       'All other games I switch sound and music off as I cannot stand it. Thus one I have left it on as it isn\'t as aggravating as the others.',
       'This feels like a game made by people who don\'t play games. The loading screens are pointlessly long and un-optimised, the menu is over-crowded with buttons and graphics and it\'s hard to navigate because of the sheer amount of stuff on the screen. The levels have very bad difficulty balancing because the types of snacks that are dropped are so random, a level can be considerably easier or harder than intended. Also the amount of pointless notifications popping up about certain challenges expiring are super annoying and there is no in-game setting to turn them off. Besides this, I do appreciate the artwork as I\'ve always been a big Simon\'s Cat fan and the candy-crush with a twist style gameplay is fun, but guys, seriously, take some inspiration from good game developers.' ,

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Do not pull for characters! Trust me. After a few pulls, it is a scam. Choice truly lacks in this game. 30.00 a pull? Omg !!! Not worth it!   I pulled 6 times in a row with no luck. If you want to enjoy this game, don\'t drop a dime. Be patient you get free characters that are better than your pulls.  This is the first game I ever played where you get scammed by characters.  They have a lot of work to do.  Wars last too long,  events don\'t give decent rewards for time you put in.  However, if you can be patient and accept free characters,  you will do ok.  ATTN: big con; you don\'t get characters you want. I.will edit this review on as I play from my experience in the game. Remember,  no one wants to play games with no choice',
       'The last update has caused it to have to load every few times I log in. It takes 4 to 5 minutes each time. Never had this problem before! Can\'t get past prestige rewards screen... I have uninstalled and reinstalled... not happy',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'I love the game it\'s really epic. But one thing that pisses me off is during the tournament for survival after completing a level with 3 stars there is this part where u have to claim tokens ND after claiming the game crashes  ND starts again. So could u please fix that would mean a lot.. otherwise I got no other problems' ,

      'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'For the fact that we can\'t sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it\'s a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it\'s in the real The Sims games.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.' ,

       'Well, I\'ve changing my review. I have now been active for several months, and am disappointed in the lack of development. The events are not touched, it\'s showing Christmas and Thanksgiving for the titles.. hate to point this out, but it\'s almost March. The building scheme is outdated and slow, when you have someone help you out, the difference in building times is a laugh at best. The pack prices once you spend on the lower end packs, never come back down. The minimum price I see now is $9.99. And the game mechanics are a bit slower as well. Customer Service can take up to 24 hours to respond to something in-game, so be prepared to wait, and remember that English is not the first language of support. I\'m still playing for the moment, but it\'s getting to be more of a job then a game. And without paying, be prepared for some waiting. Some of the research even in tier 1 is 11 days of waiting before you can do something else, unless you spend the $25.00 it will be for a second research slot. Oh, and the rate that they open new battlefields up destroys the older battlefields with active populations. So be prepared to see no growth within a week of a new field opening as it\'s the way they keep you in game and spending. I\'m critical of a game that doesn\'t bother to change events, or address the issues in the game. Guess it might be easier to open another flawed battlefield rather then fix the issues across the entire game. And no, I don\'t expect a response from there customer service either.',

       'The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don\'t waste your time',
       'There are far too many ads in game that you have to deal with, and game limitations basically force you to purchase stuff in order to even approach something resembling actual progress. What makes things worse is that there really isn\'t much of an actual game to be played here, just spin once, wait for the ad, spin again, wait for an ad, repeat until you uninstall the game permanently. I\'d only recommend this game to someone looking for an actively painful experience.',
       'I really like this game. It\'s a great time killer but can you please not have the double reward and x2 thing pop up all the time. It is really annoying',
       'Nice game it\'s nice to make a bit of money. But.. there are just to many ads. I do not have a nice and normal experience while using the app. If you can lower the ads it will be a good app. I uninstalled because the ads where way to annoying. Please lower the amount of ads. Thanks',

      'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.',
       'Saw it advertised and gave it a go. Pretty fun, once you understand the tactics it\'s pretty easy but I still like it. If you want to waste time, but not on a Candy Crush rip off, this is it!',
       'I usually can find something "wrong" with almost any app or game, but this is about as close to perfect as I\'ve played or used. I did not find the ads to be *nearly* as bothersome as most games. Good stuff!!',
       'Simple easy game that just let\'s me stop and focus. I don\'t find the ads too bad, gives me a break between boards. I like the occasional board I can\'t figure out right away.',
       'To many adds to the level of being annoying. Game it self is ok but can\'t see myself going through so many challenges to get to higher levels. I\'ll pass.' ,

      'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.',
       'Maybe you could add coins, for example each gate you go through could +1 Coin and you need like 290 Coins to upgrade your airtime by a few seconds or milliseconds, although the sound is not very good due to no sound at all. Very good game although!',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'The game is very enjoyable, and it\'s pleasing to the eyes. I like that you can fall off course and redeem yourself if you make it back within 5 seconds. The ads are pretty excessive though. I\'m all for supporting a free to play game with advertisements, and at first I didn\'t have a problem with the ads. You get an advertisement after every game but they\'re often just picture ads or skippable after 5 seconds. I draw the line when you go e me an ad after every game and there are 30 second ads that you\'re forced to watch. If you\'re going to make me watch an ad give me an ad every 3 to 5 games at least.' ,

      'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!',
       'I landed on the Moon and... I got back to Earth safely on manual control! What\'s with you, you think I\'m expendable?! There is no way to add new destination once the original one is attained. Also it would be great to have a payload that can be carried other then the capsule alone. Other than this is the greatest fun I had in a while.',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It\'s simple and I like it! Couldn\'t figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It\'s KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I\'m sure that\'s on your list.',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it\'s trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      'This update brings improvements to the build system.',
       'Parts now smoothly snap to each other.',
       'Parts now try to not be placed one on another.',
       'This an many other small changes I made should make building a LOT easier.',
       'Please keep giving me feedback about the build system, I still read all the reviews.',
       'Added side facing nose cones (under utility).',
       'Fixed performance issues.',
       'Fixed bug that caused some parts to load incorrectly.',
       'Sorry for so many updates, but this are things that I need to fix.' ,

      'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.' ,

      'This is a really good game. got a great high score and it\'s good when you don\'t know what to do. But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'My absolute all time favorite game! I used to have the woodblock version and would play that one ALL the time. The only thing I didn\'t like about it was that I couldn\'t get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It\'s got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don\'t feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it\'s a good way to get your mind working if you\'re someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒',
       'I like the game itself, but way too many adds and they pop up in the middle of the game and then your piece you are placing goes wonky.  Do away with the adds in the middle. Whoever thought that was a good idea in a puzzle game was completely misplaced.' ,

      'Played many times and game play is ok and its quick to connect to opponents. But the dice suck!! Not sour grapes but all to often when you are in an unbeatable position the opponent will throw 4 doubles or exactly the right sequence of dice to win. This im sure is to encourage payment of coins. Not the best because of this bit could be.  Its a shame it ruins the fun totally!! Edited as the dice really are pants! Ive played many backgammon games online and they do not re-act like these do. There is definatly an issue that needs to be resolved as they don\'t drop as they should. I am sure the other reviews are accurate regarding the dice',

       'Best color by number pixel art I have played. Beautiful art, reasonable controls (would be better if you could click and drag without pressing and holding first, but the only one that does that has such awful art that it doesn\'t matter), it\'s fun. Thanks for making this.',
       'I think that this is a good way for people in high school and middle school to relax and be stress free. My daughter has been using this app since 7th grade and now is a junior in high-school. She suggested that I try it because I am always stressed after work. I did. I love who ever created this game and a BIG THANKS FOR THIS GAME',
       'I love the gameplay, graphics and controls and this is just so relaxing to play! I love this compared to other sandbox games because of the controls are way better! Also when you take a pic and colour it in can you have a palette so you can colour it in different colours to the image that would be great if you could kinda edit photos by using different colours.',
       'Amazing! The only problem is that I might accidentally touch a number I already coloured and undo it. To fix this problem I suggest you make it so if you have completed a number it cannot be changed.',

      'I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I\'m data only) and my tablet says the game isn\'t compatible. It\'s marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it\'s not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I\'m not running a speed test.',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻',
       'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'I Love the Game itself. But the reason I give 4S only is their Support System. It seems that they dont really care about their Players, And also, The game itself is Great from its Interface to its gaming experience. Its all good, but when new updates comes, the game has Always Bugs, and Developers seems so slow to Fix them.',
       'Sorry for giving you low rating. But it\'s been days or weeks idk, it\'s always freezing when I try to open assassins chronicle and soul relic. And it\'s been months I\'m getting messages \'go get your mine\', but no map\'s coming. I can\'t even enter any plunder, for days. Hope you fix that.' ,

      'AMAZING! The graphics are stunning and the story lines are so good! Just 2 things I would improve to make the game even better:      •Less time to wait for more keys (4 hours is quite long).      •The diamond cost is really high considering the fact we get one diamond after every story chapter we play and having to wait so long for keys.  Other than that...AMAZING JOB WELL DONE!',
       'I like interactive stories and some of these are cool. A bit more personalization and less predictability would be nice, but I enjoy the stories. I dislike that many of the choices you have to pay for but it IS a business so I understand. It\'s just that other story apps weren\'t like this. Then again, said apps weren\'t as attractive as these. You can tell a lot of work goes into them visually speaking and in the programming. The stories could get better though.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.',
       'Its honestly GREAT, i love how you can choose what you will say next to change the flow of the story and how will the others will treat you later on. Im talking about ENDLESS SUMMER my most favourite book like BEYOND others..for my opinion. Please make diamonds cheaper in the future cause it really annoys me when you want some choices but you dont have enough diamonds...',
       'I absolutely love this game. i just wish the diamonds and keys werent so expensive. Nobody has $100 to spend on a game. $10 lasted me like 1 day smh...and i have to wait 2 hours everytime i play 2 chapters so please fix that. thats soooo annoying. Id rather PAY for the game once and have unlimited diamonds or please  make the diamonds much much CHEAPER....also itd be cool to make the characters move or place them in the actual scenery in the future.' ,

      'So I am a major mobile gamer.  And I must say this game is awesome in a number of ways. My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on "finish daily or unfurnished daily", I can\'t seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.',
       'Its a good game. One of the nicest mmorpg on the market right now. However, my only nitpick is the lack of customization of the characters. You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn\'t change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.',
       'Man I gotta write this again &gt;~&lt;... The only thing u need to fix is the bug that doesn\'t allows you to see the characters... It really anoys me b/c I\'m a girl and only the boy characters are visible so please fix tgis in the next game update! That\'s the only bug that I have experienced! Anyways everyother thing is *AWESOME* btw my character is the puppeteer if that helps in something',
       'Apparently, my first review is gone. It was just a few minutes ago. So basically, I wanted to create a puppeteer but it does not show the avatar in the character creation screen. Same thing goes with the bounty hunter. I\'ve restarted the app, my phone, and re-installed the game. It\'s the same thing. I only see the scythe and shadow for the puppeteer and shadow for the bounty hunter. I\'m not gonna play this game until this issue is fixed.',
       'I just downloaded this game since it looks very beautiful and enjoyable to play. Unfortunately even though I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 the Puppeteer and Bounty Hunter are invisible in-game, even in the character selection. I will rate this game 1 star until this is fixed and I am able to play the game to it\'s fullest. (I did not play past the character selection)',
       'Kinda like this game....BUT why i cannot see my character?? I dont know what im doing,i just look at the shadow moving..how can i control it if i cannot even see my char?? Just moving and tap the skill without seeing what my char doin,might be not sooo very satisfied..will gve 5stars if this thing fix..would be enjoy if i can see my char fight back there..😒😒' ,

Otherwise, I enjoy the game, although it definitely is not as good as it was when I began playing a few years ago. The payouts are not proportional to the bet played. Graphics are nice, overall game play is very easy. However, I have chips to lose, so would like the issues fixed so that I can play the game.   ***game still will not load past the title page. I have sent 3 emails, a mobile ticket as directed in the reply from the developers, but still nothing.',
       'New  Superdog game is fun, but the gameplay is soooo slow it\'s like watching paint dry.  Only game I have ever played where you can make friends but you cannot delete them. This problem should be addressed. Good selection of games and good graphics.',
       'Best games, worst payouts. If you spend money here you will constantly lose so you spend more. Your greed just lost you a paying customer! Spent over $300 in 3 months only to get robbed almost daily. It\'s utter BS!!',

       'After looking at friends profiles, I\'ve seen NO JACKPOT WINNERS. Since I\'ve had this game downloaded(few years), gift giving has diminished due to game allowance, receiving has definitely slowed way down. Still better than most casino games... Greed is setting in on the company.',
       'Sorry it is not polite what I have to say about this site. Nothing changes. Daily spins I managed to get 7,000 credits not enough to play one game. Would not recommend to my friends they would be wasting time and money.!!!!!!' ,

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls',
       'Addictive When my internet is streaming I can\'t play as the lag is too bad. The adverts are a little irritating but out of peak times are few and far between. Other than that I freaking love this game : )' ,

      'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'I\'ve reached on level 93 been at it for almost a week now. And it makes absolute no sense no matter which way I go. For example I will shoot a blue colour to burst the same colour and another colour shoots out. Can you fix this? It\'s frustrating. It\'s a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.' ,

      'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'I love playing this game but id give it no stars seeming that there are so many ads and when I collected enough stars for a ghost bike I DIDNT GET IT!! HORRIBLE!! unless you can fix this, you\'re not getting a good review on my hand. Oh and also, for anyone wanting to know, it\'s 21 dollars a month for some bikes. Not in real life. Wow such a great deal... No really a great deal.' ,

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not.

       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'It\'s a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don\'t like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀' ,

       'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

       'Its a fun game however there are hackers,scammers ,glitches and its really annoying when the game freezes. Also when people post art books they can be really inappropriate. I think you should be at least  13 to play this game because of the inappropriate art books. I think the new update is great but I would like it if we would make n buy wish list on tablet and  on phone. Its a fun game but you reply need to think about who you can trust because many people just ply with your feelings.',

      'wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁',
       'I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it\'s so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You\'re clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I\'m only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.',
       'Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous"Candy Crush" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can\'t seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can\'t stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.',
       'Very good game, very addictive, but unfortunately the birds theme and the circus theme are not very good. They are not so sensitive to touch and jump late. My favourite is the farm one. Love the little cow :) Later update: I love the new updates what let me combine any characters with any theme, and the fever mode is cute ;)' ,

       'Really like this game I give it only three stars or two just because on the 6th or 7th or 5th it gets really hard because I think on this six you have to play a game and the arrows weren\'t showing up and then I think on the 7th it gets harder because they\'re the sky and it\'s a circle and Eric trying to get to Mia but he can\'t do that dress because the guys keep on knocking into the guy Eric keeps on knocking into the guy but that\'s not his fault because the guy keeps on coming for him which that\'s not what it was supposed to be it said is going to just guard me if I don\'t give it a zero from 1 to 10 5 from 1 to 10 because 5% of that I hate it by a person of it I like it I don\'t even love it I don\'t even want to say love in this one because it\'s not that good of a game so I want to play it and if you\'re wondering why I rate this game is because I\'m on the like 6 or 7th and it\'s really hard so I would I wouldn\'t play this game if you want a hard game that will that is just making that guy win you\'ll keep on having to do it and do it and do it and do it and do it and do it and do it but you\'ll never win because the guy always wins he has a hoodie on and on his shirt if I were to if I were to do this on a mermaid secret seven.',
       'Annoying ads. Can\'t get past the car level. Boring after level 2. Sensitive.',
       'There are so many ads and everything is locked so no one can do anything in the game. The faces Alan makes are funny though.',

      'In short, the only really bad thing about this game is the _gigantic_ amount of data required to download this game. Hey not everybody has wifi. Some of us have to use our data for everyday life and this game will eat a lot. Won\'t be able to rate this big pig because I have much better things to do with my data. Uninstalled.',
       'You can\'t do anything to get out of not having food but  buy it with you real money.  Not exchange options or games or spins or videos even you just can\'t do anything. This not fun. You can\'t collect the food even if you grow it. Since I did have enough gems wood or food to build the warehouse I\'m screwed with no options  but to quit the game. Sucks it could have been good. I\'m done. It\'s sad that with all the bad reviews you don\'t choose to change any of those features to improve the quality and keep more users to continue play.',
       'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective. I will be deleting now at level 6',
       'It glitches too much.  To actually beat any islands, you have to spend money.  I think that you should make it possible to play without spending money',
       'Too much waiting if you\'re broke. I was expecting to find the brain teasers advertised on Facebook, but it\'s more like Minecraft except it costs something to do most functions. I do enjoy the storylines, but it takes forever to get through them.',
       'I love the game. However, the tasks that you must complete. You have to spend a lot of money to complete them. If the gems, apples, or cans can be used with less cost (digging, plants, completing the tasks at hand). I\'d refer a lot more friends to the game. the' ,

      'Fun but shouldn\'t put ads when the game just started Should have given it five star if it wasn\'t for the ads. A really nice, fun and cute game. Somehow whenever I started the game three second ads will be popping up. I hope that the ads will show up at other times, not when the game started. I\'ll be thankful if this problem could be fixed. Liked the game very much though.',
       'The Penguin game of adventure🐧🐟🎆 Not just penguins🐧 being my Favourite animal,This is the game of adventure! If Finn and Jake (from adventure time) Were real they would totally rate this a 5 Star rating! New penguins, lots of fishes🐟 to Collect and also super Power-Ups🎆! Who could possibly rate this FANTASTIC  game with 1 STAR?!?!?!??🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌',
       'I &lt;3 it! I love super penguins! I showed it to my 11 year old brother and he loves it! And I showed it to my dad. He likes it 2. It is so addicting! The only thing that annoys me is that when there is a tied up penguin and I miss it I feel bad I know it is just a game, but the squeals and the whining, it makes me sad will give 5 stars if fixed.',
       'A little fine tuning and sharpening. Maybe more idealistic goals for the avid fan bc of the free usage. More incentives that are attainable for the player! Other than that I would give this game and maybe a three and a half stars',
       'I love Super Penguins. Super Penguins is a fun game. Perfect for kids who  love penguins. My daughter is a superfan of the game and plays it far too much!. This morning she was jumping up to try and grab my phone and saying " Dad, give me your phone I wanna play Super Penguins!!!"',
       'Very cute game. It\'s nice to play to kill a few minutes. So far, I haven\'t needed to purchase anything to advance.  That\'s a HUGE plus for me. I delete games that want money so you can advance. Kid appropriate too!' ,

      'Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!',
       'Best curling game I\'ve seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don\'t make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don\'t react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy',
       'Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don\'t waste your money in upgrades',
       'Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad.',
       'Not bad for free. Minimal ads. The two drawbacks are that in career mode, the game is slanted in the opponents favour too much. And in 1 on 1, it takes forever to load an opponent. Fix that and I would give it a five star rating. Also, it would be nice to see the developer actually respond to some people\'s concerns.',
       'Nice game Not true curling but closer then any game I have played so far and it\'s still fun.  There seems to be a glich where stones jump to a different position after the throw, but doesn\'t happen often.  There is no hog line violation and it\'s difficult to promote so most games end up being a culster f in the 4ft.  Once you realize it\'s a game and not real curling your addicted.' ,

      'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Love this game but keeps freezing, a lot! It\'s more frustrating since the update where it costs 30 coins for the telescope but only get 5 minutes instead of 10 now and half the time my games frozen and the time runs out FIXXX',
       'This latest update keeps freezing up. I have to close it out completely and restart it. I lose any powerups I was using when it freezes, too. I cannot even finish playing the mighty levels the last few days because of this issue. Very annoyed.',
       'Wth ! Game gets hanged, as soon as you use mighty scope in mighty league. Not one time, or occasionally. Everytime since last update. WHAT A MESS ! Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.' ,

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',

Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍',
       'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game☺',
       'This game is both funny as serious it\'s a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine\'s) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I\'m unsure it this is the game or my phone.' ,

      'Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I\'m very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It\'s a FREE APP.',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.',
       'I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.',
       'Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I\'ve only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.',
       'I\'m not quite sure what\'s happened to this game. It\'s very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android\'s OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it\'s going, now it\'s just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it\'s own update.' ,

      'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',

      'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'Excellent game, can\'t wait for a new map. There isn\'t any tutorials but it\'s quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don\'t make it too easy on us high levels now : )',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Lots of work to do on this game. It\'s very SOLID in gameplay and possibilites, but lacks a lot of content. Needs to gather gold while away from the game, as the grind is tremendous right now! There is no purpose in leveling up your mine past lvl 5 right now. It doesn\'t do anything. The game is very incomplete, but has a ton of potential.' ,

      'Dear EA Sports: We really want to get the icon Ronaldinho but its changed and its very hard. Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks☺',
       'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Ya this is sure that this game is awesome but please make the gameplay same as real FIFA such as at a time 2players can play in a team and can control a team. One more request is that, that you should change the graphics because players in this game are not looking as the real one. I am waiting for the next version if this eagerly hope you make this changes in this game',
       'Can you please make the following improvements then your game will rule the playstore. 1) Make your graphics good. Sometimes one can\'t even recognise the player. 2) Add  real referee there on the pitch. 3) Add a feature of commentary in all languages. 4) Add an option of the records of every individual player\'s stats, goals, assists and all. 5) Add some weather conditions,night mode, attendance. 5) Add a number of more celebrations and especially player\'s signature celebration.  Please take a look on my review and make the game more beautiful.' ,

      'This is not a legitimate game. All the artwork and animation featured in the game design is plagiarised from Kevin Gemin, a freelance artist on several platforms. To take and profit from the hard work of an artist and not credit them let alone ask permission is below the scum of the earth. Don\'t download this trash and instead allow me to redirect to the proper source of "inspiration." YouTube - kekeflipnote Tumblr - k-eke Tumblr Twitter - @Kekeflipnote Facebook - @Kekeflipnote Deviantart - kokorokeke Patreon - Keke',
       'All artwork in this game was a ripped animation from kékéflipnote. Do not rate this game high. It\'s committed a crime. It\'s not even subtle about it. The game literally uses the exact same animation but retextured. If you want to help go to the bottom of this page and report it for copycat/impersonation, or go into other and write plaigarism.',
       'The animations in this game are blatantly plagiarized from Kevin Gremin. You would think that a small indie studio would be respectful of freelance artists and their work, but that\'s not the case with Fortafy Games. This is shameful and needs to be removed from this platform, along with apologies and compensation to the artists you stole from.',
       'I can\'t believe how obviously plagiarised the art and animations are in this! Kévin Gemin\'s animations always bring a smile to my face, and seeing his work so blatantly stolen like this is heartbreaking. For those that enjoy the animations in this game, please check out the original artist\'s work at k-eke on Tumblr / kekeflipnote on Twitter / kokorokeke on DeviantArt.',
       'Wonderful, two companies working together to rip off one artist\'s (K-eke) gimmick. It\'s pulled off so decently that it\'s infuriating. Get yourselves both a spine and work on ideas without plagiarising other people\'s content that they themselves depend very much on. Here\'s what you need to do, WORK on ORIGINAL ideas. If you were thoughtful enough of crediting a Tom Garett for the music what about the concept of the animations? Two companies worth of people just missed it I suppose, fantastic.',
       'I wish I could give this plagiarized piece of trash you tried to pass off as an original game zero stars! You blantantly stole the animations from Kekeflipnote, a person of actual talent! You truly are a scumbag in every sense of the word.' ,

      'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts 💚 are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Most irritating game plan.  Have any one ever seen in real game that if a player miss a goal then all the previous goals are cancelled? But in this game such thing is happening. You should not cancel all the goals scored only for a miss or loss of a ball. Goals should be saved and to be started from where it stopped for missing a goal or losing a ball. Developer should take it into his consideration.',
       'Do you know what? This game is really bad. If you\'re calling this game really good, then you must be blind. The graphics are really bad, it is really laggy and whenever someone puts in a review, you don\'t fix it. You never do any updates to impove this game also. And the fact that you have to wait for your hearts to regen is so annoying. You should remove the hearts *now*. That is why I think this game is so bad and that I rate this game 1☆.' ,

That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'I\'m a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission\'s then Lloyd hacked into Zane\'s computer he said something I just have a bad memory.',
       'I think the controls are horrible because I Am left handed and you\'ve got to use your right hand to go forward and there is not much of fighting or ningargo feeling',
       'No controller support on Android TV. Very buggy playing on a tablet. Character gets stuck behind/in objects and you have to kill the game...',
       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',
       'It\'s amazing I love it I like how you can make your own ninja and have any weapons it\'s one of the best games I\'ve ever played I have it on all my devices it always puts my in a good mood a job well done plus I\'ve saw every episode and the movie I\'m a huge fan got lots of the sets (5) stars keep it up' ,

It has no problem playing adverts before crashing,  however.  Used to be therapeutic,and now it\'s just a frustrating exercise in cruelty.  Fix the bugs,  or take this game off the Net. Luring people in to watch a video, and then watch their work crash is wrong and mean.',
       'Why is game no longer working??? Glitches EVERY TIME i try to submit a drawing, so i can NEVER complete a turn.. Even after the update, no correction has been made. Used to be a fun game but now it just constantly sends me notifications for no reason, because i can\'t submit drawings.. PLEASE FIX',
       'I remember once in like 2010-2013 when I was little, me, my brother, and two of my cousins were all playing this together with random people. We were playing with this guy who just wrote the words, and my brother, who was the oldest out of us, was pretty pissed. Our word to draw was "eggplant ((͡° ͜ʖ ͡°))" and he wrote on the drawing, "I swear if you write one more word I will find you and you will regret it" and proceded to draw a pool of blood and a tiny eggplant with an arrow pointing to it. So if youre that guy we were playing with, sorry I guess. :/',
       'My only complaint about the game is that after trying to shut off the random games, it still sends me strangers game requests.  And the delete button doesn\'t always pop up.',
       'It\'s a great game. But can I say, the ads can get pretty annoying. A lot of them, you can\'t even skip unless you\'ve stated at them for a certain amount of time. Also annoying is how every time I go to guess a drawing, a pop up comes up asking if I want to watch a video for free bombs. Like maybe have it pop up if I\'ve been stuck on one for a while, stop having that pop up appear right away and less frequent.' ,

      'Overall super fun game and I\'m really enjoying it, however some of these levels are really easy, and then there are others that are super challenging and nearly impossible to find out. I just wish there was a difficulty setting so you start off with easier games and then it could get harder as it progresses, because at the moment I can\'t pass 70% of the levels without using hints.',
       'They made me misspell Rabbids, including "games" like Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan, and had obscure art that gave really bad visualization of very simple things. Just play a better trivia game. Moreover. Don\'t give us awful games like Unity, Watch Dogs, and League of Legends. Anime is anime. Video games are video games. Video game adaptations of anime are still, at there core, anime. Leave those out of these kinds of apps.',
       'It crashed alot and seemed to be a very obscure game set to guess I did like it but found it to be more towards a different game variety iif you only play large name games like NFS or cod don\'t play this it won\'t be for you',
       'it\'s a weird mix, one one hand you can just tell what game it\'s from and then it throws you a curve ball...some of these seem so under the radar or you have to literally know EVERY GAME to get by without hints',
       'The graphics were awesome and now you can barely tell what the image is I loved this game now well not so much because um I can\'t play it without asking myself who in their right mind would downgrade the graphics?!?!',
       'Legit only mobile games its not I gaming quiz. They could of at least put more console or pc games who would even know all of the mobile games out there.aswell if you don\'t know it you will have to watch a add that can be 1min long. You might as well just watch youtube or twitch.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '♦ UPDATE ♦',
       '• Android Oreo (8.0 & above) has been re-included.',
       'For some reasons, Android Oreo has some issues with Unity 3D (our game engine). Fortunatelly, we hardworked until the fix of that problem so NOW ANDROID OREO CAN PLAY OUR APPLICATION. In the other hand, we couldn\'t make the advertisements work for that android versions so mind that if you try to watch any ad, the game can crash.' ,

Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don\'t think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant',
       'Damn you Pretty Simple... damn you & your ridiculously addictive Criminal Case games!!  How about the next series to be set in space?  I\'d be VERY curious to see what your creative geniuses could do with that concept!!',
       'I am excited to play this game. I have been playing the other 3 but had forgotten how slow it is to start. Once you get to where you can get power ups the game play is much faster',
       'I  like the new Criminal Case. This is my 4th one I\'m playing. If I can i will play them all' ,

      'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn\'t find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won\'t get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you' ,

       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',

      'You just scammed me. I downloaded the app, opened it and it said congrats on buying 1500 gems. I DID NOT APPROVE THIS. THIS IS THEFT.  No warning or anything, just loaded it and poof, I had gems.    I will be calling my bank tomorrow to reverse this. Unbelievable.',

I would love it if you could build more of this games and I would be sure to download it! Keep working hard!   Best regards ~Isaac Mack Kai Yong',
       'Would be a great game if it would stop crashing! Wanna double up on the money you\'ve collected? Sorry, game crashed. Want to get the Ice Cream truck going for bigger profits? Sorry, game crashed. Good game, right until it sucks. Would even be enticed to spend a little real cash if the game money I should be earning would actually be there. But alas no, the game crashed.',
       'Gave 3 stars on some area because i lost my city and i don\'t know what happened and how i can get it back. I hope someone from game dev will help and I\'ll the game a full 5 star rating.',
       'Has daily rewards, not necessarily keep playing or keep online. Check regularly is good too. I don\'t really like the card type building, like leveling up from gatcha, but, the odds for free player is good enough in this game. All in all, great game.' ,

But then it has lots of ads everytime i arrive at the green light and also when purchasing weapon at the weapon shop😣😣 its also difficult to climb up the hill or mountain especially when i accidentally fall into the sea.

      'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn\'t. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I\'m not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I\'m the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I\'m not trying to be mean so don\'t go crying😢 to ur boss.',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',
       'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot' ,

      'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.' ,

Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it\'s just a matter of the game not working.',
       'Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.',
       'Got stuck playing til lvl 40 before I realized an hour had past, and I only came to the play store looking for sonic 3, but this looked interesting listed under "recomended." Great recommendation.',
       'Some levels are straight forward. Others you just have to skip because there\'s no logic or something is missing. Could be good with some type of help if you get stuck rather than just skipping an entire level.',
       'Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I\'m at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.',
       'Items don\'t move when they are supposed to therefore making it impossible to complete each task. It is very frustrating because the game would be more fun. It would make it more enjoyable with at least 1 or 2 hints.' ,

      'I wanted to give 5 stars but when l reached 16 th level....... It came like if you want to open other levels then watch a video...... I don\'t have problem in this..... Then it came like - video unavailable check your internet connection... Dont know why.. Mobile data is on then also. This is the bad point of this game',
       'The ball is super hard to control. Half the time I\'m swiping over and over again just to make the ball move. The game acts like it is super easy when it is the hardest task to do. I\'m also being spammed with ads because once or twice you restart the level because you lost an ad plays. Plys the ads take me to Google Play without me touching the screen or tapping on download. And since the controls are a nightmare because of lines glitching around the ball, (thus making it not move a single centimeter) I have to watch an ad. or lines just glitching themselves. And finally, this game spams me with notifications to "thumbs up" you and download your other games. I\'m obviously NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING YOU WITH ADS!',
       'Don\'t get me wrong this game is fun and gets your brain thinking but I hate how many adds it has. Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',
       'The ads are forced onto you, and that is the worse system I\'ve seen yet. The controls are pretty good if you have an s pen. Most puzzles are way to easy.',
       'Too many ads and it glitches like crazy. Needs more levels, other than that it was a good game.',
       'I hate it. It won\'t let me hit any buttons' ,

Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over £200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!',
       'Was fun while it lasted. Now I can\'t even login to the game. "Disconnected from server" over and over. I troubleshot the issue on my end. No instructions on how to link the game to Kongregate so I can\'t do a fresh install of the game without losing everything. My network is stable. Never had this problem on My other game I\'ve ever played.  And if all you do think the account is sign in to kong in game, did that; then went to the site and it\'s not linked.' ,

      'I love this game, but it will be much better if it contains gallery of my own creation and... Moreover, it will be addictive if say for eg. after scorring 10,000, 30,000.. coins, more features can be unlock. And yah, it will be fabulous if we can update more facilities. But now, after earning more coins, I want to uninstell it because there is no more options left, no more reasons to play.',
       'Fantastic and very creative game... I give it 4 stars... And leave 1 star only because its brushes are not free after african.... it is my humble request to developers that please provide some more brushes for free.... And if possible (free the whole brushes 😋)... Ha ha ha ha... Nice job developers....👍👍👍 Akash Prafulla Barik "Baadal" (India)',
       'Loved this game! A relaxing timekiller when you have nothing else to do. Quite addicting as well. Inspires me to do pottery in real life! The only things I don\'t like is that you have to buy the full version for $5, alhough if it was entirely free I\'d probably get bombarded by ads.. A fun game, nonetheless!',
       'It\'s just that you have to make the full version download free. We don\'t have to make the payment of the Game. When we download the game in the starting of the game we get message but after that we don\'t. Now l\'m bored \'cause the messages for making new pots are not coming...... Pls just make it what l\'m saying. But baki all is a good job..............................',
       'I installed it for time pass, but my 21 month old baby without even we teaching her how to play, learned it on her own, and she is an expert. She gets scores as high as 272. I know it is very bad for such small baby to play in mobile, but sh gets very upset.',
       'Its fun, but after a while it makes you pay 5$ for the full version. You can keep playing and buying things but eventually you buy everything and it becomes a little boring. Nevertheless its still a fun/ok game.' ,

      'I like all the options. If I am having a bad day, I can select fewer pieces, and thus an easier puzzle. If I want a challenge,  I can select a large number of pieces.  You can change the background so you can see the pieces better. You have the choice of rotating the pieces (or not). One of my favorite features is the one which helps work the edge pieces first. Good game, hours of entertainment,  reasonable prices to buy more puzzles. What\'s not to love?',
       'It\'s all right. It has a pretty small selection of puzzles, unless you pay. Like most of these jigsaw puzzle apps, it doesn\'t really challenge you too much, but it is relaxing and the pics you do get are high quality.  Just meh. Would recommend if you like puzzles to unwind. But you can honestly probably find 100 very identical apps in a few short moments and they\'d probably give you the same experience. Maybe even with less ads and payment-exclusive content.',
       'I love the puzzles, the pictures are beautiful. I still get pop up ads even though I bought the puzzle pack that\'s supposed to remove ads. And now they added more ads. When you pick a puzzle and push play, it shows an ad before taking you to the puzzle.....every single time. I\'m done with this app unless they fix the annoying ads. I understand needing ads, but it has become so much that it kills any enjoyment this app used to bring.',
       'Any time there are people in the puzzles they are blindingly white. Can we get some puzzles that include people of color??  Update 1/23: Increasingly glitchy. First it force closed a lot, causing you to have to start all over. Now, it crashes and causes my tablet to restart. This is a multiple times daily occurrence. Not worth the hassle. After all this time I\'m going to go ahead and uninstall.',
       'Used to be a great game. Latest android version is full of bugs and continuously crashes! To get back your puzzle you have to watch at least 2 30 second videos and the the screen will mess up again and you have to restart and watch another video and maybe you get to finish your puzzle.  Has become a real bummer!',
       'I loved this app and worked on the puzzles everyday until you started requiring us to watch a video before each time to get to the puzzles. I have not been able to even get to the puzzle after watching the ad video. It comes back to the puzzle selection screen and shows it with the puzzle underneath it open. It\'s like viewing two screens at the same time. PLEASE fix this issue and I would give it a 5 star rating across the board.' ,

Constant lag, hard to control, the view is zoomed way in so you never see anyone bigger coming your way, full of adds, and the game constantly crashes and kicks me out.

On days when I feel like going through all of this I have to go through the constant ads that me have to go through hell and back to exit... So I assume, maybe rush? NOPE rush has teams left to right as well... please fix the lagging problems and find a way to terminate teamers or make lobby\'s smaller so nobody would see a reason to team, and when that\'s done I\'ll rate you 5 stars.',

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!

      'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!',
       'After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. 😄  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it\'s time for me to kill more zombies 😎',
       'I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn\'t have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time',
       'Be better if i dont get all wepons down to a double barrel and pistol after months of gameplay.   Second time this happened so far.  Good game and story but gota work out the bugs.  Cant play level 8 with a level 1 guns.   Uninstalled the game.  Waste good money playin this online',
       'Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it.',

      'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'Game is great. And like every game had it\'s pro\'s and con\'s. To sum this game up in short it is Top Trumps with the race.   Pros: game is different to all the rest out there, car list is really well thought out as well.  Cons the only things I have to say is, it\'s so hard to win decent cars sometimes. Seems quite a pay to win game as card packs are alot of money/gold and you don\'t win alot of money either.   One thing to bare in mind is that once you\'ve completed a level you can go back and claim all the cards from that event giving you more money, cars and rq.',
       'This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.',
       'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',

      'This is the best tap games out there. It really loves up to its word saying to timers, unlike SimCity and just about every other game out there. Its easy to play and advance so it sets a wide age range. I would like to personally thank the devs for coming out with this game, something a was looking for for a while. 10/10. Keep up the good work!',
       'I was very surprised  at the diversity of things you can do. And you can speed up EVERYTHING MANUALLY. Ads are optional with selective rewards of either money or one of the three materials you use to build stuff with. The exclusive currency can be bought with irl money or exchanged for materials or in-game cash. Not like any tap game I\'ve ever played, I\'m very impressed! This is a keeper!',
       'I adore this game, it\'s such a time waster (in a good way)! I wish that the camera controls were compatible with wireless mice. only reason being is because I broke my screen and I can\'t use too much touch screen. :( apart fro',
       'Absolutely love this game, its customisable and you make your city however you want to. One thing I eould like to see is alternative buildings, like instead of a power plant, a hydro plant. Also plz add buildings that can go in the ocean like bridges. Overall love it',
       'It is true that there is no timer but instead your energy runs out very fast! At the end it takes too much time to build a real city!  Also has nothing innovative comparing to other games.',
       'Absolutely excellent! I love the freedom of building whatever you like within reason. One thing that could improve it, and it might just be me thinking this, is that the buildings look different as you level them up. I do know that they look different at level 5, but at other levels it would be great, so you remember what level a building is. The idea that each building looks different, regardless of the type of building is still awesome, because it adds a slight feeling of difference and uniqueness. For example, I have come across at least 3 types of apartment and office, so my city/town doesn\'t all look the same. Keep up the good work! 👍' ,

In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'I would like to give a better rating, since my 3yld loves this app.  But the newest babies are not working and there is no support on the Disney app page.  Would love to get this issue reported and fixed before they try to screw everyone over with 3 more dolls that freeze the game.',
       'My daughter loves this game and plays it all the time. I just bought her all of the last babies today for her to have them all and the bottle freezes and she can\'t play with her new babies. If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',
       'Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!' ,

      'This game is AMAZING! With that said, heres the problem. Stop with the obnoxious freaking monkey!!!! Im sick of him popping up every 30 secs with no skip button. Ill be getting up a good tapping speed and it will jist ruin it by popping up with no option to click off. If i want to explore the game further, i will, at my own pace. I dont need you to hold my hand. Its really spammy and ruining the game play. Tutorial based gaming is a waste and a headache. Also its laggy. Please fix this. I LOVE this game and i want to play but the spammy monkey is a deal breaker.  Rant over',
       'I like the game very much. I bought the starter pack for a dollar 99 and removed ads. After the update came out, the one that and the ability to watch a video to double your rewards, your offline rewards, I click to watch the video and then the game sends me to the store to buy a gem pack. I click off of that and then it says the video is not available. I assume it wants me to buy another gem pack in order to enable that feature. I will not be doing that as that is ridiculous. I already bought the starter pack. Please fix this as the game is very fun and addictive.',
       'One of the most obnoxiously money grabbing games i played. Commercials popping out constantly, and the rewards for watching them are more often than not just worthless. It\'s a shame because the game is quite fun to play otherwise',
       'It was fun, but im slowly starting to hate it. One moment youre just looking at youre businesses and the next they are shoving ads down your throat. I shouldnt have to look at ads unless i get something in return.',
       'The tutorial will not let me play the game, it continues to interrupt me and forces me to do what it wants. Graphics are also cheap and ugly looking. It also feels janky, and buggy to control. I wish I could enjoy this otherwise decent idle game.',
       'Game is great. There an ad that keeps popping up for "Coin Masters" that wants nothing to do with closing. So I gotta force stop my game. Other than that great game' ,

      'It\'s kinda fun but it\'s definitely "pay to win".  Best gun wins hands down.  Every gun can be earned through play but it takes a while.  Guess the developers gotta get paid.  Also, tons of kill stealing.  All in all, not terrible.  Update after couple weeks:  It\'s been fun but now that I\'m in the top league it is all pay to win.  I can\'t earn cash and gold fast enough to buy competitive guns or level the one I have.  I also can\'t win gun fights with the weapons I have.  It\'s a shame that they set it up this way.',
       'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you do😕.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happy😊.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!' ,

       'FORCED ADS! I loved playing this game for years but had to bring the rating down atleast one star because of the forced ads that I usually refuse to watch in games. So now my sessions playing this game end as soon as an ad shows up. Very disappointed.',

       'The ads are ever increasing, I don\'t pay for games and being forced more and more is a deterrent to continue playing. Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',
       'It\'s a fun game, great for passing the time. That being said it suffers some very problematic connection issues, if I tab away for even half a second it disconnects me and causes and auto loss',
       'I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you\'re connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I\'ve lost loads of battle\'s that where going really well then lose connection and it won\'t reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads.' ,

      'The game could be great if not for the really poor choice of words. Why would you include words such as \'shooting, suffers, fur, sue\'  into a game that is supposed to be nice a relaxing? And these are words just from one of the levels. Each level has some words I\'d rather not read or even think about. Nice pictures and vibe though. Please do something about the choice of words. You don\'t want people think about \'shooting\' if only for a brief moment not in this day and age.',
       '👇Earn.Free.Money👇 înstaII \'VEARN\' App Entet (RERA) to Start Earnings So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. uno points equals cs instead of like some of the others where it takes uno points to reach cs etc....Also, TOYOCASH App very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Giftz. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'They repeated words a lot. Also, words that exist aren\'t always counted. And some words that were counted in some rounds aren\'t counted for others. For example, ale has been a valid word for most of the levels but not for some of them. When I first started playing, did was not accepted and then became accepted as my level got higher. Sloppy work, and it\'s so frustrating. The level I\'m on right now, for example, is not accepting "wad" "wed " or "dew"',
       'Far too many ads, overly simple, and you take off points for words that ARE WORDS but aren\'t included in said round\'s dictionary.  Like a glorified boggle. Nothing like what that ad I clicked for this app advertised at all. I\'d give 0 stars if that was an option.',
       '15 minutes. 15 of them and this word game still has not loaded. How long does it take? 1st a black screen. Then a loading screen that takes so long I have no idea of what screen is nxt.

      'Meget god app men små justeringer skulle tilføjes og flere små præmier  som kunne får på selve spillepladen',
       'Syns det er en meget sjov app, men efter at have factory reset min telefon kan jeg ikke længere logge ind, den siger jeg kan kun logge ind et sted, men er ikke logget ind nogen steder.',
       'God app. Har givet en grund til at se reklamer.',
       'God ide, men dårlig udførelse. I en digital verden hvor mit gammeldags TV abonnement for længest er udskiftet med TV2 Play er det simpelthen ikke holdbart at man ikke har en udgave som "synkronisere med TV2 Play" (forsinkelse på ca 1 minut). Det gør app\'en fuldstændig ubrugelig og man er efterladt i en situation hvor det eneste man kan gøre er at sidde og klikke på alle muligheder på skift, konstant i de minutter reklamerne kører.  Jeg forstår hvordan det kan være vanskeligt. En nøjagtige synkronisering er umulig når reklamerne (TV2 Play) afspiller er en anden device (fx Smart TV) end den Reklame Bingo kører på. Men så lad folk gætte en rækkefølge af reklamer og få point efter hvor mange rigtige de har. Eller sørg for brugeren kun kan gætte en gang per reklame (så når brugeren starter sit første gæt, betyder det reklame blokken er startet hus brugeren) eller hvad ved jeg.  I mangler dygtige udviklere som løser sådan nogle problemer. Forstår ikke i kan stille jer tilfredse med den løsning i har nu.',
       'Sjovt koncept, men dårlig udførelse. Som flere siger, så er signalet bagud på Play, og halvdelen af gangene kan jeg ikke indløse brikkerne, selvom jeg har set reklamen.',
       'Som andre nævner det..hvis du har TV2 PLAY, så er signalet 2 min bagud i forhold til kabel tv.. og når ens egen service ikke kan matche med en konkurrence man selv kører, virker det i min optik meget useriøst. Håber på at det kan løses med et lille if statement ved at blandt andet at tjekke om en bruger har TV2 PLAY og tillade delay på input' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I\'m starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'It\'s been at least 3 or 4 weeks since I\'ve been able to accept any lives given by friends. For a game that has so many downloads, developers sure have an issue addressing mad fixing it. I\'ve list roughly 100 lives to this issue. Please fix it!!!',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.' ,

       'IT\'S SO CUTE! I LOVE IT! I JUST HAVE 3 SUGGESTIONS.  1. CAN YOU ADD A BOOKSHELF INTO THE BED ROOM SO WE CAN READ TO OUR BUNNY? 2. WHEN RUBBING THE BUNNY IT PURRS LIKE A CAT? PLEASE CHANGE IT( I\'M GUESSING YOU GOT THE PURRING IDEA FROM MY TALKING ANGELA).3.I CAN\'T BRUSH HER TEETH ONLY USE THAT SUCTION THING PLEASE FIX THIS!  BUT OVERALL A VERY CUTE AND FUN GAME TO KILL TIME!',
       'It\'s so cute. I cant even describe how great it feels when youve been gone for a long time, then you come back to the app and see you have like 30 likes or so. It just makes you feel acomplished. I also enjoy how its not a pay to win game.',
       'Well, it\'s really a pretty game, and quite similar to Angela and Tom the cats, but it has unique mini games and a map and this is a plus, but a disadvantage is in the work of game. There is always bags! A lot of them. For example I choose white hair colour, but next time I\'m into the game it\'s changed into blue! It happened every time. Mini games are running not as smooth as in the beginning, so you can\'t continue to play. Sometimes, when you get new items of clothes and try them on, there is now bunny to see them on her, and then there is only the white screen and game closed. Please, fix it, and I\'ll instal this app with pleasure one more time.' ,

      'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.',
       'You guys made a really good game honestly. Just one thing that gets me tho, when you win fights you get to fight stronger and stronger opponents that\'s a great idea btw. It\'s just that most of the time I ended up fighting someone that has 800 + power and I\'m at 550. Like bro. Come on.  One more thing. The chess take to long really you guys need to fix that. Other than that it\'s an awesome game. No lie',
       'For the most part, pay to win and the enemies get to the point where they take 40 percent of your health. Another thing is, enemies know your every move and will counter, combo you almost every time. Also, you can only play this like 20 mins a day due to the fact that everything is timed and you have to wait like 4 hours till you can do anything. SF2 is still hands down my favorite.',
       'you didn\'t fix any bugs. you only added them. there are points where you attack the enemy but your weapon goes right through them with no damage. Keep this up, Nekki! You\'re doing great!',
       'Well, maybe batter than the previous game in animation but... its lacking control and the game sometimes laging. I cant progress after cwrtain level, and have to buy with coin/ gem. Its good enough but can be better',
       'Good graphics but sometimes when you are winning, opponents takes your 60% to 70% health in one move. Sometimes cannot clear some levels because difficulty remains impossible nevertheless how many times you upgrade your weapons. Not recommended game' ,

      'Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time',
       'The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it\'s difficulty like crazy, I can\'t get past the 200s. Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',
       'I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I\'m in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it',
       'When I try to continue, the game after watching the ad, the game doesn\'t keep counting my score. The challenges are really hard, but fun. Good Game!!',
       'The problem is that every time it asks me if I would like to continue I say yes and then kicks me out of the game',

      'I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it\'s the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.',
       'i think it\'s really good every single detail of it is the best only yu should add different zombies that give u power -ups and special effects The next thing is what I said yu should add it into the second one yu could make. The last thing is in the 2 one yu should make it so when an amount a zombies yu get yu get special powers,boost, and cool stuff. Plz make what I just said it would me so awesome if yu did. I\'m begging do it it is my first time ever making a short statement If I misspelled anything I\'m so sorry and for how long this is☺.I  love this game do it💖' ,

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'Been playing and I love it very addictive.wish they actually give u the dice on scratch off cards.. in the tournament\'s and the showdown after getting so far, it\'s like they want let you win any more the computer wins every time and I don\'t think it\'s right when it want let you see the last roll of the apponement, and they always show computer beating you by 3 points but never shows the last roll.',
       'Its ok if you play against other people but if you play any of the challenges they have against the computer  you lose. They give so many days and you get nothing and have 0 across your board but the computer gas 3 plus yahtzees and over 300 points everytime. Not just 1 or 3 this is 32 times I\'ve played and it\'s happened. Just not worth it if you can\'t win a single challenge honestly. Update they have issues now when you play their computers you can be 150 points ahead of them and the computer magically wins with 1 roll',
       'Fun game overall....... Except when you play the \'showdowns\' the computer is nearly impossible to beat and matches you almost play for play, you end up losing... So needless to say, I would give 5 stars, but I am only giving 3 based on the clear facts of computer cheating... Yahtzee, be glad you got 3 stars from me... You need to fix this BS' ,

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

      'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'Too many ads. Devs are getting greedy with how many ads they put in, I got 3 before I even got to play. Don\'t bother with this junk.',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.',

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',

      'Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.',
       'I totally love this game, but there\'s always aye glitch and then it blanks out so I have to reinstall the app multiple of times so I could keep playing.. So maybe admin you could take a look at it for us please as I would totally love to keep playing this game as its a great game to play especially when your winning down after such along day.. Thanks',
       'It\'s a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it\'s way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we\'ve all waited way too long it\'s time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????',
       'People will tell you that it\'s good for your brain or that it\'s fun, but that really isn\'t true, especially since it won\'t even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can\'t even think for yourself and try it alone. It\'s annoying. Don\'t get it. Go to a different solitary game.',
       'I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you\'re hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn\'t even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I\'ll never download anything from these developers ever again.',
       'PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you\'re short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I\'m pretty sure others don\'t like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I\'m bedbound. Please...' ,

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'Not a bad game, but would be great if you could simply type the name down, instead of slowly searching for each individual letter. Makes it all sluggish and takes away the fluidity of the game.',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ,

      'I like this game but there\'s so much cheating going on. It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',

      'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Great game, I totally love it. I don\'t mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤',
       'It\'s fun. It\'s actually more informative that I thought it would be. It kind of opens up you mind and is an amazing pass time stimulate. However I feel it would be more beneficial in and educational sense if you had more of an opportunity to review the answer list through the app. It\'s actually something I look forward to when the round is over.  So you\'re not just learning something from what you and your challenger have contributed as far as answers, but the game itself has also done it\'s part. Other than that, totally awesome.',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

      'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'No really, if there were 100 stars this game and developer would get it! A word of warning....IT\'S ADDICTIVE!! if you ever reach the end of the game ( which is very doubtful) you might have to suffer "withdrawals" or you could play one of the other games...',
       'Really an exciting game. But there is a small problem. Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response. Hopefully you will fix this problem ASAP. Thanks!',
       'The arena levels are very hard to pass even though I have unlimited lives the leves become boring because you play and play and never pass. I believe they keep us in that level becuase there is no more levels. Really boring.',
       'This game is really fun to play. It is very addictive and cute. I get nervous & scared when I start losing because I don\'t spend any real money, and don\'t want to lose all my lives. I love playing it though.' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game, I love it. And with this new story mode update  I\'ve got more excited, I won all the starting races and now waiting for the refill. Only one thing that is negative, it is the upgrades are too much expensive and takes a huge time to gather coins versus the escalating events and this is depressing. I hope that game developers will fix this problem and make it fair enough.',
       'Munich update completely ruined what was previously the best driving experience on mobile. EDIT: Fall Out Boy update basically makes me unable to play the game altogether, with the game constantly freezing at the Gameloft splash screen. Talk about letting the junior devs do all the work unsupervised...',
       'This fallout boy update really sucks. Two stars for past glory but this needs fixed. Wont load multiplayer and takes several tries to launch the app at all. Either a white screen or gameloft logo hanging endlessly. And tbh I dont like the blurry nitro thing. I get it, but hope it goes away in the next update.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ,

      'This game is great, it\'s a lot of fun. Until it decides that you\'re not allowed to pass the loading screen.  Then there\'s the premium store. The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.',
       'Just perfect, the graphics are amazing especialy with IOS but in android is also extremely good. So OF COURSE i whould recomend it to someone to kill their time. Last but not least... i don\'t know, JUST DOWNLOAD IT I DONT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY!!!',
       'Made you play the game for 30 minutes before you can enter a promo code. Can\'t enter any promo codes in game, you have to make an account for their stupid website. None of the promo codes actually work. Clearly a marketing scheme just to get a bunch of downloads so they can get more money from investors. I say boo.' ,

       'Support sucks,,, repeatedly daily about my different profile and NOBODY fixes it OR GETS BACK TO YOU!!! GOT CHEATED OUT OF MY ORIGINAL MONEY AND CANT GET IN MY CLUB,,, ITS BEEN DAY 7,,,',
       'Connections are horrible. Dealer hits 21 after drawing 4 cards. Cant ever come back from a losing streak. The algorithms in this game are designed to make you lose. Infuriating game.',
       'Looks a lot manipulated. Best chance of all the card you need to come is to fold. If you got a pair, mostlikely another one got one too. Test it. Fold and I bet your cards will come especialy the low numbers. It sucks.',

      'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝',
       'Since the game is under process - it has a lot of room to improve. The studio is generous for the rewards and daily logins. They listen to the community and it takes time to fix those bumps. Love the game and the art also - unique and tasty! A competetive game that gives you urge to hustle more. Impressive game!   Been a butthurt person before - my apologies! Hope for the best!',
       'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!' ,

      'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ,

I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',

       'Help! Love this game, but I bought one of the larger spike balls, and after returning to the default ball for a while it won\'t let me use the spike ball without re-purchasing!',
       'Very addicting but after 310 gets boring due repetitive levels and  102&297 impossible to win.',
       'The challenge is awesome and I appreciate that you get the rubies you need to bust some layers. There are some really difficult levels. They\'re awesome.' ,

      'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can\'t win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!',
       'No way to begin the game without being decimated by cards I never see available to a new player.  Just geared toward getting me to spend money to HOPE to be able to learn and entice me to spend some cash.  Captive audience I guess..seemed fun but without spending money there is no way to battle other players to progress.   Even the quests are too hard to gain enough.  Just like WoW, which I couldn\'t keep up with monetarily for computer upgrades, good idea but not for the masses, only for the people without bills and responsibility.',
       'There\'s apparently no coming back to this game. If you stop playing for a bit and come back you\'ll never be able to catch up. I\'ve tried building decks but everyone playing has the best cards already and unless I buy card packs I\'ll never catch up.' ,

      'A great game and extremely addictive once you really get into it. Well thought out. It can be very time consuming but that is what makes it great. The grind to level up Heroes makes me want to come back and carry on, unlock other heroes and further upgrade my Kingdom. My only issue is the fact that resources are hardly able to be kept. Being under constant attack from other groups and unable to allow my Kingdoms walls to regenerate properly before I am able to move again seems to be a recurring issue and one I do feel needs to be looked at and tweaked. Nonetheless, I\'m impressed with the game. Continue with the good updates and this game could be one of the best mobile games out there.',
       'DON\'T PLAY THIS GAME.. THEY SCUM PPL!!.. They nothing more then thife..  I purchased hero from shop but didn\'t receive anything. I even did everything as they discribe in forum and try to contact with dev too but no one respond.. There are lots of player are like me who lost money and many of account disactive for no reason too..THIS GAME IS FULL OF GREEDY &SUCK!!.. ITS HUGE PAY TO WIN.  DON\'T INSTALL OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!',
       'All i see is language i cant understand from the chatting menu. Can you make an auto translattor so other people can understand each other. Even all the member of the house use chinese, brazilian, its better if all language translate according the language we choose in game from the option',
       'It was fun at first, but impossible to keep up with paying players.  I\'ve tried two different realms and was the same both times. If you\'re willing and able to cough up thousands of dollars to play a mobile, then this is your game.  Otherwise just pass it on by and find something else.',
       'Made for Chinese people only. Only 1 or 2 kingdoms are strong others are suffering Everytime. You will see all Chinese on top where ever you go. No chances of getting higher rank or position as it\'s under control of few players only. You can\'t make some special troops without a position of Duke or Prince.',
       'The game was pretty nice, all the ones who are speaking different kind of language they can as well translate, but there is one problem. I can\'t edit the message for the clan, i wonder if it is a bug or not. Once i became lord of a clan because a former lord turn me into a lord then he said to me to edit the message of the box. I tried to edit then it cannot edit, pls. fix this problem' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. It\'s so addictive and a really good game if your bored. I\'m really curious to find out what happens when you have collected all the balls, does the game just carry on or is their more challenges?? Overall, this game gets five stars from me 😚',
       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH   I love this game because it is exciting and addictive, it has easy controls and it is so many different colors as you move on and on! Try to beat the next high scores and HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS I DID' ,

      'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don\'t reach the end and fall into a void. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.',
       'Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn\'t respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn\'t know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn\'t be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.',
       'I\'ve been playing this app for a while now and up intil now I loved it but ever since the daily race-off challenge the game has been full of bugs. The daily race-off is a great idea but there are just too many bugs in it. I lose lives when I didn\'t even lose the race or I lose all my lives when I only lost one race.',
       'Game is good graphics are also good but it tends to get crash several times when I played it. I have a moto g5 plus phone with 4gb ram and adreno 508 GPU and all the games played very smoothly in my phone even asphalt 8 also ,i don\'t think so it\'s my phone who is not handling the game so there should be some bugs in this game  please fix as soon as possible.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.' ,

      'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

      'I\'m incredibly thankful for this game. Finally there is a game that is enjoyable, relaxing, calming and the best way to take my mind off of the worries all around us. Words cannot fully express what this game means to me! Thanks to the developers I look forward to playing everytime. The music is wonderful! I highly recommend this game. Thanks again ♡',
       'The latest update places advertising banners in the play area. You can\'t move them or play around them and I don\'t want to install the advertisement app.  They suck out loud.',
       'I absolutely love this game! It\'s not all that noisy kids stuff! I start my day off with my tea and M.J.! It\'s a great way to get the Brain up and running! 💜 I\'ve deleted the game 3 times. Alas, I just can\'t give up! Here I am again! And thoe I\'ve tried alot of other similar games, it\'s this one that is the most satisfying! 💜',
       'As much as I understand that you want to make a few bucks, the amount of advertising and the way the advertising is being presented has gradually become quite intrusive and annoying. I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read',
       'Not sure if you can play with friends or not because I love this game to keep my self challenged!',
       'Was a fun game until  after the recent update. Used to be able to close the ads, but now they just keep playing instead of closing. Will find a better version somewhere else.' ,

      'It is a good clicker game kinda like clicker heroes but with a lot better graphics, the controls are simple and the only thing I dislike about in the slightest way is that the heroes are a little bit to expensive, it has a simple but very cool design and deserves 5 stars. Thankfully it doesn\'t cost money to buy the game itself. All in all it is a great game.',
       'Great game still playing after 2 years and for people who ask what does prestige mean is that it gives you relics which are used to better you character with artifacts, but i come with a price... starting over with a slight headstart.',
       'was fun until the game stopped loading and I was forced to uninstall. thanks a f***ing lot too signed up with my email and it told me that my account is no longer valid. good game. ya d***heads.',
       'Pretty much fixes all my gripes with other rpg idle games, plus it looks really good. 1 day in, and I feel like even though I\'ve made a lot of progress, I still have more to discover. It\'s rare that an incremental like this actually captures that feeling. It\'s what makes me want to continue grinding.',
       'It\'s amazing, easy ,all you have to do is tap and upgrade your character and your allies and while your away and off your phone your allies could take down the titans for you. Super fun and addicting.',
       'Tried for a few minutes, then uninstalled. All I had to do is tap to kill the monsters, they don\'t even fight back. At lvl 2 or 3, I got a companion who auto attacked. Then I didn\'t even have to tap anymore. The monsters just died while I watched.  I don\'t understand why everyone is giving this 5 stars. Maybe some joke that the whole world gets except for me. Oh well.' ,

      'Game is very pleasant to look at, but it is basically a platform to watch advertisements on. And after a certain point, watching the advertisements don\'t offset the cost of opening your eggs. Smooth gameplay. Adorable graphics. But you\'ll be lucky to get maybe 10 minutes of gameplay per session before you have to wait. Not too bad if you only have a few minutes to play at a time, but not for me.',
       'The latest update deleted my save, and when I reloaded the one saved on the cloud, it only had my progress up to before Jurassic Island. Losing my stuff kind of took away the fun in playing for me, so I\'m uninstalling. It\'s too bad, I\'ve been enjoying the game for months.',
       'Just super cute time waster lots of adds but you find super cute things and I Love claw games so we\'re Good! I keep wining the super size 2x  your eggs but for some reason I can\'t get the ability to do that even though it says I won 3 times?',
       'I\'ve lost all my progress 😱 i\'ve lost everything:all my worlds including special events islands like Halloween and Valentines\', all toys and puzzles. I just opened it and it was showing me a tutorial. Signing in Google play account didn\'t help. What happened?? How do I fix it? I\'m so upset.. 😔',
       'Was a good pass time until the last update. For whatever reason, 2 eggs have been sitting hatched, however, when I click them they never open. They just continue bouncing up and down. Frustrating because now I can only hatch one egg at a time...',
       'Please get rid of the coin master demo ad.  It crashes my phone every time. Note that my phone can play any other demo ads fine.  I\'m fine watching a 30 sec video, not waiting for the app to restart several times. Will leave a bad rating until you fix this.' ,

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',
       'It\'s really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....',
       'It feels like I\'m playing a cpu, because the first cup is easy and my opponents only score very low points. I mean, I score 8-10 and my opposition have a hard time hitting the mark at all! (I\'ve repeatedly played it a handful of times.)',
       'Good  game when it works. Seems to run out your  time  and  freeze  up  when  you start  winning  to  much' ,

    description: 'Children\'s doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames',

It\'s fun af but I can\'t even play for a minute without the app stopping. Y\'all can download but 2 minutes from now ur gonna say "dang he told me so"',
       'Constantly force stopping. Cannot finish a game without the game closing on me.  Update: uninstalled and reinstalled game and did not fix the problem. Uninstalling until game is fixed. Other then that game has potential.  Update 2: after installing the game again, it finally worked. But now I\'m uninstalling the game for good.  After scoring over 7b points in 1 game, the game only gave me just over 2b points. Game is garbage. Do not download this game!',
       'The game is fixed so you can score more than 2.15 billion.  But you can bank anything over 2.15 billion still.  So I just wreck once I hit the 2.15.  About to uninstall unless the code is fixed to keep all the points you score.  Game is very addictive.',
       'Ok so there are two ways to fix the crashing and frequent ad problem. Simple way, just turn off your internet while playing. Second, disable the internet permission from app settings for permanent fix. No crash, no ads just a fun game. :-)',
       'In the last update you enabled the top score to go above 2.5 billion however the score to upgrade is still locked at 2.5 billion. My last game I scored 16 billion but I only had 2.5billion to spend on upgrades. Please fix',
       'Constantly crashes, makes it unplayable. I\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled and it still doesn\'t work. I have a note8 do am more than positive it\'s not the phone.' ,

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Pretty fun. But I don\'t think drivers or taxi drivers should drive like that, let alone be rewarded for hitting other cars like they do... Lol in the car it\'s cool but I wouldn\'t want to be physically in the game. It\'d hurt and be scary. Lol',
       'This is one of thee worse remakes of a classic I\'ve ever seen. To have a iconic game such as this and reduce it to a one tap game as oppose to actually driving and controlling the cab is ridiculous luckily it was free. So now I don\'t feel bad deleting it.',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'Great game, it\'s fun to play. Would rate it higher, but it often crashes when I\'m trying refuel or double my earnings by watching ads. Then the game restarts, and I can\'t refuel for awhile, or I list the bonus earnings. FRUSTRATING!!',
       'The game starts off really cool. At first I like the way the stunts are and the way you would have case only hit the camera with a vehicle. What gets really old is not being able to turn that off and happen to deal with it constantly with no way to turn it off. Unlocking drivers is annoying and takes forever. The in-game currency real money ratio is way disproportionate to what you actually get. It\'s a good game to play for a couple games but has no long-term fun' ,

      'I DONT LIKE THE UPDATE THAT GIVES YOU MORE TIME AFTER FORCE OF CARDS . IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WAYY!!!!! TO MUCH TIME TO COMPLETE THE BOARD. AND IT WAS MORE COMPETETIVE B4. I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I\'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging',
       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'The game was fun i paid for the full game, but after losing game after game because an army of 30 lost to an army of 4 or 5. Or it glitches and my whole army becomes the enemies, or someone turns into a computer and goes in an all out assult i get very frustrated. Risk is fun but so many glitches. Poorly run app with very little work given to it.',
       'This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',
       'Was fine for a couple weeks.... Then it started freezing up in the middle of my games.... All of them. I\'m using a LG V30+ with 128g ram so it\'s definitely not a lack of storage issue.   I wouldn\'t recommend this app to anyone who likes uninterrupted gameplay.',
       'I joined to get the one free game per day. Be aware, that if you do not subscribe (like me), the dice are loaded...  I actually had an army of 9 or 10 roll over against an army of 1 on quite a few occasions... statistically highly improbable.' ,

      'I love this game. I truly do. That\'s why this hurts. With the Adam Warlock update, I knew I had to be ready to save up crystals, though I did intend to spend a few for new uniforms, but hiding the one for the update\'s protagonist behind 5.5k crystals is a new low, and you haven\'t even soothed the slap on our faces from the Ultimates\' update. I was prepared to buy a new subscription for crystals or bios, but not anymore.  Netmarble, I thought you better than this. You had a good, committed following, yet you abuse us like this.',
       'An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn\'t thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that\'s what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can\'t get bored of it.',
       'Updates? Updating means improving something, you\'re just digging a bigger hole NM.. I used to spend £10 a month on this, now it\'s not even enough to unlock the new characters... Many of my free to play friends stopped playing, and I\'m 1 update of following them.. Just can\'t be bothered with the grind, and the other option is pumping money into it. That\'s not gonna happen anymore.',
       'Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don\'t already have this, stay away.',
       'Look I downloaded this game not too long after installation I expect to play the game then I was notified that I can\'t play offline no problem with that but my problem was downloading the update info which also cost 522.36 mb. All this should not b necessary I think it should be like this when downloading the game there should be an additional file which should be the update info.I feel it will be easy for those who are downloading this game (like me) to start the game instead of downloading "update info" before starting the game. And I hope make u of this advice because it will be beneficial for those who are downloading the game and for you.',
       'This game is fun and a great phone game. If you are looking for a game with leveling that will occupy time and love comic books this is the best. It has been plagued the last few updates with customer relation problems due to what has been viewed as cash grab maneuvers. The developers need to go back to what was making the game successful. The increasing of prices every few updates will destroy consumer confidence. I do feel that they listen to their customers and make adjustments accordingly.' ,

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ,

      'easy to pickup. The rewards are perfect and plenty.  It\'s not pay to win.  If you upgrade your runes enough you can defeat even people who are 5+ levels ahead of you. Rewards come often enough you aren\'t required to fork out a fortune to get anywhere. I can\'t wait until they open up new areas that are currently in development.',
       'I\'ve always liked the design of the different factions and creatures in the HOMM series of games, so it\'s nice to find a game which focuses more on them.  Graphics are great and the menus are easy to navigate. My only grievance is that the RNG aspects of the game can let you down more often than not, but it\'s not a deal-breaker for me. Awesome game, I definitely recommend giving it a try!',
       'As far as I can tell it\'s a summoners war rip off, same idea, pretty much same everything... But the graphics, they are awesome! Just hoping to get attached to this game and leave summoners, have being playing over too much time to still be the level I\'m right now, just proving that sw is purely pay to win with crazily low rng. If you guys keep getting the same ideas I think it will definitely be a great game. Plus any original ideas you guys have less the low rng please',
       'I liked that you are provided with a lot of free energy, it really helps to get into the game.  You can improve even weak monsters.  The monsters are interesting and will done, not sure why it\'s rated +17, my impression was that it was made for younger players.',
       'Great game, better than Summoners War. You also have control over your hero and he gets skill points.Pretty cool. I think summoners war people are giving this app 1* without any reason, pretty lame',
       'It\'s the best game out there! I am a true Heroes of might and magic fan who grew up with it and it shapes my childhood a lot. And I love this game. BUT - BIG ISSUE: Every hit sounds the same, and it\'s really annoyes me and it pulls down the battle quality a lot. Every hit shouldn\'t sound the same. They should all be different. Different sound for every type of hit. Now a big hit sounds the same as a small hit. Like the "pow" sound that comes every time you hit the enemy. So please fix that. Take example from Dungeon Boss! They have done it well! Dungeon Boss is legendary. And they have made the hits all sound different. And ANOTHER ISSUE: the menu music sounds like you\'re watching The Bold and the Beautiful, like this cringy soap opera on TV. How can you put music like that in the game? I don\'t want to feel like I\'m listening to music from The Bold and the Beautiful the whole time I\'m playing. It\'s really annoying. Thanks for a great game anyway! :) Much love!' ,

      'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

      'I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the "mine" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it\'s nicely done!',
       'I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.',
       'Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it\'s just my phone. Also I\'m not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)',
       'Overall the app is really great. It\'s the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you\'re not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.',
       'One of my favorite games ever!  I am glad to see it available for my phone!!!  However:  I do not like the constant switching between marking a flag and clearing a space, because I keep blowing up mines I am trying to mark, from being in the wrong mode.  A tutorial to explain the settings and the flag/clear switch would be nice.  Using a long press to flag a space and a tap to clear it would be even better.  I would like to be able to set the bomb number myself.',
       'While this certainly is minesweeper, there are some serious design flaws. First off, when you click the first cell the board does not seem to generate around that, meaning that 80% of games on medium you will loose randomly opening squares trying to get a start. Hard mode is literally unplayable, as the mines are so dense it turns into a guessing game. There are better minesweeper apps out there.' ,

I love it because it forces my mind to think many moves ahead. Be careful: it\'s highly addictive!',

      'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Typical pay for play. Fun in the low levels then it becomes painfully obvious who are paying the big bucks. They will say everything can be obtained for free. While this is true. The amount of time and effort makes it not worth the hassle. To get the better robots you will pay a lot of money. $100 for a robot as a sale price in this game. It shuts off in the middle of the game tech support took their time responding and didn\'t address the problem. They say record and take pictures but they will not upload. In my opinion not worth the time.',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points',
       'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it' ,

      'They really just want your money. Can\'t try on multiple things at the same time, Rewards are pathetic for the challenge requirements being so high, levelling up takes ages , definitely not beginner friendly. Pretty to look at gets boring really quickly and can\'t be moved to SD storage, overall it gets more frustrating as you realise you can\'t afford anything and can\'t enter challenges.',
       'Im simply addicted to the game and i usually play like 5 times a day and i would\'ve happily gave it a 5 stars if i could vote. I ALWAYS get the error message "there was a problem communicating with the network". I contacted the support team several times but its useless so until i can vote normally i wont be satisfied',
       'I really like this game, but it does end up costing a lot of real money if you want to make progress. And it can make you feel bad if you are voted poorly and lose points all the time.',
       'I am not into fashion, but I really do enjoy this game. My problem with the game however, is that at some point you would need to put real money into the game to continue on. It\'s hard to get four or five stars on your challenges if you don\'t purchase new items. When it comes to voting, you might be a level 3 competing against a level 58. It\'s a little unfair because higher levels have been playing longer, they have more of a collection, and therefore usually get the votes.',
       'The game is fun, but once you reach a certain point, you either need to spend your own money on diamonds to progress or you come to a complete standstill. Not worth it. Also, the challenges give you bonuses for staying in season. Once that season is over, you lose the bonus, so if you acquire a large wardrobe, it\'s pretty much obsolete after that season is over. You also get bonuses for borrowing items from friends. The whole system is based on other people voting on your design so basically you\'re designing your model based on peoples interpretation of the challenge, not the actual description of the challenge. If you\'re friendless, penniless, and interpret the challenges literally, this game is not for you.',
       'Love the game and beautiful clothes. Find it to be rather expensive. Am I the only one getting kicked out repeatedly? Between glitches and cost, this is sadly one I may have to delete' ,

      'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it\'s not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?',
       'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.' ,

       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',

      'I didn\'t hold out much hope initially but it\'s a fabulous game. Graphics are good, there\'s a story and multiple maps etc. Its easy to progress and the special event maps were hilarious.  Definitely suitable for the majority of players and even young ones. There\'s no gore or unsuitable scenes and no constant push to buy ingame content. I wish more game developers thought like this. Properly enjoyable',
       'Great game, incredible customer service. You will never get bored with this game. Play daily as much or as little as you want. There are seasonal (timed) events to play and ongoing daily (no time limit)searches. We have all been there, missed an achievement because we logged on 10 minutes late. NO MONEY has to be spent to truely enjoy this game. Your progress or fun level isn\'t held hostage if you don\'t want to pay to play. Customer service is incredible. I was stuck and the response was quick and helpful. Even when I still didn\'t get it, think if it was a snake, it would have bitten me, they helped and never made me feel stupid. Install NOW and start having fun.',
       'Energy is spent too quickly, kind of their way of trying to make you to buy gems. I get it, and I would buy them if they weren\'t so expensive! I can barely make it through a single task, it does get quite annoying.   Maybe give us the option of watching ads for gems or extra energy, and an ad free option with minimal cost so those who would rather not have the ads get to benefit too?',
       'Love the challenge,  the mini puzzles.  The only draw back I would say.  As a new player having enough energy to complete some of the old challenges example (Valentine\'s 2017) is almost impossible.  Would love to figure out how to gain more energy. Fan page as far as I can see does not help on this.  Other then  that very enjoyable game.',
       'The only thing that would really improve this game is if you have a multi-tile selection upgrade. That would allow you to select multiple spots to dig, they would still Dig one at a time in the order of which they were selected. If they are blocked in you would have to select the tiles in order as they would become accessible.',
       'I didn\'t think I was going to enjoy this game as much as I am. I thought it was going to be something I played once in a while, just to pass the time. Next thing I know, I\'m playing this game more often than the major MMORPG I\'m currently playing. If you want a seriously addictive game with mild brain teasers/puzzles, then I highly recommend this game!' ,

      'Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.',
       'Way too many ads after every time I lose or go onto another level an advert pops up. Verry annoying. But the gameplay is decent.',
       'I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!',
       'You know what i love this game and people say theres to many ads i egree but i found out a hack just put your phone on flight mode and then  there will be no ads try it if you don\'t believe me',
       'This game should be called, "cut the ads".  Unable to play the game due to excessive ads so I had to delete it soon after downloading. Sad I know. First world problem.',

       'The amount of ads is ridiculous! Especially from that "Tune Blast", it\'s really annoying. And, w/some of the ads you have to wait 30sec before they\'re done, there\'s no "x" button. The actual mahjong game itself is decent.',

       'It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down.',

      'InstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (TVCD) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. VEarn points equals vac instead of like some of the others where it takes Toyo points to reach mac etc...Also, InstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TVCD) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Bankk. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'All of all the badminton game i\'ve played, this is the best. I love the graphic, the gameplay and all. But the rank, -50 when we lose is just too much. And the price of the equipment and ability is just too expensive. Especially because we only got like 12xp and 82$ when we win a game, its doesnt match with the those expensive things. So i hope you\'ll change something about this whole rank decreasing, the xp and the coins that we get if we win a game. Thank you :)',
       'decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.',
       'The game is very addictive and congrats to the creater of the game  I loved it too much than any other games.................. This is the he only game I had played for a little long time........... But the prices for the equipments is too big.......... They have to reduce this....... Those who read review this about the game just download it immediately You will be addict to it..........',
       'Amazing badminton game! The game mechanics are perfectly balanced, easy to learn and harder to master. Skill becomes a huge factor when playing against unbalanced opponents. No single play works against everyone challenging you to constantly change up your play style. Just love this game!' ,

      'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw "pick 2" vs. pick 3. I\'m a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the "typical pick 3 concept"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper',
       'This is my second time playing it! I have already played it to the very end do I took a break and am back at it!!',
       'Love love love this game. Ty for making it as it is. It\'s not hard like the rest but it holds you. It great to take your mind off life and you don\'t gotta think of anything. Great game on level 300 and my so is on like 430. Way to go.' ,

      'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',
       'Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...' ,

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',

       'Simply the BEST city building & city management game on the PlayStore.  It\'s great fun and many things to build and do.. Weekly events to keep you occupied. City management so you need to actually think before you do. (Example, don\'t build sewers near suburbs or inner-city) Beautiful graphics, plenty of various types of buildings, leveling and so much more.  Love it.' ,

Logged back in to Dragon City through Google games and guess what it has reset my acvount. I was level 17 and now I have had to start again from level 1. But when checking achievements all my achievements from my original account are all there. WHERE HAS MY ORIGINAL ACCOUNT GONE. Wil give 5 stars if this is fixed...',
       'Love this game so much. I can\'t put it down for to long. My son also loves it too. This would be alot better if i could do what i need to on my islands but cant. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3-4 times and the dame thing happens like nothing loads',
       'Where is support? I have gem confirmation enabled but it\'s just taken 70 gems without warning. I\'ve also done extras to win gems but they haven\'t been added. There needs to be a cancel button like on food etc. Need to say time it will take to hatch eggs etc. When doing challenges it should say exactly what you need to do and spend so you aren\'t guessing. Besides these issues, I am really enjoying this game. It\'s easy and fun. I just wish you didn\'t need to spend so much to get further in the game.' ,

      'The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'Game is really good. Best drift game I\'ve ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn\'t finish the race and it gives the "wrong way" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.' ,

      'I play real poker and do pretty well. This game is clearly made to force you to lose your chips and buy chips. They are obvious bots, and the amount of time I have a great hand on a turned and get called by absolutely  nothing but lose on the river is just unreal. I understand it happens, but it happens way too often in this. I have spent alot of real money on thia game in the past, and now I just remembered why I actually stopped playing it',
       'I would like the game very much never had to spend it on time kind of addictive. I can figure the game out sometimes very easily other times not. You can usually tell whether you\'re going to be lucky (those are the times to hit the slot machine while you\'re playing). Sometimes the hardest part e dealing with it dummies who think it\'s bingo. And sometimes I got to admit how you had enough time and I\'ll play that way too but that\'s usually when the game teaches you a lesson at other times it\'s very predictable and I know that I\'m going to get that hand but it\'s fun',
       'Fun game. Most of what I know about this game, I\'ve actually learned by playing it on this app. And yes, it\'s very addictive!! And yes, anyone with negative comments???...they haven\'t taken the time to REALLY know & learn the game & it\'s rules. Just because ya lose...doesn\'t make it a bad game!! LEARN THE GAME & ITS RULES, SPEND A LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY PLAYING, (WITH GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP)...AND YOU\'LL LOVE IT. The more ya play, the better it gets!!',
       'More ad pushes and Facebook posting than anything I\'ve over downloaded. Posts without asking and you can\'t play a single game without 20 notifications asking you to spend money or share it with friends. Popular game but can\'t do anything for 10 minutes after opening app until you sift through all the nonsense they throw at you.',
       'There\'s a small bug - once you lost all your money in a tournament, you can\'t see the cards of the other opponents after the show down... Besides that, the app is perfect. I wish I could have this interface in real life games.',
       'Finally just going to uninstall.  With these bugged gifts that\'s just it.  Spun all my chips too 0 and I\'m done.  Though they say it is random some hands just feel like a suck out. Also even though it\'s not the dev to be at fault there are just too many bad players on every table that just makes it so any form of strategy or playing is pointless.' ,

      'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!',
       'You know,  its a shame because this is a fantastic game. There is ZERO balancing. The entire game is designed to force you into using gems and micro transactions to get past abnormally difficult gameplay walls.',
       'It\'s nice how you\'ve mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn\'t expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!' ,

      'This game is ok. The graphics are good. It\'s my favourite bowling game out there.  However I really don\'t know why this needs access to my phone contacts and other permissions.  As a result it\'s been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it\'s not required I\'m not installing it. Other than that complaint it\'s actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.',

      'I love these games, really, and I was on a roll, but I can\'t get pass level 48 because my Wiko LENNY3 touch screen isn\'t responsive enough to register both fingertips at the same time. EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can\'t wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.',
       'This game and yellow have single handedly improved my relationship with my niece. She loves playing these games over and over every time she comes to visit. Christmas day she didn\'t want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.',
       'Brilliant follow-up to YELLOW! ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! And, there ARE games trying to pretend that they\'re the same...only Bart Bonte does it right!  I try not to let myself do too many levels at once, just so I can extend the game. I can\'t wait for the next color!',
       'By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another "Yellow 2", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)',
       'Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I\'m familiar with Bart\'s mind by now. &lt;3 I think it\'s great that clues are available though and that they don\'t give everything away right away. It\'s a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!',
       'Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bart Bonte! I\'ve been waiting for a very, very long time for this game to come out since I first played "Yellow". Thanks a lot! But here are a few other questions I have for you: what will be the next game? How long will I have to wait until the next game comes out? Could you at least give me a hint? Thanks!' ,

      'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn\'t take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.',
       'Its a cool game. If you press the hint button it gives you a choice to watch a ad for help. I am not seeing in-app purchases so far and I have had this game for a while! I recommend this but not the other version. It gets a tiny bit boring after a while though. overall, GREAT GAME! Whoever made this game is great! :) :) :)' ,

This game says it isn\'t looking for personal data but it is. It\'s not safe and it wants to learn more about people. I don\'t trust this game! Also if someone mentions \'Dr.Wallace" ask them who it is and then you will see what I mean.',

      'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',
       'Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn\'t notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile',
       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brain😀 anyway superr game excellent',
       'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'This game is challenging. I was so addicted I wanted to se what would happen if I got up to 4096.  Well ai did and it actually worked! I even have a screen shot. Fun!',
       'I\'ve been having issues with this app for months, where it will sometimes act as if it received multiple inputs in rapid succession. This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I\'m playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I\'ve gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018' ,

      'Had I read the reviews,  I probably would\'ve  second guessed getting the game. However, the gameplay is very different, its really interesting,  and highly addictive.  Despite people saying its a pay to win,  it is not. Its actually pretty fair as long as you can keep up with it. I have yet to pay a cent in this game and have advanced just as fast and even have better and higher level birds than many that ive seen.  Hands down my favorite game ever.  The events are also a plus plus because they give you a good amount of rewards.',
       'Great in a new twist with more directives and challenges as well as strategy. Downside is costs and rates of h9w much gold is found leaves inclinations to be geared toward in app purchases or a lot of waiting time in between. Nice update would be to ease the cost of leveling birds and adjust the amount of gold found daily and for battles to equal out the waiting for scouts and such.',
       'The game so fresh and really fun but honestly.. the screen sometimes hang or stuck suddenly while I\'m playing it, it\'s not caused my phone or internet connection, I\'ve tried with different phone and the result is similar.. and I have high spec phone 2gb ram, 32gb rom, cpu 1,25 ghz and 4g line.. make it better and better again cause I love to play it without hang screen, for now I only give u 3 stars',
       'Used to be beyond awesome. Beware before playing this game... There are great rewards but it costs money and there is no guarantee of getting the rewards. It\'s the luck of the draw... Plus you are forced to play against stronger players, and therefore struggle to progress in the game. I used to love this game... You have been warned.',
       'The game itself is really fun but I despise the gambling form of monetization. I realize there needs to be a way to finance development, but just because it\'s widely used doesn\'t make it right. Let me buy the birds I want instead of relying on luck and I amp up the  rating.',
       'You can\'t get any of the top rewards unless you pay for them. And then you still don\'t get them if you don\'t pay enough.  Last series required up to $150 for the top prize... new series every few weeks.  Great game,  but frustrating if you don\'t want to open your wallet. I can\'t  afford it... uninstalling' ,

      'This game is dope I play it all the time! Alot of ads but I may just pay the 3 bucks to remove them. Only thing I would request is maybe an option to view the race stats at the end of each race. to see who we raced and their times rather than just a quick glance. So say I beat a high ranked player I\'d like something to show for it. Besides that I love this game!',
       'This game was worth 5 stars until the updates... More than half the time i try to connect to a race its doesn\'t work and doesn\'t give me back the 20 energy it requires to race. Also, I watched 50 videos to get the new car BLADE and i received absolutely NOTHING!!!! Until they fix this issue its getting a 1 star from me.',
       'Still a lot of problems with the game even after the update. Nothing like watching colours go by as my race finishes. Somehow manage to watch the "crowd" most races. Hate finishing 1st and getting 3 medals in events, then finishing last to pickup 400+ a game designed for awful gamers',
       'Lately the game says searching for players but the game goes back to home screen does not give my fuel back... i would say it was a fluke but it happens all the time. Resets twice keeps my fuel then it works. NO IT IS NOT A DROPPED NETWORK PROBLEM.. ITS YOUR GAME NOT FINDING PLAYERS AND STEALING MY FUEL TO MAKE ME BUY MORE',
       'So first of all way too many ads... When you click race you get Frozen and then sent to home screen and you lose your fuel... When you\'re "waiting on players" and they don\'t show up you lose fuel.. out of 10 attempts to start a race I play one',
       'I really like this game when it actually lets you play it. It has so many connection issues that most the time it wont let you race it just takes your fuel and kicks you back to the main screen. Very frustrating' ,

      'Amazing addictive game. Try it out! Not too many ads, and just the right amount of challenge without pulling your hair out. Sometimes there\'s a hidden dot in the title, or ones that are almost the same color as the background, but it\'s not bad enough to lose a star.',
       'Updated with no fix...  problem still persists.  No exit button and controls for the back button are very wonky. Need to add dedicated exit button or fix what happens when you tap / swipe the blank park of the screen. Trying to bring the controls up from their hidden state selects options is frustrating. You end up starting games. Very unpolished controls, imo.',
       'Cool game, only bad thing is that tutorial levels are rated as bronze so you can never have all gold.. I tried doing the same tutorial three times in a row, then it is counted as gold, but when you exit the game and enter again that it is bronze again',
       'Interesting puzzle type game.  Using rope is a bit challenging on small screens.  It used way too much background data which is not have related at all.  My phone gets hot when using the app.  Uninstalling',
       'Different and fun. Not too hard but still challenging.  Daily challenges are impossible to complete though (bug?) , so don\'t bother with them (hence my only giving 3 stars)',
       'This right here is a work of genius.  My only wish is for an undo button, for when you accidentally touch a part of the screen and it places a spot/cut/bridge in an unwinnable spot.  Especially annoying during daily challenge that you can\'t re-do.  Also, I would like to be able to retry any level, such as the daily or randoms, even if it wouldn\'t "count". I\'m convinced every so often there is an unwinable level, but you can\'t even test it or let the devs know because once you fail it goes away permanently.  Still, a great, great game... I really hope there is a V2 some day.' ,

      'PRACTICALLY AMAZING!!!!! THE BESTEST COCO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!! I have played many coco games, (almost all of them) but this one is the bestest of them all (if that\'s a word 😜) mainly because A LOT is unlocked including the SPA!!! (Crazy, right?!?!?!) and there are so many things to do. Plus it also reminds me of subway surfers..... The one thing I love besides the spa, is the restaurant. As far as I know, only fitness girl has that..... So definetly, it\'s a plus..... 👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍😋',

      'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊',
       'Game is great, but when you lose all your lives it takes some minutes for you to be able to play again, or you can buy the pro version but who wants that? I just wanted to play whenever I wanted to without paying extra for it... You maybe could allow us to play without achieving anything without the need for lives...' ,

      'This so freaking awesome, a woo hoo maker! I kept mumbling awesome, awesome, when i passed a car. And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... 😥😣😈👹',
       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'I can\'t stop playing this!! The missions are really hard and thats what makes it fun! although i almost threw my phone twice. but this game is amazing! the graphic is good too!' ,

      'I think it\'s a very fun game. But only thing I would like to see is maybe a market where you could put up duplicates for a price rather than having to trade with 25 million people just to find someone who is willing to buy. It kinda gets annoying when you\'re trying to sell some duplicates and all you find are cheap people who waste time. Also, there should be more packs being released because of how many cards there are. It\'s just too hard to find a card you\'re looking for, through trading. Secondly, if the market idea doesn\'t work there should be an option in which you can talk with the trader and/or be able to set a price of the duplicate you\'re trying to sell rather than wait for people to make unreasonable offers.',

       'Please add draft builder challenges to android. Also please add a new trading system so people on android can trade with people on Apple. Then it would be worth 5 stars.',
       'Would have been 5 but there isn\'t any news about DBC for android and regular lightening rounds have not happened. Plus an open all packs button would be helpful.',

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'GREAT!... but the coins are a bit hard 2 earn thought the game is very addictive and the adds are not very frequent but they do appear on the bottom of your screen while playing thought there is a no adds purchase also the only purchase in the game the thing I like about the no adds purchase is that sometimes it will let you get it for 50% off so it is only one dollar instead of $2 (USD). The game has a lot of pens and I so far have unlocked a bit more than half and have played the game a lot of the game. But really needs an update.',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn\'t have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What\'s bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.' ,

I still like game though I just hope u add that',
       'UNINSTALED   Need alot of gold (money to get it) to finish special even its true...!!! you can\'t finished that even if don\'t have it. yes it\'s a MONEY MAKING GAME..!!! actually, it\'s pretty good game but you need to improve your server, it\'s fu**ng so long... need 5 minutes to enter the game. please even if  I got a good internet, still to long long time to enter the game. please​ fix it up.',
       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add.

       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.' ,

      'An interesting game, it gives the planes a slightly paper feel when viewing them. However, the actual controls are smooth although they can be slightly twitchy at times. The addition of game modes recently was a welcome change to the game and has helped me through many hours of boredom. This game overall is very good and I advise you download it.',
       'Last update killed it. Can\'t even see the bottom row to select anything. It\'s covered by an ad and the aircraft selection covers it as well and won\'t go away. Makes it unplayable.',
       'Way to many adds and when I paid to remove them they were still there. Tried to contact them and they never replied. Had to get a refund through Google play. Don\'t waste your time with this app.',
       'Hate this app because of too many advertisement. The game is good but too many advertisment make it worst cant play much because of it. Google play you should work on the advertisment.',

I mutter to the screen \'why does she need a rug, when she\'s already got the carpet?!\' and I just need one more star to get the rug and the level is, argh, impossible without spending real money which I haven\'t got. And yet I keep on coming back to waste 5 more lives ... Oh well, patience is a virtue.',
       'It\'s an ok game but if you want to not be stuck on boards for a long time as you advance you have to spend money...they give tiny bits of coins or other needed tools for free so this game is very slow and can become quite boring.',

      'I am not sure that having umpteen levels is really such a good thing. Once you have done the first 20 they all feel the same. Given how easy they are I would have wanted a timer to add some challenge to it. Also, while I fully understand that devs need to get paid, this game has way too many ads for enjoyment',
       'Great game. Fun way to pass the time. My only issue is with the ad placement. When the banner pops up, it blocks the controls at the bottom of the screen, so i can\'t restart or select a different puzzle.',

       'TOO MANY ADS. Reading the reviews, this has been the main complaint about this game for several years and nothing has been done with cutting back the ads. Literally half the time spent on this game is waiting for the ads.',
       'Puzzles become repetitive.... but still difficulty to solve in less moves than it took last time!! Also, my progress didn\'t transfer when I switched phones.... Which meant a lot more playing than initially anticipated' ,

      'Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.',
       'This is a fun game however it allows people to cheat or it\'s rigged. It\'s no coincidence that the better I play the better my opponent plays. I think half the time we are playing a rigged computer. I spent $50 on this app in a week and I am deleting it now. Sorry crooked people that run this app.',
       'I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?' ,

      'Okay game. As a musician of multiple instrements, I can say that this game requires no musical talent. It is just a tap fast game. But if you like games like guitar hero from the 2000\'s only without the weird hippies and nicer music, then this is the game for you. In my opinion the game is okay, not very interesting but a definite time burner. To many ads but if you dont mins that, then its fine.',
       'This game is rubbish I would not recommend this to anyone with a Samsung. It flashes black, and makes my phone freeze. Don\'t get it',
       'I really like this game and the songs. There are some glitch\'s like when your playing it will go to an AD half way through the song and tou lose all the rhythm you have gotten, if they could sort this out then it would be a fantastic game.',
       'the game is awesome i loved it but  i want one change that is please give the feature of recording it would be a great game with recording function yet it is best piano game I love it so much some levels are quite hard and some are quite easy but still its an awesome game please download it if you love songs and piano😍😍😍😘😘😗😗😙😎😎😎😋😋😀😀😀😀😚😚😚😙😙😘😘🤘👌👌👌👍👍👍👄👄💋💋',
       'I will give it a five star rating if there weren\'t as many ads because after every song there is an ad, which shows down my phone. Plz fix it because its an awesome game its just the ads❤',
       'I don\'t like this game at all because at the tournament adults and teens are playing and I\'m just a kid so it\'s impossible to beat the elder ones well I might not be able to beat them but I can put smart them by turning up tye heat which means time to go to top speed!' ,

      'PLEASE HELP,  my pet is somehow stuck & I can\'t get him free. Makes it harder not being able to move paths or his home whiles he\'s out or I could get him unstuck.   Please make an update where you can move these things while pets are out, or get my pet unstuck for me. Otherwise I won\'t be able to continue the game due the the inconvenience it\'s making.   (other then that the game is real fun & would like to continue it.)',
       'Love the game, easy to understand and they have videos on how to use the equipment and make ur farm expand. Also, their customer service is great!!  Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'The game used to be good but it has been hanging up repeatedly with the recent updates. Open a treasure chest/daily chest to get a reward will forever be loading and not running. Have to shut down the whole game and redo the quests again. Auto-save for the game had also been unstable, with us having to redo the stuff that we have done previously. It\'s very frustrating given that we have planted some crops and only to realise that the crops we had planted were not actually planted when we revisit the farm to harvest those crops.',
       'This was my favorite game but lately it has so many problems. Things I\'ve completed keep DISSAPPERING and I have to keep redoing them to move on in the game. I\'ve been asking for help for a few months now. Also there are tons and tons of issues with the game crashing. I\'ve done everything to fix this that I was told to do yet nothing is working. As for contacting the link sent to the reply to this I\'ve also done that a few times now with no help. I\'ve been using the in game help tab and keep getting told its been sent to another help team. I\'ve spent Way too much real money on this game and if not fixed soon will want it all back and the deleting the game.   Please fix this so once again I can give it 5 stars. Since the last update the game is now closing in it\'s own. This is very frustrating. So again as I\'ve asked above please fix this .',
       'It\'s hard to progress in the game without enough RC (Ranch Cash) so I\'m basically stuck with the same quests for some time now. Not worth playing if you don\'t have it for the required items and you have to pay for more RC.' ,

      'I absolutely love love LOVE this game. Im no bot i swear. This game is so addictive. Gameplay is great. A few suggestions however. Sometimes i find my "sword" just going right through some fish, and it doesnt kill them. Also, maybe switch up some ways to get Stars. I find myself saving so much to get the 99k sword fish and never buy any other fishes. I feel like the players should work their way up slowly and not have to play with only the "daily reward" fishes. Just my suggestion  Thank you guys!',
       'This game is really fun  and addicting but it cud use something lyk ince uve unlicked all the arenas there shud be something to use the trophies for lyk to win an epic new fish or something',
       'Addicting, Fun, Thrilling. It\'s absolutely a game you have to try. It\'s way fun, and a little competition never hurt anything, right? Keeps you on the top of your toes, or on the couch with your eyes glued to the screen.',

      'You\'re just plain fun! You really understand the right amount of challenge to keep it fun but not aggravating. Have to admit I did use some hints. May I make a teeny weeny suggestion. Make a link at end to "rate the game," I wanted to, looked around, in end clicked link to play red then find yellow to do this rating... that\'s cuz I like yah... thanks for the smile!',
       'This is as simple as it can be, yet perfect in every way. Relaxing music that doesn\'t distract you from your game, smooth gameplay, easy controls. I liked the fact that you are tossed into the game without any tutorials, left on your own. I am not really into puzzle games but I completed this game in a single afternoon and it had me asking for more.',
       'It\'s so captivating I finished it in a single morning! I love how challenging the puzzles are at the same time they are fun. The level 49 made me go crazy because I couldn\'t get it right, I had to draw the squares  so I wouldn\'t press the wrong one. I totally loved it and I\'m so going to download red!',
       'I love Bonte  games. As always, beautiful graphics and just the right level of difficulty. Looking forward to the next one. Thanks Bart. I just have to edit this to add that I don\'t understand why people are complaining about ads. You only need to watch them for a hint, and only briefly. It\'s a free game, and the developer has to make a living. You can pay to get them removed, but they really aren\'t obtrusive at all.',
       'To be honest, I was like this is going to be boring 💤, but within minutes, I was totally hooked. Absolutely amazing, love it. If fact, I went straight back online and got red. I\'ve not heard of this Bart Bonte before, but he\'s a bit magic.',
       'The color... Only yellow..its just yellow!! I\'ve played this game once amd its taken over my life. My bedroom walls were once blue..now all I see is yellow! My red hair is yellow, my brown cat is yellow.. Everything IS YELLOW. As I sink further into the eternal abyss of yellow, I can only scream. God has abandoned this app.. God save us all' ,

I\'m hoping there\'s a way to increase this later in the game. Overall though, the game is pretty generous with currency, so I don\'t think I\'ve ever ran into a hard building wall that made me think I had to spend money on it to progress further.

       'Freezes usually when watching ads. Or you can\'t exit ads there is no X. Like everyone else is saying it actually cost alot of real money if you want to really play. I miss the days when you can pay for a game and then pay for expansion packs. But no.... Games now days are money pits and I\'m not falling in. But it\'s a pretty fun game, just takes forever to do anything. They should also always give you a option to use in game money instead of in game coins.',
       'The game was very fun. I even spent quite a bit of money to get told bars so I could progress but now I\'ve got to the point where there\'s nothing to do except repeatedly go to auctions without any objective. Please update soon so I can feel my money isn\'t wasted',
       'The game moves too slow. The rewards are not big enough for the real money and getting one gold per ad is not enough. From the moment you begin the game until day forever it\'s just too slow to have fun. Double the speed and charge a dollar or 2 and you\'ll make the millions you want. Just make it fun instead of sludge. I\'ll pay you ten bucks to open it all up with no ads if you\'d just make it fun',
       'Would have left my rating at 5 but they kept asking me to rate it over and over again. Many spelling and grammar mistakes, can only level up by completing missions and facts about products are not accurate. Fun game, but needs work. Can only play for 10 minutes at a time before you need it wait on cooldowns and more energy for levels.',
       'I only downloaded this game yesterday but I\'m addicted to it already. As with all games there are a few little things that annoy me but overall it\'s definitely worth playing. Would recommend to anyone who just looking to pass some time' ,

      'This game has highly disappointed me.  It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won\'t ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn\'t do any good either. They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don\'t waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn\'t it.',
       'DO NOT DOWNLOAD CAN NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A BUG!!!!!!  After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!',
       'It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.I tried  to complete many offers such as surveys, installing a playing another game for certain level, but this game never unlocked no matter what! They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.',
       'On a serious note, you need to give me this game for free. I downloaded and played two different games to get the game for free and 5 hours later I still don\'t have the full game. I\'ve had to install 5 different games just to get this one for free and I STILL don\'t have the full game. I\'m not impressed!!!',
       'Game is ok.  Tasks are sometimes unclear.  After a few tasks you have to pay to keep going or complete some offer.  Tried several times, but never lets me continue.  Should say it\'s a trial version in description.  No clue how it got a 4+ star rating.',
       'Game would have been ok, however I got to a point where you have to either complete an offer or pay to continue with the game. I completed 2 separate offers and was still unable to continue the game, after which I contacted someone about this several days ago and have yet to hear back or be able to continue with game, very dissatisfied. Horrible customer service.' ,

      'The original sonic dash is better imo. had a better atmosphere, maps looks better gameplay also better. the original was a masterpiece. also, I don\'t like that they introduce scenes that requires you to tilt your phone. since i played sonic dash i didn\'t expect it to be there. it\'s annoying when you\'re laying down and play the game and you got that scene just ruins the gameplay.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they\'re back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.',

       'I\'m addicted to this game.  You don\'t have to spend money to enjoy it either.  Illustrated beautifully and I love the fact items move around plus also have different modes to keep you intrigued. I only find it frustrating not having enough energy to keep seeking',
       'Very good game and beautifully designed. Nice combination of seeking games and other puzzles and great looking locations. Would give a 5 rating but for 2 things; 1. Happy to spend a bit of cash now and then, but being constantly spammed to buy stuff spoils the game ( and makes me reluctant to part with my cash) 2. Really annoying to have to explore locations multiple times (up to 20 times) to get it into the right "mode". There are tools to do this, but they can\'t be targeted so are almost completely useless.',
       'Glitches in Haunted Lights & Treasure Box where game play freezes for approx 10 seconds but timer continues counting down so cannot make enough moves in the allotted time to complete the puzzle. Very annoying as it spoils what is otherwise a thoroughly encapsulating game! :-(',
       'Really like this game, although some parts are not made very clear. I don\'t understand parts of it, but I\'m getting there. And it\'s a but clunky but maybe that\'s because I\'m on my tablet. As with all games, not enough, or big enough, rewards!',
       'I really enjoyed this game but same problem as someone else since you have updated it it just says waiting for WiFi. I had problems when you updated it before and in the end had a new phone started again and now this problem. Why does problems happen when you do and update. I have got to a good level again and I really don\'t want to start again. It\'s a shame as I really think this is or was the best game I\'ve played.  Please sort it' ,

I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',

Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s                    "AD\'S!!!".... But i did like the game when I played it',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.' ,

      'I hate it! There is only three looks to do, and the make up! Literally you have to click on it a thousand times until you get the one you like. The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',
       'I gave you 4/5 star\'s, if you make a second version then i will install it again and play it then make it 5/5 star\'s, if not i will move on to more dress up game\'s and other types of games',
       'Really! you could only do their makeup and dress them up! BORING! Hmmph!',
       'this is a good game. even if you only have three looks it is still fun to make up different looks each time you play. invent and try out new styles x',

      'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'OK, this word game is the bomb! It actually uses words that I know! I have played so many word games that use strange words and won\'t take common words! Thank you, WePlay! I will be trying your other games and telling my friends about them!',
       'I turned off the notifications on this game and it still gives me pop ups that cover up anything else I\'m doing including navigation instructions while I\'m driving.  This is dangerous and unacceptable.  I can\'t be fiddling with a game while I\'m driving in a whiteout blizzard in the middle of the night.  Uninstall.' ,

      'Since yesterday when I tried to play it won\'t start from main screen. It said to touch to start, but how many times ever I touched the screen, it wont start. I though there is someting wron with my touch screen, but my touch screen works fine! I have maid scash purchase last night and I am not being able to play!! Please do something!',
       'Great game both as a concept and its graphics. The only problem is the lack of energy. You only have energy for like 6-7 battles and then you have to wait or use gold. Make it at least 10 battles at low levels and keep increasing it.',
       'Energy goes way too fast. You can spend it all in a matter of a few minutes. Rewards feel miniscule compared to other games. Grenade recharge is too long when early missions require it for objectives. Game has potential but I can\'t recommend it right now as it barely qualifies as playable when energy depletes so fast',
       'I had this game a while back, and must not have linked it to google play games at the time as my progress is lost, but all the same I\'m happy to start over and do it all again! Great game, keep up the good work!',
       'I love this game but apart from 3 gold, 500 money and 1 hero and 1 weapon crates, I never get any other in the casino spin even though I\'ve been playing with gold. Used around 170 gold just to spin and did not even get any other. Kind of pissed off actually but still playing.',
       'This is 1 of my favourite game but it\'s very hard to play this game without money...Coz you have spend money to buy components to upgrade gun and character...and if you don\'t buy them then you have to wait for 1 year. To collect components' ,

      'Awesome! Best pack opener on the store hands down! 2 problems though.   1. When you have a strong internet and go in to trading it messes up sometimes.  2. Dupilcates cards such as I had one 98 Pelé and ended up coming out with 3 when my opponent did not give me anything.',
       'I LOVE IT! My brothers are addicted to football and told me to download it. I did, not realising how AWESOME this game is (and I\'m a girl). I show them everything I have and do and trade with them all the time. Highly recommend this to anyone who loves football.',
       'It is an amazing game and have been playing it for years. I believe that you should add a option to trade packs and tokens as well. It would bring a new and fresh way of trading items',
       'Its great but I don\'t look me the way we need Google play for trading but apart from that I love it and release lighting rounds more often',
       'Don\'t show what we get in pack battles if we get pele or a toty they just leave it\'s annoying overall good game',

      'Good simple nd great stress buster but at higher levels there is glitch. I got to lvl 570+ and game hangs  and way too slow . Even number on cell exceeds its size.  I scored in advanced part. Hope developers do something about it',
       'Its a really great game and I really recommend it! The only problems I had was the controls are a little weird and there a little bit of too much ads but I dont mind it but I\'d rather you fix it! Thanks for making me happy! ♡',
       'Downloaded this game just to kill some time. It was fun at first but then once I started to play the challenge mode it would not let me see the whole screen during some challenges. So there is no way to win at the challenges that require you finish in a limited number of moves.',
       'Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea',
       'Its a great game i love it. The only problem would be that the speed X2 sign covers how many balls i have left and i hate that maybe try placing that top right hand corner instead of bottom right. I also hate that it only speed up X2 and not anymore but i can live without it',
       'Game is fun and addictive. Ads are horrendous. Can\'t skip/exit and happen all the time. Edit: if you have data and WiFi access disabled, when you back out of ads the screen goes black and won\'t let you play' ,

       'DO NOT INSTALL!! Way too many ads they expect you to sit through, the ads are way too long, even trying to skip them early takes way too long. Just a never ending commercial pretending to be an app. The developers only want money and ought to be ashamed of themselves for this ad bloated app.',

      'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! 😡',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap game😡' ,

      'I gave it 5 star coz it is the best game on Android.  But the some thing need to change or put it the up coming updates.  Like make hardcore game mode to the unskilled and fair place to play with normal guns and normal armors or not with armor just regular health. I m sure you got the point and will make it better. Still love it thank for the best game',
       'Great game. Good job devs. Unlike what some people are saying, that this is p2w. I don\'t think that\'s correct.  I\'m a free to play gamer, and I\'m doing pretty good. You just need to find the propper weapon for yourself(not nessesarily the most expensive one) and the game mode you are most accustomed to. A few improvements could be done though,  like add a few bigger maps. Also please add vehicles like your other game WWheroes. That would be awesome. Also maybe a feature to play with your friends on LAN. Great concept,gameplay,controls,graphics. Thanks guys.....',
       'This is one of the best fps. I tell people who ask me about this game game, its like a call of duty for your phone. I\'ve never really liked to many phone game but just end up dealing with them. I can honestly say I really enjoy this game. The only down fall is it can get expensive and that\'s why I would say 4/5. Money part set a side 5/5 great game.       Thank you for making this game',
       'is a good game. nice graphic and sound. Online and multiplayer. And is modern, you know, in modern world, capital or financial power is needed for battle. So if you spent your rmoney to buy a lot of golds in this game and get better equipment(weapons,armors etc). your strike is better, and faster. And this is online so be aware of connection problem and technical difficulties. Modern-Strike-Online',
       'I totally loved this game. Graphics are great,considering the size of the game,and also runs smoothly even at high graphic setting. But I still wish if it had an offline bots mod,and more importantly, controller support! That would have made me give the game 5 or even 6 stars if possible! Anyway I love playing it!',
       'Over all this game is really good and has high quality graphics compared to other games. The only problem with it is how much gold is required to put attachments on guns. People who play this game that aren\'t going to pay to win are going to leave the game if they can\'t get their hands on a good fun and a good leveled up armor piece .' ,

      'I really love this game. Of course it WANTS you to spend real money on it, but you don\'t really have to to make progress. Just set stuff up then go back to it later. As per other reviews it does take a while to load, but due to the excellent graphics, music and overall feeling of happiness I get playing this - they are forgiven.',
       'Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I\'m not proud of what I\'m about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a "Russian Roulette" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It\'s like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you\'re money concisious don\'t download this game. I\'ve played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you\'re a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.',
       'I\'ve given it 5 stars but really it would be 4.5 stars. The prices of things in this game are stupidly high and they don\'t make it easy for you to get money and gems. It will take you months just to save up to expand one square in the kingdom.',
       'OK I love this game, however have a problem, I recently broke my phone had to send it of to get fixed. Have uploaded this game to my iPad have clicked it over to the correct game to keep my level however gets right to the loading section then kicks me out. My iPad is up to date, can you please fix this bug. I haven\'t played for a few games, the tempary phone I have won\'t let me play either. Please fix..',
       'At first I LOVED this game! I play it everyday. The graphics are amazing. I wish, however, that it wouldn\'t take so long to finish missions. I was super excited to get Wendy for the first 2 weeks. But now I am honestly just bored. I can\'t seem to get enough of the items that Wendy needs. 4 days in a row I have been giving my characters tasks and NOTHING! Not even a stupid ball of wool! And what\'s with the chests?! I spend 60  hard earned gems that took me a month to collect, for a 100 stupid potions and a BENCH??!!! If I am spending 60 gems on a legendary chest, there better be an epic character or a ride in there! If this doesn\'t change, I am afraid I will have to stop playing this game, as it\'s really getting on my nerves. I have been playing it for almost two years. PLEASE, make it more  easily accessible and not determined on real money for awesome characters and things!',
       'I used to love this game, but, I don\'t anymore. It can get kind of lengthy and sometimes tiresome. They make it near impossible to get some characters and attractions without spending real money for them. And if you don\'t, you will take a very..very long time to progress through the game.You may not ever get through it all. After almost 2 years, I\'m tired of it.' ,

      'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Awesome It\'s a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)',
       'Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!' ,

       'Love this game! How about pet machine which gives you a random pet when you use it? You could pay 500, 750 or 1000 gems to spin, and it will give you a new pet! There could be 51 pets, 20 common, 15 rare, 10 ultra rare, 5 legendary ones with super powerful attacks and one golden for fully upgrading the safe,pet food, plant and books! Some ideas for pets are zombie, noob, turret from  the portal series, a cloud and mini versions of the bosses! Thanks!!!!',

I can not say much because this is so crazy. btw thank you very much for fulfilling my previous request about "offline multiplayer". I hope it can be cool if it improves. I\'ll add a star if everything gets better. warm greetings from me',

The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!.

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on \'player choice\' lately.',

Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.' ,

      'Annoying vibrations !! The vibrations wen \'being phoned\' is annoying especially if u are as addicted as me and play it at night. They are so loud and I have to stop playing at night and in the day because of the vibrations can u add in a feature in the settings that enables u to turn them off!! Except from that this is the best game ever and I ADORE it!!',
       'Not even 5 minutes into the app and you already ask for money to view a simple video? It\'s not even a pay once and done thing, it\'s a pass. I\'ve seen some greedy things but this? Oh nah',
       'I love this app but there are a couple downsides to it:  1. Why do you need to pay??? Can\'t it be a one time payment?  2. The vibration is very loud considering I love playing it at night and it wakes everyone up when it\'s video call!!! 3. The amount of time to wait could be reduced to 5 or 10 minutes.  Anyway I hope you can also make an on and off button for vibration! :) Great app though! 😄',
       'Why do u have to pay just to see the picture and the videos? What\'s the point to that? U want us to be addicted to it but some of us can\'t buy it for a reason. Please update this and think about it. I know it\'s a low payment. It u want more people to install it. Please consider this thank u!!',
       'You have to pay just to see a picture or video. If you want to make money do adds cause if someone is gonna waste there time and money on a story than thats just dumb. Either way change it from paying to adds. Like when you click have a add or in a corner  or even when you start the app. I bet my life that the app will be so much more popular if a change happens. Other than that I like it. Sorry for criticizing',
       'So I missed the first big reveal because I didn\'t want to give them money! It refused to let me watch a story critic video without paying them! I would be forgiving of a free game if it wasn\'t something important to the story of a game that is nothing but story.' ,

      'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'Thanks for the new update SEGA. It fixed the "I\'m lagging" condition even though I have fast internet connection and what\'s more you also enchance the Point of view on which lane I would go,Lastly please make Infinite a playable character. Keep up the good work :D',
       'There are a lot of stuff in this game that makes me angry but I keep playing so it has something to offer! I\'m happy with the new maps it makes it more skill based rather than just good luck. It rewards better your good play. I say you should remove the old style maps the are named easy but you are very likely to get punished for bad luck! And fix game crashes or when ever they happen don\'t punish me for it\'s your fault.',
       'Guys please fix the bug which closes the app automatically without any crash message. It simply exits out and takes you to your home screen. I really love this game and would have given a 5 * rating if not for the crash.   Update 23 Feb: The game still crashes, for e.g, the battle was about to start, and the audio started as a matter of fact but the screen simply didn\'t change, it froze, a few seconds later, the game restarts, and now when I try to start a new battle, it says that the previous session is still running. So guys please look into it and make this an already superb game better. My system is a Motorola G5 plus, running Android 7.0 Thanks.',
       'If you like Sonic and need a game to play while sitting on the toilet this is a ton of fun to play and pretty addictive once you get the hang of it. I\'ll warn though that this game has micro-transactions, but they aren\'t as in your face as other games.',
       'Fun fun fun! My 5 year old child is a sonic fan and recently I found this game app for him to play before his afternoon nap to calm him down. He loves it.  Pros:  -unlimited racing chances (do no require stamina or energy that limits you to race) -fair chance of getting new characters from chests without needing to spend money -simple controls and gameplay -variety of race course unlocked depending on how many "trophies" you gain -you get chests whether you place 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th so your time is not wasted -has a decent amount of sonic characters that can be unlocked or upgraded  Cons: -Time chests that you gain from racing (silver, gold, etc.) Are limited to count down only ONE at a time. Lowest time for a countdown is 3 hours, so when you have four 3 hour chests to open, you can only open them 1 at a time. This is the biggest drag since you are limited to four time-limit chests at a time. If they are full, you cannot gain more from your wins until you clear a space.  Other then the one con I have, my son is satisfied with everything else.' ,

      'The game had me hooked as I spent a week trying to find a character and job class I liked. Keep in mind that you will be doing a lot of grinding, but leveling is not surprisingly unreasonable.  There are some aspects that will make you believe you have to pay to win, but it is not necessary. Although it would be cool to help the devs or too. All in all love the game and can\'t seem to put it down ( I let it auto-grind while I live my life. Haha).',
       'Well, I loved the looks of it. Seemed really fun so I downloaded it. Then I spent 30 min downloading the patches, to find out at the very end I didnt have enough space on my phone. Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn\'t have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer',
       'Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don\'t have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well. I play with my monitor using SideSync for full screen awesomeness. There is a lot to do for all types of players, being in a guild doing dungeons reminds me of the old-school MMORPGs of sieging and doing weekly raids.',
       'Everything about this game is really good, but since this update today I can\'t even open the game it keeps closes and sending me to my home screen on my phone... Doesn\'t give me a error report or any messages just closes the app. Id really like to continue playing please fix . Galaxy S8+',
       'This was a good game until you guys lowered the monster core drop rate again with the latest update. It makes it hard for real gamers who play to earn to compete with others that pay to win. You guys really have no consideration for people that play the game on smartphones. With such low monster core drop rates it takes hours upon hours to make any progress and all those hours can cause a smartphone to get VERY hot. Unless this game comes with a phone replacement plan you guys need to fix the game.',
       'I saw this game and was a little skeptical. Felt like my phone would never handle such a thing if it was as good as it looks, well I\'m honestly surprised. Between the nice controls and not having to worry about grinding. To the somewhat intriguing story and overall playability of this game. I\'m very impressed. 5/5' ,

      'I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can\'t agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won\'t run bored of it.',
       'Great, but really needs "sell all" function for dealing with store house and "pecial buildings" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?',
       'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.',
       'Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!',
       'Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s' ,

      'I really do enjoy playing this game. It\'s a great time waster. Good for breaks at work. Public transit. Bored at home. Good graphics. You can choose the controls method. Great car selection. I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. 😁',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   🎵THE STORY🎵  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, 😊 I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! 😉',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Just started playing, so far game seems fun and realistic! The vehicles look real and even use their blinkers and when you honk at the vehicle in front of you, not only do your headlights flash, but it a will actually move out of the way. And it\'s realistic in the fact that you have A..holes that will cut you off just like in the real world! Lol. I also like the fact that if you have minor fender benders the game doesn\'t stop and start over it keeps going. Just wish it had better music, like some good jammin\' driving tunes. 😎' ,

      'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!' ,

      'not gonna mention too much ads, doesn\'t bother me so much. what bother me are words that dont belong in certain language ( specifically  Croatian here). PAZL isn\'t Croatian word for god sake. Lose too much time seeking that word to finish level ,I\'ve lost my nerves. and thats one of many. stupids',
       'I don\'t know how good is game on other languages but in Croatian it sucks. I\'m deleting this game because of constant repetition of non-existent words in Croatian language... Even all dialects included. I even purchased few times coins just to see which word is it and it wasn\'t Croatian.',
       'An ad after EVERY SINGLE TASK? Really? Too much for me, thanks. Otherwise, the game is fun, graphic is good, I like the variety of languages to choose from. Battery goes to hell while playing, even with sounds off - that\'s also an issue.',
       'Why so much ads??? Continuously during game and after each level two more fullscreen ads. And I can\'t pay without providing personal data. Very bad',
       'Okay app, would have given more points but waaaay too many adds. After each level  an add pops up which is very annoying.',
       'Excelent game, but I think that I found something which is not necessarily a bug, but it might be a design flaw. I am playing in eng. lang. and if I need to enter 2 similar words, in my case these were "oar" and "boar", application recognized later, longer word first, even if i entered "oar" first, but system rejected it as incorrect one...' ,

      'An advise read it plz and writ for it if u like! The game is awesome , nyc and funny and chalanging too. but i think it could b more intersesting if we get lifes in it. for example my high score is 22 and i never get on 22 again i remain on 16 or 19 but if i could hav one lyf there i shall surely reached my high score or more..."thanku"',
       'So basically I just sat down to play stick hero. And my goal at the end of the day is to reach at least 100 cherries. Same today. But as I start playing I don\'t find any cherries on my path. "That is weird!" I say to myself. I try to double tap to get cherries it doesn\'t allow it. So I go to the home page to see how many cherries I have ..... the icon isn\'t even there???   Despite that concern, love the game its so much fun ! For u people who are looking for a fun catchy game to play here is the perfect game. Please download so much fun and a great game to put on your device!',
       'Awesome but I have some ideas This game is awesome and it never ceases to make me happy. But buying new characters is kind of pointless. Developers you probably won\'t see this or even care if you do but I think that when you buy new characters the characters should have abilities that you use once a round for free or you can refresh the ability using cherries.',
       'Amazing game...nice timepass.. I love this game.. It is good for kids and I enjoy playing this.. The game doesn\'t hang and I can\'t just stop my fingers writing the review.. In the first level o thought it\'s going to be hard but to my surprise it was easy and smooth... And I loved.. For hours I kept playing it untilthe battery was dead!! The other parts of the game are nice as well especially the voice one!!! Do download😊',
       'False Advertising I mean, in a way. The help example is slower than the actual game. The platform grows faster and the guy runs across instead of the leisurely stroll in the \'tutorial\'. Maybe have an option for speed, slower or faster depending on what the player feels like tackling that day. Still a fun game, but come on. We\'re not all finger-ninjas.',
       'Simply but satisfying It\'s a very addictive game. I think the little character(s) are adorable. The only complaint I have is when you grab a cherry and then you fall because the stick isn\'t long enough-in my opinion you should still get the cherry put in your "bank". I also like the watermelon level.' ,

      '◉ New Slash Watermelon game mode!',
       '◉ 5 new Heroes to unlock! Collect cherries and unlock new Heroes.',

      'A very very important app for its portability especially for market trading and the SBCs. Unfortunately as important as it is, eventhough the app is very useful, convenient and pretty looking, the difficulty for you to login every time alone has killed all the good things that comes with it. I literally have to update the app by uninstalling and reinstalling at times to be able to login again. This is bizarre, this is horrendous.',
       'Plain and simple it has no stability, keeps rejecting logins, no trust whatsoever in the bidding process, utterly disgusted and sick and tired of getting emails to confirm codes, and answering to security questions. Not even pay pal bothers me that much. Needless to say my home bank app. Shove this app.. 👆 🍑',
       'Very good app. But always telling me that there is a problem with connecting to the servers but my internet is perfectly fine. It would only work if I delete it and reinstall it. And I have done that twice now and still no change. Please fix this and I\'ll will rate it 5 stars.',
       'Terrible. Made few signings and did not appear in transfers to collect my players. That was like after buying five players and i realized it. I think it works only if u buy player one by one and send to club. Wasted my coins.',
       'When I first installed it on galaxy s8 worked fine but now for some reason the app icon has disappeared, preventing me from opening the app. Now the only way I can open it is to go into the playstore and where it would normally say \'install\' it says \'open\' and this is the only way I can get into the app. When I delete it and reinstall it the icon appears on my home screen for a day or two and then disappears again. Please fix.',

      'Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.',
       'Was totally looking forward to playing this game, the graphics were so cute that I couldnt help but download, but I havent even gotten past the tutorial and its frozen? The game started panning to the billboard right after you sell your first visitor the cream and then it just froze and now it won\'t let me continue on.' ,

      'You see I\'m not the only person  who wouldn\'t recommend this game. Adds constantly and how could you play they game when it\'s so tricky to drive. I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I\'m not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won\'t make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.',
       'The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app',
       'Th is game sucks! It\'s a total waste of time and it is so boring. This is the worst game ever😡😤 Also there are so many stupid ads! The taxi is so slow and when other cars get in front of you it\'s even slower. I would not recommend this game to anyone!',
       'First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕',
       'I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions',
       'I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver.' ,

      'I love this game, it\'s fun, cute, and I love collecting these fish!The only thing is that I don\'t want to end up finishing this game too quickly, just wish there were more fish so the game could last a long time. Overall though, I think this game is awesome and you guys did a great job! And I know my opinion doesn\'t really matter since I\'m just one kid, but I really like this game.',
       'Overall I liked the game. However, I have a few suggestions to make. First, could you please make it so the fish food is more effective or that you can upgrade it as another review said. Second, please make the time shorter because 1 hour is really long and gems are so hard to earn. Third, please make the tank more interactive. Like, you could make it so you can give the fish fish food or breed the fish or make the fish swim around freely instead of in their own level of water. Thanks!!!',
       'overall, this game is very enjoyable and charming. a great way to pass the time. i only have one issue. it seems there\'s a graphic flaw when the legendary fish in our tank swim in those buldge-things. some of their frames become blocked and they appear strange. only issue i have so far.',
       'Adorable. I like how everything can be upgraded, catching the fish is the best part. Its very fun. You should really tell people that they can just swipe up in their aquarium to see their other fish because a lot of people seem to be confused by that. Other than than it\'s a cute game.',
       'I enjoy playing this game because the visuals are cute and the different fish you can collect are very interesting. I have a few problems with the game though, like how you can accidently waste your gems on getting a fish to come (It\'s hard to get gems in this game...). Also, there\'s not much to do in the fish tank. Other than that, it\'s a good game.',
       'The game is so awesome !!!! I love this game . It\'s very addictive . Can you add more fishes,  baits,  characters and more in the future ??.... PLEASE!!!! And the main thing is , please reduce the waiting time ..... You have wait like 1 hour which is too much .' ,

      'reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.',
       'Server disconnect constantly even on WiFi. I\'ve also ran into problems with the game freezing. I understand that this is a new game with only days after release but the constant disconnecting is beginning to be a problem. update I bought a new phone and lost my game progress. I don\'t think Facebook should be a requirement to a continue with the game.',
       'My loot cases are not being delivered also this game eats a lot of data.. There\'s no offline play options, I have 4 GB ram and still this is too slow, my reversal moves get stuck and there\'s no option to play it without internet, stupid game updates everyday and sends me notifications constantly.. Please improve it and stop asking for money',
       'I\'ve addicted to this game. But there\'s one problem that when in the versus mode we have to stop that the lucky draw like thing if we r getting a superstar the game cheats us and give money instead of that superstars.This is only a drawback of the game.. The producers of this game must fix this problem 🙂🙂',
       'I love this game . Now it is my favorite game . But in future can you add some story plz ?.......   ...That will awesome . They are fighting for something right ?      Some of them for revenge , some of them championship , interference add anything .        Without those the game is still awesome .',
       'I believe the blocking mechanism needs to be fixed because once you hold to block it lets go for a split second which has you being hit in that small opening of a spot. Please fix it it\'s honestly ruining the game for me and many others I know that play this.' ,

      'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'This is a great game that I\'ve played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it\'d still fun to play. My only gripe is that there\'s no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it\'ll be 5 stars all the way for me.',
       'Okay, so I got this game on my phone, and it was amazing! Very fun, very addictive, and overall just very enjoyable. But then I got it on my Samsung Galaxy E 8 tablet, and the game was stretched out to fit the screen. I don\'t mean just a little stretched out either, I mean so stretched that it made it difficult to actually enjoy the game as I was once able to. Thats why I gave the game such a low rating.... Please, please fix this though! I love this game so much, but this huge handicap is holding me back from being able to play the game and have fun. I\'ll just delete the app for now, since I can\'t even play it. But I\'ll redownload it in the future and hopefully the problem will be fixed by then. Until that happens though, I\'ll keep my rating on the game low. But don\'t worry, as soon as you fix it, my five stars will come back!' ,

      'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn\'t be EA\'d. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Only 3 ponies to play with, or 2 for certain people. If you want them all, you MUST pay $5.00 to defeat the pay wall and continue, otherwise reset the game and play the free levels again, with the SAME ponies, Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, and Applejack, for the people who got 3 ponies, for the people who have 2, you have Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy. The game is fun but the pay wall problem has got to go.',
       'Ads popped up every 45 seconds. I timed it. Made the game useless for my son (4). And he really wanted to play it too.' ,

      'I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It\'s a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don\'t mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It\'s the price you pay to get a good, free game. It\'s not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.',
       'It\'s a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I\'m not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.',
       'I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I\'m going to try another app now.',
       'I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn\'t like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.',
       'I don\'t like game advertising that you can\'t control.  This game has very good user control of the adverts.  Now if something can be done about the loud volume on the ads, I would give this game 5 stars.  I find double tapping the draw card a little hard. Much better ad control than other Solitaire games.',
       'Better than most Solitaires. I wanted a quiet game that I can play whilst waiting for appointments and this fits the bill. Most Solitaire apps make loud noises during game play but this is very subdued so doesn\'t disturb other people. Please don\'t change it!' ,

      'Good fun until you figure out that you only need to build area 52 up. At level 500 it jumps by 5000000% or something stupid. Meaning can clear a planet in just hours. Needs a different hook to it. After a few planets it\'s a bit stale.  The choices to buy in multiples of needs moving. With fat fingers I\'ve caught the research aswel as hitting Max a few times',
       'Usual game where numbers get ridiculous and good at killing time. Very good features and well balanced - so far. Like with many of these games nearer the later stages the completion time can be calculated and nobody wants to tap for 211 years to complete the next round. Hopefully this game sidesteps that.',
       'Update to previous review: Devs seem on it. After the last update there seemed to be a bug or two. A couple of us let them know and they fixed it within a week. Good game, come and go on your own time, well maintained. Thanks guys!  --------- I\'d have to agree about the slow down for the red bacteria after the update. It used to come between 1.5 and 3 mins. Now I can go 10 minutes looking at the screen before one comes. It makes the game more of a waste of time than fun. Other than that, I was really liking it. Played it more than most games.',
       'If you just want an idle clicker, it\'s not bad at all.  However, if you\'re more interested in the research/mutation aspects of the game, you\'re probably gonna be disappointed.  Research/mutation provide permanent (but unnecessary) buffs to your bacteria (or new types of bacteria).  Problem is that the success rate of research is ridiculously low unless you opt for the 24 hour version, so you won\'t get much out of research.  Since mutation requires two unused types of bacteria (which come from research), you won\'t be using that, either.  It\'s really a shame considering those were very unique aspects to this game that set it apart from most clickers.',
       'I updated the game and it deleted all of my progress...I had 7 plus day in a row and almost 10 planets defeted...seriously? Besides that it was fun.',

      'Very very addicting game. I have both 1 and 2 that I play daily. Loving it! Only problem is sometimes when I win a lot of Coral Eggs I can not get them because it says my hero bag is too full. So if I do not get rid of objects in my bag right away I lose all of my hard earned work.',
       'I\'ve never had this problem untill tonight. When I start a guild boss battle. It starts off fine. About 15-20 seconds into the battle. It goes super fast. Almost like a battle fast forward. Making me miss my skills useage etc. What the hell?',
       'I am very disappointed that in lords league u give above 150 Hero and for defence 200 level Hero my hero r level 93......... thats why I edit and give 3 🌟I was given 5 🌟 first',
       'Great game but the matchmaking for guild clash is ridiculous because I can\'t see how my guild who are 308th can be matched with a guild that\'s 118th and 97th!!! This definitely needs fixing!!!',
       'Love it, never seen such a game like this. May not be better than others, but definitely up there in top 10 android games in my oppinion!',
       'You should should see to it. My current level is 34 and when I play arena/lords league I am matched with plays with levels 50 and above. Its totally unfair. You should do the match with players having 2 more/less than the level of the playing player' ,

      'Great game, lots of fun. Would give it 5 stars but it is WAY TOO SHORT! More cities and continents to conquer, please...I\'d conquered everything and wasn\'t even halfway done upgrading all of my unit types, and had barely even touched all the general, base and army upgrades you get from leveling up. More achievements would be nice too!',
       'The game is pretty good. Not terribly long but yes it\'s addictive which makes it shorter. I wish towers and catapults were automated. In later levels I\'m trying to click so frequently I can\'t focus on watching the fights.',
       'The concept is good but its just too easy. I am level 9 and took out the level 75 city in 1 try. Its not very challenging and you don\'t make a ton of money so its boring',
       'a nice game thats not too complicated, graphics arnt that great but the game makes up forit. there is a wierd blue flicker when in map mode and any ads that arise in map mode.',
       'Adorable armies that are too dumb to train cost effectively. Grind for gold, or keep peace at the wall for days by ignoring that it\'s there. Play in short sessions.',
       'Not like most phone games, doesn\'t seem like pay to win, but haven\'t figured out yet if there is a way to earn red gems without paying for them.' ,

      'One of the best ARPGs on mobile! My only critique is that it needs more variations in outfits, as well as enabling people that don\'t pay ridiculous sums of money to access things like wings a little bit easier.',

      'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Great single player. Fun gameplay thats simple but entertaining. Decent customization and great upgrades. A little pushy on spending money but it\'s ignorable. My issue is with multiplayer. I can never connect with anyone which I don\'t have any interest in. But two out of three of my goals are for beating other players. One wants to me to beat thirty people. That\'s ridiculous.',
       'Best drag racing game I\'ve played, and I\'ve played many. The only problem is to advance, it can get a little pricey, to get parts for certain types of cars that are needed for special events. As far as Special Events. I do believe that they make the game what it is. I hope that they bring back a New TEMPEST! Once you get past the 3, the only thing that keeps the game interesting are the Special Events. I KNOW THAT I\'M THE ALONE WHEN I SAY THAT WE WANT A NEW STORY LINE! Bottom line, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes cars and drag - racing. The line up is awesome!' ,

      'It is too frustrating! I would like if you could choose other levels besides only one. I wish there was much more to the game but I guess it will have to do...',
       'I posted a good comment about this game but after 10 more levles it got rage quitting and frustrating it forces u to quit. Then there was way too much adds. I recommend you not getting this game. Every one look at the comments before you get any game.😡😠',
       'Super basic, yet decent game.  After level 50, it just gets frustrating since the rythm becomes arbitrary.',
       'A quick eye and brain interaction game to insert lines between other lines onto moving inner circle. Challenging until you lose interest. Not habit forming in the least.',
       'I think this app is good ENOUGH not amazing as when it compliments you on Level 50 it says nice everytime-this is IRRTIATING. It repeatedly says it everytime i fail the level and want to try again.If this carries on i will put absolutely no stars for this game because of the dumb manufacturers who refused to change it.',

      'I love this game! It has challenging levels that are not impossible to beat. The most annoying and irritating is that the game takes too long to recognize that it needs to shuffle when there are no more available moves. Could you plz fix that? Also I hate the yogurt :)  Thanks!',
       'Love the game, but at the end of all main levels and completed both valentine\'s update and Chinese New year update. Can you give a date when update for main game is coming please? as the game is taking up space on my tablet so will delete as can\'t play until update. Thanks',
       'I really like playing this game, but I\'ve hit a wall on having no more levels to play. Please extend game asap. All I can do now is go watch videos for coins or bombs',
       'Love this game. I like to hear the animal sound effects in the background as it can reduce my anxiety.  However, would you please let us choose whether we want to hear the animal sounds or music background? It\'s quite noisy and annoying to hear both of them simultaneously. Please also consider to add more animal sounds such as birds or gibbons so it feels more like we\'re in the zoo',
       'Love it, keeps me busy for hours but there are a few bugs that need to be sorted out. #1: It is constantly crashing. #2: I can\'t log in to Facebook. #3: I can\'t change my name from Player, the one already in game. Those are the only reasons that I didn\'t give it 5 stars. Other then that, I love it',
       'For me this is definitely not relaxing. There are way too many issues like the time clock, the fact that when you earn a credit to complete a task it is not recognized, completing a task and not having to take a taken. These are just a few of the things but if it could be fixed I would absolutely love this game it has captured my attention even though I\'m frustrated' ,

       'Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked!

       'I like the game but the ads are annoying and i dont like the face rhat we actually have to buy stuff for the game and put real money into something we are probably going to delete within the same month we got it. I think its a waste of money but the game is good i guess.',
       'This is clearly a game for young girls around 9-13 years of age. What money will the developer make from 9-13 year olds with no job? Nothing, hence the ads! Makes sence to me! The game play is good for this age group. If you find it boring then you are probably too old for this game.' ,

      'I love this game. Unfortunately if you advance to far the performance breaks heavily, because there is just too much going on {I\'m on 10 assembly lines}. I\'d love to see bigger areas (so I can build a super computer per tick) and maybe a multi selector splitter 3 way to make my lines even better. But all in all this game kept me busy for hours and I love it.',
       'Suggestions: allow the game to run in the background while it is paused. Currently have to kill the app before it\'ll start the offline play. Not a big deal but I\'d like to continue gaining resources if I quickly go to another app. Also, a great feature would be a current statistics window. It could show current total electricity costs per machine type per second, amount of resources generated per second, amount of crafted items per second, and money gained per second per item. It would allow you to see which items are more efficient.',
       'Fun game and really cool concept. Could definitely be refined further and it would get 5 stars.   I\'m finding an issue with the $/s tracker in game. Either the tracker is off or something in the game isn\'t right. I have 3 washers ($1100 each) being sold every 2 seconds. That\'s $1650/s. But the tracker is reading between $650-$1000/s. Which is not even close to what it should be...',
       'Lost a lot of actual productivity making my fake assembly lines as productive as possible, loved every second. You can also make a simple but effective line, then leave it for a few days to make bank (assembly line keeps making money even while the phone is off). 4/5 because I lost all my progress by accident.',
       'fun game, I\'ve also seen user\'s suggestions added. no premium currency! ads are not forced, and in game payout for watching ads increases as you progress.   suggestions for improvement.  area select. 1 at a time takes awhile.  copy/paste area and line. you could also change more for machines to make it more fair.  erase assembly line  shipping and receiving docks for moving stuff between lines  customer contracts. this could make the game more engaging  a forum to discuss the game.  overall you have a good thing going here. I look forward to see where this goes',
       'This game is great. It\'s a ton of fun if you enjoy planning, automation and complex building. I was totally addicted, but after building my supercomputer factory I\'m kinda waiting for more content, recipes, or challenges. 2 thoughts - the control responsiveness and ui could use a bit of love, and sometimes the game randomly lags out until I restart. All in all though, I love it - 5 stars.' ,

My kids enjoy playing the game as well I think it\'s much better than boring football. This game is good for hands and eyes cor_dination as well.',
       'Need to fix......I\'ve beaten every level up to 35 on regular hard and crazy but it glitches while loading level 36 and won\'t play. Plus I\'m fully upgraded and when I have my best ship with my best side kicks all the bullets make the game go crazy glitch and screw up. Please fix for a 5 star.....if not I\'ll change to a 1 star and uninstal. Thanks  They never fixed it. Don\'t bother if you want a game you can complete! Last five levels will not load. So hurting! And best sidekick glitches game play too badly for play at all! 😠😠😠',

      'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       'Well the animals are cute and the drawings are cute, but I thought you could use the rainbow color like in the picture,but you can\'t😢you should still get this app and definitely of you like drawing. It\'s still fun though!😆' ,

      'Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!',
       'Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn\'t deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it\'s to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.',
       'It\'s fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I\'ve failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.',
       'I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on "memory match" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it\'s worth installing.',
       'This is completely addicting in a way I\'ve never felt before! I can still walk away from it but the concepts seem so simple yet provide enough challenge to make me think of it even when I\'m not playing! It\'s delightful to say the least!',
       'Hi, no support team is there, i have a problem- Not able to play Multi tasking game, its hanged - not scrolling after 3rd level, plz help me to play, need to complete tht game, other than this all r gud game to play. Intrsted to play , but no challenging all r very easy to complete the levels' ,

      'It\'s the best I found. Not many ads, none flashing. Has the most puzzle choices I found. Easy to see, and can enlarge tile size. Pick any tile choice. Easy to use. Ending game closed fast. Automatic goes to next game. Keep tracks of games played. Play with friends worked good. Only thing I noticed, It scuffles tiles around when no more moves possible. Scuffles 6 out of 10 games, leaving 4 games not scuttled. And didn\'t mess with my cell. Very happy with game app. Have fun!  Martha 😊',
       'It\'s simple learn controls on, you can change the tiles to different styles for easier time or a challenge (try the flags!).  5 modes of difficulty (they added Hard 1, 2 and 3 instead of one Hard recently).  I have it on a WIFI only tablet, only way to avoid ads is airplane mode. I\'d be willing to pay a dollar for my phone version to be ad-free forever.  Ads have gotten a little aggressive lately on a lot of Play Store games.',
       'Game flows nicely. Doesn\'t bog down my phone like some others. I love that the screens actually load. Lol. Nice layout. Tons of boards. Ads are not overwhelming and don\'t interrupt gameplay. Edit: changed phones, and while it kept my achievements, it did not save any of my completed games! Plus i feel like it\'s a little too easy to 3 star every board. I still really like it though.',
       'I love this game. It\'s my go to when I need to do something. My only issue is when playing multiplayer. When the "you lose" comes up, you could be mid-play and end up hitting menu, thus ending the game you\'re playing. Which, is highly annoying, especially if it\'s a good opponent and you basically go back and forth winning. The likelihood of getting that player again really isn\'t that great.',
       'Game is great! Highly appreciate that commercials are kept out of view and does not need permissions. Just a few things that could make this game greater; could have "move back " option -/ the tile selection could be more vibrant/ next move help option could ad to it. /  If additionally I could tilt the view a little or rotate the board - for sure, this game should be a five star rated.',
       'This game has a problem with the size of the tiles getting bigger or smaller. When you slide them down the next time you touch the screem it goes straight to the largest size.' ,

      'It\'s a good cover-based shooter, with some pretty creative characters and a good pace for quick battles. The unlock system is more than fair, with the ability to save currencies for that one big purchase. I enjoy the ability to play at my own pace without sacrificing my life to the game (cough*Kabam*cough) and I\'m having a lot of fun. I\'ve noticed that PVP tends to favor Savage, when he activates Spray and Pray once, half the opposing team dies. Twice, and the round is over. Otherwise a very well done and enjoyable game.',
       'I like this game a lot. I was really hoping that it would have a mode that lets you play with other players on your team. Something like a 3v3 or a 5v5. Something where you would choose a hero and you could play with other players but you could only use that one character. Something that you can play with real players on the same team against the enemy team. I would love a game mode like that instead of just pvp. Please consider it, other than that it is really fun!',
       'I really enjoy the action this game brings along with good looks and simple controls. Too many times development teams get caught up in the visuals or complex control schemes and forget about what gamers really love and that\'s not having a complex control panel with nice smooth transition from level to level. Thank you for making this game a joy to play every time I turn it on.',
       'Good concept. Good game. Many glitches. For a game that\'s touted for and based on pvp it makes no sense that %80 of the time the game freezes going into a pvp battle. It\'s okay though, you can close it and then immediately reopen it to a message that tells you that you died. Fix your freezing problems and I\'d give you 4 stars.',
       'Good game plagued by hackers who like mimicking Crosses stun constantly.    As well as I would wish the AI would auto pilot itself a bit better when your controlling a hero then having to decide if you want to control a hero at the cost of your other members being brick headed or every One being average.',
       'Update: they fix the graphics issue. Great game. If you can , would be nice to see the graphics get polished, hopefully they look better in the future...  Old : Graphics terrible, needs fixing asap,gameplay looks fun. Device: Nvidia Shield Tablet' ,

For example:<br><br>- multiplayer endless runner<br>- multiplayer birds with flapping wings<br>- platform jumping game<br>- 3-in-a-row with Tic-Tac-Toe like rules<br>- crossing a busy road together<br>- bingo<br>- a strategy game where you send armies to capture castles (has nasty AI in single-player)<br>- football / soccer (close to Pong and hockey)<br>- a multiplayer version of the 1024/2048 puzzle<br>- tapping only your own tiles<br>- balloon popping<br><br>We regularly add new mini-games.

      'For anyone saying it doesn\'t make sense - this is a logic puzzle game. You use the hints to eliminate numbers and get as close as you can to the solution. Sometimes it won\'t narrow down 100% and you might have to be lucky, but that\'s why you have multiple attempts each turn until you get a high solve streak. This game is a good time passer and workout for the brain.',
       'This game is a logic based game, but the logic can only take you so far. In many instances, there are two or even three possible solutions. Unfortunately as you go up in level, you have to play a guessing game as the number of chances go down... And when there are multiple logical solutions... Eventually there will be a failure based only on bad luck.',
       'Someone reviewed saying that if you have multiple solutions, you\'re doing it wrong. That\'s incorrect. You absolutely can have multiple solutions that fit all given hints, but the game will only accept one. At that point, it\'s no longer a puzzle game, but a luck-based guessing game. Put in one of the multiple solutions and hope it\'s the one.',
       'This is a cheap way to learn how frustrating sudoku is, but without any built-in pattern checking. Found up to 6 "correct" answers per question that matched all clues but were rejected. Make a better system, or don\'t half-ass this one.',
       'No discription on what to do when you begin the game. I find this highly confusing and shows the developer is lazy and just bad overall. Boring and awfully made is what I can say in conclusion',
       'Good time waster but once you worked out the pattern it gets too easy' ,

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.',
       'This is a fun action game! I\'m so addicted to it right now and I\'m completely hooked into the game\'s story. The fight animation is just brilliant, unique moves based on real martial arts, fighting styles that vary with each weapon, beautiful background locations, exciting music! It\'s perfect!',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'As much as I like this game, the final boss is unnecessarily difficult. Seriously, what were you thinking when you came up with it? And the game crashes more than I\'d like. But the game is really well done! Flaws and all, it worked out well. Nicely done.' ,

      'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'I would get to the title page and that was it. It won\'t let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'It\'s an disaster game. It doesn\'t even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.',
       'So, this game is very exciting, but i have problems with defeating the monsters, and after this "update" nothing changed, so next time make new levels! I MEAN, COME ON !! Other than that, game is great.' ,

It just stayed on the "checking for new content" status and I have reinstalled the game so many times. I hope this gets fixed soon, I\'d really hate to not play anymore. UPDATE: still not working :( is there any fix to this issue? Shall i give up on this game? So disappointing.',

       'Have played for a while.  Would be happier if it actually loaded.  Progress sits at initialising.  Have uninstalled & reinstalled several times & game still doesn\'t load.  **update** Seems the issues with trying to play this game continue. Again have unistalled & re-installed, attempted to load existing game & it sits at "downloading content". Appears there are several players experiencing the same issue.  Please fix.',
       'Cutest game ever... Easy to get caught up making and selling things. The characters are enjoyable too. The only downfall is the availability of tools needed to clear the property. No sledge hammers, and rare shovels. 😥 Other than lack of supplies, the game is awesome! 😉 😀',
       'LMAO, u ppl gave the update I guess a week ago, but still no sign of the event. The order board is still stale. No changes in it. The app keeps crashing. It\'s a lovely one though, but the problems are hampering it. Please check on it',
       'The damn updates... they always freeze the game. This Valentine\'s Day event has been the worst. Haven\'t been able to use the app at all. I guess I\'ll return after the February freeze fest is over. Hopefully then I can use or I\'ll just get rid of the app.' ,

      'Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.',
       'Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don\'t get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a "Create a Player" option under \'My Club\' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It\'d be so nice if you add that.',
       'I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks',
       'This Game is what all soccer fans around the world have been waiting for. It is fun and easy to play once you master the controls. The graphics are exciting and the gameplay fantastic. However there are some things i would like the dream league team to improve.  Rate at which coins accumulate is way to slow for the games played. Reward players with a free secret player for every division completed. Make the game slightly more difficult and improve Goal keepers.  Include some legendary teams like invicibles in the Elite division challenges. Overall great game.',
       'Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the "First Touch" as fast as possible.',
       'Great game. Controls could seize to work at times (not very often though) but as a whole, it is a fantastic game. Quality graphics and game play. It would be nice if the game could auto-update(with internet connection) so teams could be updated and players could be at their current clubs e.g Coutinho (Barca), Alexis (Man utd ), Mkhritaryan(Arsenal)etc. Love this game' ,

      'YOU CAN SKIP THE ADS!!!    (just press back!)  Fun little game for those who think engineering is fun, but not as niche as that might sound!   There are plenty of similar games,  but I found this 1 quite varied and isn\'t greedy like some of its competitors. There are ads, but you can press back straight away and don\'t have to watch them. (I think some of the grumbling 1star reviewers missed that you can skip the ads.. ..but the game does require a certain amount of intelligence, so...)',
       'While this is a mediocre puzzle game, it is a terrible physics game. The vehicle doesn\'t accelerate, free falling is just a constant velocity downwards. What the developers ought to know is that forces cause ACCELERATION. This is why catapults are useless and why it makes every interraction weird. If anything it makes you think less in terms of physics, that is suposedly the aim of the game.',
       'Too many Ads! After every level or a refresh, an ad pops up.. And you can\'t even close it for 5 seconds! I accept you wanna make money, but at least let me enjoy an uninterrupted game for a bit!',
       'Horrible Ads-Management!! After each level whether you pass it or reply it, an 5 seconds Ad pops up full screen. I know people need their bucks, but not this way.',
       'Good idea but very poor execution,  game lags heavily if you come up with an innovative way to pass the level using a "real time" idea. Forced to basic box everything instead of a timing idea.  To basic to make you really think and plan.',
       'I idea of the game seemed really fun but it gave no instructions and on the third level it was impossible. Twisted and messed up don\'t waste ur time.' ,

      'IMPORTANT👇 lnstaII "UNOPAY" App Enterr (SOTA) To Start Earnings So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. uno points equals uc instead of like some of the others where it takes uno points to reach uc etc....Also,👍TOYOCASH App is very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Patmy. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Very good concept with the stay at home type game show. I have been playing this trivia for about a week now and it has been very fun for me and my family. Ive had some trouble with the whole settings concept but Ive gotten use to it very cool and educational trivia (5 star rating)',
       'Awesome new game that combines the best of live TV with the convenience of mobile apps. I am hooked! Even if I don\'t win, I learn interesting new things every time I play. Some early problems have been overcome, they keep raising the stakes, and now it\'s full steam ahead. Highly recommended!',
       'The game used to be fun and challenging. But now that I\'ve been streamed into the European game rather than the American game I hardly know any answers. We may write the Queen\'s English in Canada, but we usually have no idea what is common culture in the UK. We watch American programming. Switch us Canucks back.',
       'I have half a mind to delete this app after the new update. At first I just had one extra life that disappeared, but now whenever I send out my referral code, I don\'t gain a single extra life! And this is still happening to this day, no matter how many people use my referral code, I don\'t get an extra life. It\'s so frustrating because I\'ve complained about this glitch before and nothing has been done to change it. I\'m begging you HQ, please fix this',
       'Awesome game!  Feels very unique in that I\'ve never played anything like it before.  For those that haven\'t played it before... It\'s like  Who wants to be a Millionaire but played in a social media setting.  One request for the developers would be to give us the ability to change an answer before the timer runs out. I\'ve accidentally clicked the wrong answer and been eliminated!' ,

Mind you , she is 18 years old and literally NEVER likes games. But she got addicted to this within 10 minutes!!! She spends the whole time playing this game when we go shopping together. I love this game so much!!',
       'I love this game - it\'s a classic and you\'ve done it well. The one thing that bothers me is the grammar wherein you write, "Ouch, no more valid moves". The letter O should be capitalized and there should be a space after the comma located before the word, \'no\'. Please fix this so I don\'t go crazy, thanks!',
       'It is a good game.I liked it and it will improve your brain as we have to think that where we can put the block.It doesn\'t take much MB and it\'s interesting. I am wishing for more and more games like this',
       'This game is for really borred people, i try something else but it was low quality than this one! Keep up with the good work guys!',

Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.Play with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.Designed for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.Bored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play\'s "Game Services".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden. Instead you must find the words within the grid. Useful in combination with word categories.2) Play against others.3) Give us feedback on other features you would like to see.Dictionaries available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Indonesian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian(Latin), Serbian(Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovene, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and more coming later',

I like that can change the min length of a word. And you can choose the difficulty. And the max word length brilliant the only thing I would say. Is can you put more choices of colours for background colours. And list colours. Also button colours',

      'Game became sluggish after update, the pads sounds only occur a few millisecinds afyer touching but its a noticeable difference. Makes all songs sound terrible. Sounds often mash together eg. In otherside, when you play the bass and guitar together, the bass becomes boosted and makes a sound as if a speaker is put too loud',
       'Some bugs and problems. It keeps saying "no space left on the device" even though I deleted some apps, tried to clear the cache and move the app to the sd card, still no enough, pls fix this. I going reinstall it though see if it fix. Also add more features and option to fits. By the way the device I\'m using is Samsung 355 4:3 screen ratio, 16 gb storage expandable',
       'Was good at the first... But.. When i create a  kit a cant hear anything even when i cut a part from my song i can\'t hear.... Can you  please fix the problem (my phone is oppo f3+',
       'Okay i will give 5 stars but please fix the problem that it will say like. There is no space left on the device? Why the hell tho. I got 2 gb of space left. Cmon. Please fix this i love the music guys there\'s no doubt but please fix this.',

      'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up.' ,

      'Pretty cool game. Like the simple concept of taking something we have all done at one time or another and turning it into a video game.  Genius. I really like the sense of accomplishment I get when I make a trick shot like a bank shot off the boss\'s head and no rim just straight in! It\'s like he shoots he scores! The crowd goes wild! ..fake crowd roar...',
       'The game makes me feel things down in my nether region super fun to play. When I throw the paper ball I\'m like sweeeeeeeeet. I daydream about playing when I\'m at work. The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',
       'Wow, this game is fantastic! How have I not downloaded this before?? The controls are easy to use and very responsive. So far I haven\'t run into any bugs so that\'s good. I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!',
       'Disappointing. Paper Toss Boss used to be known as Paper Toss 2, though the name isn\'t all that has changed. For one thing, there are now WAY too many ads. Every time I change a level, an ad comes up. Inexcusable. And to make it worse, the game lags more. If my old Android 2.2 phone can run Paper Toss 2 with no problem, then the same should be said with this version and my new Android phone. Considering it a classic game ruined.',
       'After the last update the game sucks so bad. Tons of add, lag, the interface moves poorly, after 5 minutes i just gave up and uninstalled it. Used to be so much fun before. Please go back to the previous versiob!',
       'Great except two things... ... the fact that I can\'t turn off that tab on the left that flashes at me when I suck. No I don\'t want a hint or buy some gimmick. Just let me throw the ball in peace. It\'s nagware and it is so annoying it makes me not want to play the game. Make it appear *once* then give the option to banish it.ALSO there is a game breaking glitch that happens frequently where I throw a ball and it goes in but then nothing happens, I don\'t get another ball, I can\'t access any menus, the game is frozen. This happens every' ,

ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! FIX.   IT.    NOW!!!',
       'I played it on my Dad\'s phone, but only until I got my own tablet. But every time I try to play it on my tablet,(at the title screen)it crashes, and sez:Error. Unfortunately, MERLOK 2.0 has  crashed. PLEASE FIX THE ANNOYING ERROR!!!!!!!!!!!',

       'My younger cousin really enjoys this game and it keeps him entertained for hours, which is gr8 as he has ADHD. The only problem that stops us from giving this game a 5 star rating is a small bug, on the fact that he can\'t get through to arronville which upsets and annoys him when the game crashes, please fix this problem as it would be a brilliant help to us. Thanks. Btw I would recommend this game , just beware of some small problmes but dont worry as they always update this app to sort these problems out.',

It uses self-replicating nano technology to consume everything in its path and convert their matter into its own. There&apos;s no telling how big this shark will get.',

      '30 second unskippable ad after three easy puzzles... immediately put me off of playing this. In the brief time I played this I spent more time looking at an ad than actually in the game... rubbish',
       'Very easy, boring and full of unskippable ads for no reward. Not a very clever game as some have suggested, this gives the player no sense of accomplishment nor any legitimate challenge unless you do not speak English.',
       'Well guys.. I just broke the game 😂 it was the \'HEADLIGHT\' puzzle where I got stuck. I requested for a hint and I accidentally tapped out the E in it and now it\'s completely gone. There\'s no letter E no more in there. You should check this out. (So I requested a hint twice, went wrong on the word and then tapped E, and poof, it\'s gone) and maybe you should make a reset puzzle button for situations like this. 😃',
       'Just got really boring. In a group of 10 puzzles there was; 1 that was a clever brain teaser, about 7 that were just way too easy and severely lacked creativity, and at least 2 that were just genuinely terrible often making little to no sense whatsoever and then it just turned into a game of hangman with unlimited guesses. Clearly this was made by a team or individual who thinks that they are supper clever and witty but in reality just wanted to make a few easy bucks by showering people with adds and a completely unnecessary currency system.',
       'Its a great gane but is always glitching out.For example I have three leters after I use a hint,then I earn a hint and the other letter just disapears and it did not go onto the word or phrase.',
       'After completing 55 levels I get a blank screen. Are there any plans to add new levels?' ,

      'So I buy myself a weapon, armour and bag (11-ish Euros worth) because I wanted an early dungeon explore. And it was amazing. Loved it! But later on I was farming wood and fought few zombies...random guy appears and hits me once killing me and stealing my stuff...the stuff you buy shouldn\'t be stolen like that. I feel like that guy stole me money not gear...games shouldn\'t make you feel that way. That\'s why I am deleting this...',
       'This is a remake a few times here and you would think that it would have been perfected a bit!..... I spent money right out the gate to put my self in a good position, and got cocky and died....... ok fine..... BUT .... come on now, I lost it all!..... money spent and lost like that?....... NO, NO, NO.. ......',
       'It is a poorly made copy of last day on earth and unlike jurassic survival it doesn\'t add anything original aside from the theme of course. It doesn\'t even have the keys to get into the dungeons. It might get better when they add in the dungeons.',
       'I wanted to know if it\'s multiplayer? Or other online players can fight you? Beside that game is pretty good. GOOD JOB.',
       'more interesting n less complicated that last day on earth. just some things is hard to find or how to make like eg. bowstring..',
       'I wasn\'t sure at first because there has been to many copies of Last Day on Earth: Survival...but this game feels more imersive because of time zone and immersed experience. I feel it has alot more potential tha LDoE and i feel it will be more balanced and i hope it not just gonna be pay to win!..... Please developers other than that GREAT WORK!!!' ,

Unfortunately I had to uninstall this game (I\'m sorry Train Depo!) Because it I already have loads of games. This is a good game and I also love the way that you get loads of money when you go to loads of stations at a park. The only thing is I managed to upgrade all of the stuff for the coaster and don\'t know what to do with it. Other than that, it\'s good',

      'You need to make it impossible to spend the purple gems currency in the game without first a confirmation. I have accidentally spent them 2 times on things I would never use them on after trying to save them up. I\'m not the only one. Please fix this! I love the game but that part really sucks and makes me want to quit. I will go back to 5 stars on everything if that is taken care of. Please include some kind of message interface. More gifts to send would be nice. There is so many neighbors but only 5 gifts to give!',
       'Good game, but after you go so far the game say something about the server, don\'t know if it\'s updating or what but after that you have to start all over. So don\'t spend money to advance, because you may get screwed like I did. Yet and still nice game to pass the time.',
       'Luv the game BUT once I hit level 30 I no longer get my boat that lets me sell what I need to.  Been stuck with special weapons for 3 days now and have to pay to hill anything even though I have them but no storage.  If I don\'t get my boat I am uninstalling.',
       'It\'s very addictive. I only started it to get some credits for my fantasy football league but I can\'t stop now. On lever 14 now, the pace is slowing down to encourage you to buy crystals but I\'m too tight to do that! So I have to wait 2 days to break up some rocks or build a new building. This game needs patience or it will get expensive!',
       'It\'s a good game but the warehouse upgrading is far too annoying.  Maybe you could allow the animals to graze on the grass so you don\'t need a constant supply of grains.  More of those flame jewels needed and the trolls are way too expensive.',

      'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, the number in the brackets becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'The gameplay is super fun till i got imposible mission "19 coin in one game" seriously? I\'ve try to complete this mission for  hours and always fail So in the next day I play to see if the mission has reset, and its not -_- i mean at least give us mission reset..',
       'Need to fix glitches in the lunges. Stunned when picking up a coin or going through it in to a enemy when instead of stopping. Random stuns even you have a successful strike. And you need to put more green and red guys in sooner. Also theres a glitch where the black dot turns grey and you strike but its too early.' ,

      'It has a lot of room for improvement, I hope to see more as I play.  Edit: from 5 stars to 3 stars, many problems from the start get ignored by devs due to rich kids pumping money into the game, still an OK game though.',
       'The same problem as previous person. Had 20 days left on Monthly card. Allowance has completely gone as they have introduced a new monthly card. Hopefully a mistake and not a scam. If scammed will be making chargeback of all payments !!',
       'This game is once sided. Players who have had the game for a while dominate the game so that new/weaker players can not advance. Really the only way you can stand a chance is buying packs  which still doesn\'t help as higher levels can attack and steal it. Finally the moderators are non existing and are often apart of the large groups attacking you. A terrible waste of time and money.',
       'Devs should add events or something where prizes has shields. Killing event is just too much a pain where bullying is tolerated. Universal shards are not universal as it covers only a few selected enabler shards...shady! Also sometimes or first log-in of the day it opens with phone media volume maxed and unchangable in-game, too loud. But overall not regreting installing this and will stay in phone for a long time.',
       'Im tired if I\'m being raped by many powerful player in the city, if only there is a balance system so only same lv player can attack... ( but i know its impossible )',
       'The game is great I enjoy playing it but I have two issues with it,   The chat censors are honestly a bit much, simple words that shouldn\'t be censored are and it\'s really annoying.  And the Grammer when taking the girls out on dates is so horrid I can barely understand what the actual heck is going on. I like reading the stories but I can\'t read if I can\'t understand' ,

      'Not bad for free, I am keeping it for now, to see if any improvements are made. Ads are ok, some a bit long. It would get 4 stars, but the bids of other opponents climb way too fast, also the auction prices generally start out too high as well, leaving you with almost no chance at a profit. The 7 energy per auction is a bit much. Please address these issues and you would have an enjoyable little game.',
       'I really like (love) this game, but 7 energy per level (out of 20 total) means I play 2 levels and then close the game. Sorry Tapps, wish I could like MORE and play MORE but you literally aren\'t letting me. Make level energy 3*-5* and I will give a 5 star rating. Till then, I\'ll stare at this app and click around to others that actually give me play time.',
       'It is very addicting! I am not getting paid, or getting a prize for this review. But I love it! It is sooo much fun, the gameplay is good, and its like your a character in the tv show, you go to storage units and actuion! This is also a great game for kids, I loved it and saw kids having fun, I thought it was also cool because, you can own a pawn shop! I recemend this game as a person, and you should try playing it to! By a 11 year old',
       'Makes you think & easy task to complete. Make money fast & especially love being able to obtain free gold! The variety of items spectacular! The pawn shop is a joke due to their request for the same item you can obtain in the locker is not worth purchasing. But I do appreciate that the pawn shop is only an option. Love this game! Easy download and simple strategy!',
       'not a bad game energy being quicker would be good. it word be nice if you could post links for life on your Facebook page more levels with a lot more higher end stuff to sell. needs to be done sooner rather than later before everyone gets bored and finds another game.',
       'I like the game, but some of the wait times for offers are kind of ridiculous though. I mean 1 day and 9 hours for your next offer makes the game go by super slow.  If you could shorten the offer times and make it a little easier to get gold,  I\'d rate the game 5 stars.' ,
