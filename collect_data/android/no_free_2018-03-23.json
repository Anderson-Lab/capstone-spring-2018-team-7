        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "This game is amazing. I've only ever played on mobile since it's hard to find time to play video games. I fell in love within the first game. This mobile version is so good especially being an early release. It only takes up 205mb of storage and runs amazing even on my Honor 7x which is a great phone but is known to be not the best with higher end gaming. I'm very impressed with this game and I'll keep playing it!",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

I tried repairing the game many times, reinstalled it too many times, but the same problem persists. Hope your team will look into the matter soon. Thank you!",

        "Ok. This is my THIRD review of this game and I'm getting a little upset. You put the clues back. Thank you very much for listening to us all. Now I have a new issue with the way you have changed this game. Before People Fun came along, when we put a word into the puzzle, sometimes we would see things like, \"Excellent!\" Or, \"Spectacular!\" pop out at us. I noticed this morning that you've taken away that feature. Why? This game was absolutely perfect when you came along. Why are you changing it? Who are you, that you would take a perfect game and then take away the best features? Those words popping out made the game more fun, and they encouraged us to keep going, and yeah, I don't mind saying it. They made us feel good about ourselves. It was a pat on the back. Who gets many of those these days? And you took that away from us. Now this game is dry and boring. Please put the pats on the back, back. Thank you."

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!"

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

        "I think this game has very good everything, the only thing about the game play is that they trick you kind of and it is hard to get Easter Eggs and stuff. Or when you jump off a train and there is one of those things you have to roll under but you have no time so the police catches you. Or maybe I am not good with those things. Yeah, probably just I am not good at this game.",

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

I really want the teleporter but I can't get enough coins and I've been playing for AGES! Otherwise, brilliant game always fun. Time consuming.Thank you!"

It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone"

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "Fantastic graphics, great controls, overall great game.  Recommended to my friends child.  Some tasks  (i.e., leveling up a character, waiting to clearing a curse, waiting to open a chest...) take too long and their is nothing to do while you wait.  Game has improved tremendously! Love the game, won't stop playing. Thank you Disney!",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game"

        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "Bright, colorful, addictive game play. Adorably happy graphics. Love \"Mr. Encouragement\", who exclaims \"sweet!\", & \"delicious!\" in his baritone voice. The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",

And one more thing, Can you explain why I have to wait over 2800 minutes for my next life? It's been 3 days and it went from 2800 minutes to 2300 minutes! Based on your stupid calculations each day is equal to 170 minutes? Give me your supports group email add and I will send you a screenshot!",

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",

        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall.",
        "I've been playing this game for a long time and love it. The only annoying Thing is that in some challenges. Even if I come first or second. It deduct point and I didn't even loose. Which is starting to become very annoying"

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",

Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",

Overall though, it is a great game.",

Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really?

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

        "More ads= more money, less stars= less money so you choose. Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I still love this game! However I have yet to change my mind about the fact that it takes longer to vote just for 3 stars at a time, than to actually design the max of 5 designs per day. Can you not increase stars won per vote? Can you not make designs brief even more compulsory as many designers dont follow the brief and you just end up losing votes because your design is too colourful or eclectic",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget."

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",

Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

Then it put like this.'gtg,## ##### ## overheat'.Seriously?!It censored that?!Wow.Just wow.So dumb.It also censored 'BOIIIII'."

        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",

Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",

The advertisements randomly open chrome browser windows with a fake virus scan saying \"your device is infected.\" Its ironic in that the software that you're prompted to download is terrible adware that an actual scanner might flag.  It's quite persistent too, happening only after I installed this. 30 second video ads midgsme and adbars that just so happen to pop up and hover where you have to click in-game.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",

Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",
        "Great time killer! On those nights I can't sleep, which is too often, this is the best app to turn my would be long night into an extremely short night. The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "This app is great for passing time, I also love how you can play offline. Its very addicting as well. The only downside is that there are way to many advertisements, I can't even play one song without there being an ad",
        "I mean the game is great! But all of these add-on power up stuff always being added ends up ruining the classic game for me. I love the good original design, no power-ups or anything too extra. I don't use them and find them annoying. It's a great time killer, and a real challenege.  But, as said before, the game is going too extra and I don't really like it.  Playing it is fun, the add-ons are not."

I wish you'd left in the settings so if we wanted the moving graphics we could have them. And, if not, the they'd be totally still and not distracting.  Make everyone happy that way. :,( Will be uninstalling this now.",
        "This game is stupid. It froze my phone n i  had to buy a new one for 4589 dollars. Dont waste ur time downloading this. If u give good comments n ur planning to play this game for the rest of ur life...... Well, in 2 days u will need a new phone n u will end up buying a new one. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME I REPEAT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME.",
        "It's nice to have a game that just passes some time when I need a break from things. Very simple but I enjoy trying to beat my high score. And no internet required which I really like",
        "I believe that we need a game that is simple, has no limit  of time to play, and you don't have to compare your score with others.  You just need to beat your own best score if you want. It's killing time in a portion that you chose.",
        "Simple (which I like) puzzle game, yet gets really challenging in strategy thinking as it progresses, which is good if you want a challenge and aren't already mentally tired from work, etc. Easy on the eyes and has really pleasant nature theme on the edges with a bird song loop. Hardly noticed any ads, which was also really nice. One of the BEST free games to take your mind off things!",

Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!",
        "I love this game there are so many games to play within.  One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn't give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star",
        "After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.",
        "Massive Pou fan, but after a short break from playing I find it fails to respond and crashes a lot- anyone any ideas why? I don't want to risk re-installing it in case I lose what I've already got!"

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",

The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",

        "I felt like this be could have so much potential! I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Actually it is much easy and had very less features. It is not like a competitive game. In 2hours I have nearly unlocked 31 levels.  Make it a tough one....graphics is good but lots & lots of ads, very annoying ! And add scores there rather than medals",
        "This is a very fun game, even though the screen freezes almost every time I go directly to the next level. I have to close it completely and then reopen it - Please fix this then I will rate it 5 stars.",
        "Fun playing. Passes some idle time. Habit forming. How much more do I need to say before get something free? Lol...",
        "Meh!!! It not what i expected I'd like to do the training but also the 1 on 1 competition. If any1 know of a pool app. Hit me up.",
        "Great game....way too many ads. I would pay for an ad free version since the ads annoy me so much that I'm going to wind up uninstalling it."

        "Overall this game is really fun.. just that I'm from SG and my friend from TH we were planning to play together but we realise it's both different server we can't play together.. Is there anyway for you AOV team to make a server for all SouthEastAsia so many will all be happy... sorry for any inconvenience caused.. appreciate for you team to try your best. Without you guys we work get to experience such good gameplay. Thank you 🤗😘",
        "This game is awesome! And more importantly, it's waaaay better than the cancer graphics of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. This game needs strategy and teamwork, unlike MLBB, it's a very easy game that doesn't require brains. MLBB has a lot of cancer players, trashtalkers, and stupid players. Although, you can never remove those kind of players but at least they stay in MLBB, and smarter people plays this. This is the best MOBA on smartphones! Kudos!",
        "I seriously love this game and got me hooked to MOBA games. One quirk though, I got the skin for Astrid which looks like Arthuria from Fate Stay Night. One suggestion is to make her sword glow gold instead of red to make it match more to Arthuria (Saber). Thanks! Keep up the good work!",
        "I'm done. At least balance the matchmaking system and determine a players skill level. I was on Gold 3 then back to Silver 1 again? Wow Tencent. Good job making an enjoyable game, but this won't make me say that this MOBA is fine for me. Fix the issues first.",
        "update I wonder why game app like R.O.S and this moba AOV need a huge update. Please make this game using abit amount of size from before & please make game more balance. Player with low connection please dont make them didn't join any rank match or what.. they always make our game really bad",
        "Better than ML. Honestly, I play all sorts of Moba (or any video game), but this one really is different.  This game has issues, no argument with that. But when you compare it to \"Mobile Legends: Bang Bang\", you really see the difference. This one has top-notch graphics that I can probably compare to VG or PC Mobas. This game has awesome gameplay as well. There are almost overpowered heroes, but there are always heroes that counter them. ML looks like sht compared to this game.  The only downside that I can see is that, the controls are kinda off. Probably with an update, they can fix that. Will give five stars once that happens."

        "Great game with fun objectives that keep it challenging until level 15.  Only issue with it is that ive recently lost all.my gems due to some sort of bug and now i dont really want to continue playing just to get back to 500 gems to experience something other than sky summit.",
        "I like it and it is a good game, except now I have no sound and the videos do not leave the screen so I can spin the wheel. The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",
        "I have enjoyed this game for a couple of years wirh no problems. The only thing I can complain about is earning so many coins and jems and not having anything to buy with them such as new characters and powerups. It's a good hand eye game.",
        "Ok I'm mad I got a new phone. There is no way to save progress. I lost 1,000 gems and 2 million coins. This is BS. They should make it so u can connected thru Facebook like most of the other games. Get it together temple run 2",
        "I abosulutly love this game. It won't get a 5 star though because I have had 4 different coin skins get taken away from me and those were actually my favorites. Idk if it was a glitch or I didn't do something but plz tell me what it is",
        "The blazing sand map is really boring. Only 3 different location there. But looks same all the entire run. Make some free space. It is very boring to run in sand all the time. Make variation like Frozen Shadows atleast. Add some location. Make some variations."

        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you're in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "Update: so I've been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They're twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you're unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.",
        "The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks",
        "People have low requirements nowadays. This game doesn't deserve a 4.4 rating. It feels good as long as I stay in the menu (even with the weird japanese mascot) but once the game loads it gets horrible. The camera angles are terrible, the cars feel like toys in the overscaled world, the car's softshadow is terribly aligned and the physics simulation is just mediocre. The whole game is just a mediocre clone of Asphalt 8, I don't understand why people choose an inferior copy instead of the original one..."

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

I also recorded myself playing because I would live to show this game up to the world and give a review. Really enjoy it and think it deserves to be spread out",
        "wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven't! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there's the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it's long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁",
        "This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous\"Candy Crush\" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can't seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can't stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.",
        "I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it's so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You're clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I'm only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.",
        "Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.",
        "It's a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I'm going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??"

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

        "This game is sufficient. It's just a generic tower defense game. Honestly, it's too easy so couple that without much innovation and yeah, it's okay, but nothing to write home about. I already uninstalled this game because it doesn't stand out from any other tower defense game that I have ever played. Again, it's not a bad game, but it's not great either. Also, with a name like \"game of warriors\" how could this game not be just a bland clone?",
        "Fun, entertaining defense RPG kind of game, with simple mechanics, but loads of fun nonetheless. Easy to play, progress and have fun without having to spend real cash too. That's always a giant plus for me, as many developers these days make their games either pay to win, or pay to progress ie, pay to have or get any sort of fun out of the game. A big thank you to the developers for not doing that with this game!  10/10 -Lots of fun, not pay for fun, lots and lots of hours of enjoyment, and nice graphics and sound design.",
        "My account disappeared after I uninstalled the game because it wasnt letting me in and i now have to start from the beginning... Ive tried loading from the cloud but I receiving a message saying there is no previous save data... Is there a way to get my account back as I spent money on there?",
        "Have just played for a short time and I find this game quite challenging & addictive. Very good gameplay and not $$ greedy. If you dont have $ you're still given the chance to raise coins to upgrade your troop. However, you need to have a lot of patience",
        "The game is fun however the ads are a little too frequent. If the ads were cut back on some I would happily increase my review rating as other than that I'm really enjoying the game. Just keep in mind you will be watching or closing an ad after every wave to every other wave.",
        "Pretty fun game. Good time killer. Not much of a challenge. The only downfall is an ad after almost every wave which can be very annoying. Most of the time you get a reward from watching. Loads of upgrades to choose from also. 4/5 for me 👌"

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic."

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "This game is very nicely done. Its a genius concept except the fact that u catch zombies to make it into something is really gross. I would preffer if you could lower the pri e of the drone a bit so that there would be more play time rather than waiting play. Overall this game is superb",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested."

        "Great game the reason of why the one star is no matter what if you delete the app or get a new phone it doesn't save. Not to your Facebook account, or Google play game and has problems with it's server. Why any one would spend money on this game until they could at least save stuff is beyond me.",
        "MY STORY OF HUNGRY SHARK  I've been playing hungry Shri since years and I reached my tiger shark.... suddenly it got updated and I lost all my progress and returned to the first level of reef shark...I was so disappointed and uninstalled the game after a few months I reinstalled it and while playing I saw the cloud save and clicked it.....I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD RETURN TO MY PROGRESS....I enjoy playing it and I love the new background and updates  Best wishes- A hungry shark fan",
        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "It's mindless fun and the soft gore while eating a human is fun. The underwater scenes are visually pleasant. I also like the feature that warps you to the North Pole once a day. The random vortexs that throw you into space are also a really fun feature."

Secondly, new maps and modes once in a while would make it perfect and something to look forward to. All other things are great though. Hope you keep these things in mind and improve the game to be perfect.  Player: God Country:Nepal",
        "Worst game. I had log in to this game and my rank was 29 but now 22 I am having players with high ranks and they killed me again and again. You have to fix that problem that a low ranker play with the same rank player otherwise you will loose everything like me. In the beginning it was good game but now it becomes more hard to play with high rankers. Plzz do something otherwise nobody will like it.",
        "I dont know you will see my review but i would like to say that this game is really amazing. Infact i dont have words to express how good is your game. Tip: just remove gas and mine in CTF because many player put this two things on the flag and it become hard to capture the flag. Hope you find my suggestions worth it.",

Please make it easier to rank like give us more exp.  Thanks",

Letting hackers in the game shows that ur security is too weak, u can't stop them. Atleast learn from others games like coc whose security doesn't allow any hackers and if found they r banned asap. And the most important thing hackers r not profiting u. Its stopping the gamers to buy pro pack, coz its better to hack then use pro.",

        "After the latest update, I've only gotten one set of daily quests which populated right after the update. After that, I haven't received any additional daily quest where I can win some gems. Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",
        "Mind Blowing Game..But Could You Guys Please Include \"Voice Chat\" It will Make the game more Awesome.. Its so tough To Contact With Team Mates. In chat box By typing..Please..see in thus matter.. #Devlorpes"

        "Castle Clash I love the game so much..feel like a blast..Since I played this so much better have daily sign-in and free gems😊i wonder if you could add more Hero And Upgrade All To Level Maximum To 500..Please Up More Level Until Level 500 hero😊So Addicted..",
        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

        "I would have gave a 5 but at times I would come in second and then get a trophy that says 3 place when clearly I finished 2nd and there has been times when I will come inblast at the finish line and then I would get the gold or silver trophy. Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",
        "Love the game but cmon guys, how many times are the race ranking going to get messed up. Finish first... But says you were second, second but now I finish third, third but wait... Fourth. Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",
        "This game decided to forget my vehicle upgrades but not the races I won meaning it was impossible to win money to build up vehicles again.  Don't waste your time.",
        "Add a friends tab to see if our friends our online as well as ability to send friend request. Clan tabs are very inconvenient so fix them as well plz. Over all a very good game.",
        "Very misleading ad for it, showing two helmeted players leaning and \"steering\" with their tablets.  This falsely implies that steering is done by tilting tablet.  Truth: steering done by tapping arrows on screen, very hard to control."

        "Hasn't even been 10 seconds into the game before it shut down 🤣 - I thought it would be different for me as I have the S8+. Obviously NOT. The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn't much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.",
        "Let's be honest here. The concept was very creative and unique, but the game was very poorly designed. The slide is not smooth and   feels very unstable, I wasn't able to enjoy playing the game. The graphics are very low and the game itself is slow. Apart from that the idea was very well thought of but I feel you should have added more time and professionalism into the whole design, the game has potential.",
        "One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don't really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...",
        "I really like this app but the the amount of ads are crazy! Wayyy too many. On a good note, the personalisation. I really like the different range of balls and the night time vortex, where everything stands out, and is all black. The trails are really neat too! Although the ball is quite sensitive when dodging around the obstacles. It is still great! I got a score of 104 on my second go! I'd definitely recommend this app! Also i have the samsung galaxy s4 so you can definitely 8nstall this if you have the same phone as me!😊",
        "It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.",
        "It's hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I'll be doing fine but it'll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I'd love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks."

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "I've been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment ''Wow, update, ok''. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they've done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can't just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg."

On tablet i am loged in with a google paly account, when i login to same account on my phone it doesnt ask me to download other chapters and i dont have any items or achivements. Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",
        "Not the master. But I had got with the achievement \"thaught the teacher\". After defeating hermit now I am used to magic. Only in few minutes I can earn money and upgrade\u200b my gear. Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "I have been playing this game for over 3years now and I know how far I have gone with the game... Just lost my phone and I got a new one and... Google Play can't restore Me to my previous level.. Please fix because I can't just start playing the game over from the beginning.. Thanks"

Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",

Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",

        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

        "It is a fun offline game that dose not have beautiful graphics but they appeal to the eyes the only complaint i have with the game is when it gives you the opportunity to continue your game by watching an ad you cant click the back button to automatically bring you back to the main menu. I hope you make the main menu button apear immediately or allow you to click your back button to go to the menu of the game but other than that AMAZING game!",

        "I love the game, but you need to create more game modes. Yeah sure the bosses are nice and all but they get really boring after playing them over and over and over again. You need to liven up your game with different game modes/types to keep people coming back for more knife madness!",

I was back at stage 1 on all my challenges, and I had none of my knifes. I am very disappointed, I really liked this game until this happened. I hope ketchapp and estoty fixes this issue.",
        "Game lags in the most critical moments, I've lost so many times just because of lag that happens unexpected. Throws the knife into the next knife even if there is plenty of space. Fix that and I will give for sure 5 star rating."

But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",

There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",

The game itself is a lot of fun. I enjoy it a lot and its great time killer. But NOT getting what I PAID FOR does not make me a happy customer. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed.",
        "Way too many ads. Every two games you get 30 seconds of advertisment. At one point an ad popped up during my game and made me lose. Played this for 5 minutes and uninstalled, dont even bother to download the game.",
        "I always play games with music in the background and while playing this game my music would be constantly shut off because of the ads, I don't mind the ads themselves, just the fact that it constantly interrupts other sounds playing on the system is very irritating. Gave you 2 stars for a nice game, didn't play a lot though so couldn't tell you more.",
        "This game is fun to play, however, I hate how on every Voodoo app that doesn't require Wi-Fi to play, the only way to stop being bombarded with 5000000000 ads, I have to turn my Wi-Fi and data off, otherwise the game play is ruined. This is a problem that really needs to be addressed. I read the reviews before downloading, so I know it's a consistent problem.  FYI, if you wanna play without all the ads, just turn your data and Wi-Fi off. It's a nuisance, but so are the ads.",
        "Just listen to all of the reviewers and don't download this app! I got about thirty seconds of game-play, then an ad popped up. The ad lasted about a minute, and after that, my phone started glitching out.",
        "Gravity is meant to work like gravity. The \"alien\" isn't the centre of gravity. It's meant to fall SIDEWAYS not directly AT YOU. I would understand if you were playing as a planet traversing through space, but you're not. This game is ass."

        "Easily my favourite android game. Hits all the right spots. While Blitz followed the runner style coins model and see how much you can travel, I am glad that in this game they ditched that over-used android model. I appreciate there vision, it's a complete different game from Blitz. Various fictional cars and characters that seem original inspirations and charming in their own way. The tracks have a theme. Boss races under every championship. There is so much of soul in the game. And you can adjust resolution, add colour correction, adjust many other effects. Words don't do justice here nor does 5/5.",
        "Amazing! I play this game daily and I never got bored. Just one thing: other drivers don't use special abilities which does not makes it challenging. Now since I have completed this game once, I would expect devs to add new levels and characters. I have an idea for a new character. Please contact me if I can help you",
        "The controls take some getting used to. But for a Mario-Kart-like experience for mobile, this game gets my #1 rating. Feels more like Diddy Kong racing to be honest though. Can be played when you only have enough a few minutes, or grinded for awhile until you run out of tickets.",
        "Imagine Mario Kart but on mobile with a few tweaks. That's what this game is and what a great game it is. So much variety and features that makes this game unique. Vector Unit  did an excellent job and this game deserves some credit for how great it is. I'm telling you, if you like Mario Kart, Crash Racing, Sonic All Stars or even Angry Birds Go, you're gonna love this game.",
        "The game just restarted as if I never played it. Just went through the tutorial as a new player. I have been playing for months. Not sure what happened! Can't sync it with google games. I do know I was playing and mid game my phone battery died. I recharged it and went to the game and went default on me.",
        "Second Beach Buggy game, this one you race opponents with some fun, but dirty tricks. A lot of reviews are unfair, just need to figure out strategies. Needs a few new tracks to update it a bit! I cleared it out 4 times & started over, love it! Played everyday for over a year, great fun. Needs a sequel, hope they didn't give up, there is no updates on their site. BBR-2, yea baby!"

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout",
        "Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...",
        "It would be great if the control's could be moved. The I keep hitting the fire button when I'm not making to. A couple of glitches but otherwise a cool way to kill time. The developer is on the right track."

        "3 stars with note! I copied my review for Classic Drum to be used as review for this app &gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes lag occured during play. Sensitivity needs improvement. Need manual placement for all kits. I am left handed. This default kits layout is not a joy. Distance between toms, snare and kick need a bit space. Also need space for the hi hat and tambourine. Sound is okay. I used both of these apps.",
        "This application was filled with unecessary and nerve-warcking advertisements. I do not recommend this app to anyone, and if you are interesting in drumming, just buy a real or electric kit rather than playing this garbage.",
        "This app was absolutley perfect before the latest update, it was very responsive and i could drum along to songs on spotify and it would hit 99% of what i tapped. After the update if i play too fast or sometimes just randomly, the sound cuts out on some taps, very annoying when you're trying to keep a beat. What happened!?",
        "I'm never one to comment but this is fantastic!  I needed a few  percussion samples and thought I'd give an app a try..  I wasn't very optimistic on getting something realistic and easy to use. Was I wrong... I'm totally satisfied with this app and then some!",
        "Very good app for great time pass!But some time pass is the way of earning money and fame! There is an YOUTUBER named \"Mobile drummer\" from india,uploads video on youtube with the help of this app and earns a lot ,his some videos are 1 million crossed .",
        "The app is fantastic. But it stops working after a few minutes. It starts to lag and the tracks randomly start and stop. It's fantastic but only when it works."

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",

It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved",
        "I installed the game. I was enjoying it then suddenly it stoped working giving me an error message of \"license stoped working\". I uninstalled it and will try to install it. I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",

And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

        "The game is awesome and i Love it.. Much more fun if to put some emoji or words sign like Good Luck, well play and many more.. And Please no chat column.. That just wasting time.. Thanks.. Keep up the good work..👍👍👍☝",

        "I absolutely LOVE this app!!! It's an ultimate best time killer! I actually spent entire nights just playing this app. Lol.   Just one problem. It crashed and started lagging when I moved it to my phone's SD card. Uninstalled and now reinstalling to fully fix the problem. Will give this 10 stars if I could. ❤❤❤  Update: I always get stuck while playing. Please FIX!!!",
        "I need help, reached out using fb and email but got no response. Hope this will caught their attention",
        "I've contacted the Devs several times. They even mark my comments on FB as spam! This is so frustrating! All we wanted was for me and my husband and some of our friends to be able to play this together. We had it connected to FB and such. But we still don't appear to the \"buddies\" list. Why can't you help us with a simple concern?! I've sent you guys several messages on messenger and you've been ignoring me. Just let us know if you CAN help us or NOT, so we can just uninstall the game."

        "Thanks j park. I was just confused that which game to play. All were bad. Finally i thought that ur game can be  good so i installed it and played it.so nice it is!!!love it . First i thought playing  this game can be hard because it has so many buttons and how to play it but i did not had any choice and i played ur game. I felt like never deleting  it even i have completed this game . I understood this game by pressing the help button.  I have become  an expert in this without any friends. I have the hulk friend only but i use it rarely.because of playing alone I am stuck in level 19 but i will try. If not possible I wl use hulk. Thank u veryyyyyyyyyyyyyy much!!!!!!☺☺😊😃.i just have a question to you that when can my player become hulk. Only when we buy game money or any other way?????😞😐please tell fast",
        "Its a amazing game but i have one suggestion could u plz in the new anger of stick add cust charesters to be able to to be able to make your own charecter using a custom catolog and for the cuatom items not to cost any coins or jems or anythinf and for it to be free so u can just have all these things to add to your charecter and u can just get them without paying coins jems or real money.",
        "A nice game and I have unlock the last mega weapon it helps so much but weapons are not last long but I have too many so I can change the weapons when 1 ends yo yo a awesome game and J-Park the game server please please please please make anger of stick 7 and 8 I want to see the game and play yo yo a awesome game epic game awesome what should I say now a nice game yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo awesome yo yo",
        "Its good but the cost of reloading ur guns and weapons are way too high.playing in single player  gives you very low amount of money so its pretty hard the cost of stuff should be lowered",
        "Pretty simple and fun and you can play as much as you want, instead of an energy system. I wish there was a multiplayer zombie mode, unless there is and I just can't find it. Great game"

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than."

        "I absolutely love this game. The music is good, the challenges are really fun and... well, challenging. It has taken me several days of being asked by the game if I would like to review it because I was having so much fun and didn't want to stop playing long enough to review. But here you have it. This game is well deserving of a great review. I'm going to go back to the game now so I can keep on rushing.",
        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "Minus another star because it's now glitchy and no longer gives daily bonus. I'm on challenge 89 and the point accumulation is taking forever. Minus one star because the ad at the bottom gets in the way while playing. I'll be on a good run and barely graze the ad space and it stops the game and ends the run. Very frustrating.",
        "I'm obsessed with this game. It's not just playing to beat your best score. There are challenges that you can beat as you play and it makes it okay to have a bad run sometimes because you can still beat the challenge lol. Not frustrating, just so much fun. Not sure if my review makes sense, just play this game ok."

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "Good overall, although I have some gripes about the stunlocking when you're ragdolled on the ground and you can't recover. Also, at the fight with Xiang Tzu in the tournament, after I win the game blurs to blue as it is supposed to, but just stay there and doesn't show my rewards. When I restart the app the game then resets me to before I fought Xiang Tzu.",
        "I have been playing this game for past few months and i just love the game. Its so addictive but today when i updated it, it has become a nuisance. Every time i defeat a opponent in a mission the game halts after \"you win\". I tried this with other missions as well but things didn't work. Please fix this bug.",
        "I want give this  game 0 star but unfortunately there is no option for that..... I had  defeated the chapter 2 last \"itu\" But whenever i defeated him this game will hang and right now i am so frustrated because coders of this game don't even know how to code this game  And i am going to uninstall this game and i will tell every friend of mine to uninstall this game and never ever install this game again. If this company left any dignity . Then this company will fix this today. If not than go hell with your self I have installed the recent update and the game itself hang. Shame on you guys You have millions of customer for this game and your doing this type of silly mistakes............",
        "Having same problems as some others after latest update game freezes after wining fight and no rewards show up so have to close the game and do it again. Seem to be stuck in the same cycle so might aswell not play til update fixes problem",
        "The update destroyed everything.. now when I win a match, the game crashes. Can't finish the missions. I tried again and again, but still crashes. It going pretty well before the update. Why was the update anyway.. to make us noobs?"

        "Addictive!!! The characters have so much PERSONALITY. The graphics are awesome. I like playing with Chumbot Ogie!! . It's like playing with a real person. Alot of FUN! I decided to purchase the game and get rid of the Ads. Well worth it!! This is the best word game out there!! I love watching the characters go into the store to shop and when they come out they have on different costumes. Some are so funny. I just sit watch them come out sometimes. One about every 15 seconds or so. I crack up, HILARIOUS! Better than plain Scrabble. Love, love, love IT! Please, don't change anything and mess it up.",
        "Great fun, very challenging & a sleek new design.  It's different to Scrabble or WWF in a good way. You can quickly see if you've made a word, plus you get extra points for long words. Lots of players, so you never go short of a game, & now there's a quick play mode too.",
        "I am giving one star because I thought this was a game that went at my own pace. I have a busy life so I thought that was perfect. But today I opened the app and 3 of the current games I was playing and in the lead I might add said I lost and the game just ended for no reason🤷\u200d♀️😠😩 I don't understand why. I am so upset about this I dont even want to play anymore😡 It's going to go on my game record and it isn't fair😒😒",
        "The new update, where you get ads that blare at you for 5 sec before you can close them? Not cool.  Update... they are gone!! Thx!!  I have another request - is it possible to keep track of the number of times someone scores a 7 letter bingo, or a best word?  I would love to see those numbers in my dashboard too! Thx.",
        "The items to accessorize seriously needs to be updated, which would only make me spend more. All of the knightly garb is not that interesting for everyone. The hair choices are clearly geared for white people, and more food  needs to be offered (mexican, asian, african, etc) because  I love to change all of the time. Lastly, we should be able to sort and organize our accessories so they are easier to see and select - like a real closet!",
        "This game is great,  especially if you aren't so good at making words because it helps by highlighting and using the stars. The only thing I would change is to make a version where the boards are random. Scatter the bonus tiles around to make it a little more interesting."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",

I've been playing pretty much from the first version and have yet to find a fuel tank for my motorcycle. the developers either just don't listen to the people playing the game and address the problems people have with the game or don't care. with every update it's becoming more and more obvious they're more concerned with how to get more money out of players that are willing to spend it."

        "Not bad. It's a well put together game with easy-to-use controls and enemy randomization so you never know who's over the next hill. I couldn't get past the clipping issues. My tank would randomly get stuck while reversing into valleys.",
        "Hill Climb meets Tank Wars. Simple but fun time-burner. You can upgrade your tank with in-game coins. Purchase option available but then you don't get to enjoy the challenge. Grind it out and earn those upgrades. Enjoy!",
        "Move forward, flip over and die Move backward, flip over and die Fire the canon, flip over and die Hit by another canon, flip over and die Ram a tank, flip over and die Rammed by another tank, flip over and die Sit perfectly still, flip over and die.  Terrible, terrible controls.  Edit: I'm happy to say they removed the Flip and Die feature and now the game is quite enjoyable. Well worth playing!",
        "Very pay to win and matchmaking isn't great.  Matches new players against players with tons of upgrades.  I know that's a common tactic to encourage those new players to buy the better tanks with cash, but it just made me remove the game.",
        "Simplistic game which makes it fun.  Build up tank quickly with easily earned \"coins\" Computer or vs a random player  Wish they'd add player chat/trash talking for more player interaction.  Fun game. 4 days & loving it"

I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers",

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

I've reinstalled twice already and I can no longer use the names I wanted. Even if I force close it when it gets stuck. The cam just freezes on black screen when i open it again.",
        "Well this game is good. But it can get pretty old, its still fun to play tho. However its very laggy when there is to many players, and I think it would be cool that the players could be able to chat with each other.",
        "The game is somewhat enjoyable, but it gets a bit repetitive since that death match is the only playable game mode in quick play. It would be nice to add CTF in it or create new ideas for game modes.",
        "Please fix this whenever I go on quick play my phone restarts, it doesn't work on other apps only on this one, I'm really irritated on how this is always disturbing game play",
        "My suggestion is that you add a First person view especially When building, cause it's really hard. 10/10 ❤️",
        "Can u add first person on the build mode cause its  hard to face the thing that you're building for example up to down its really hard pls add and keep the game great!"

        "Really enjoy this game but its very hard to do well unless you pay real money to buy extras! There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "The app is really good. It's addictive. But, I really feel they should give out cash or diamonds more easily. If we could earn diamonds or cash for watching a video then it would be great. Cause it takes time for the looks to get voted and until then we cannot play and wait for the diamonds. It's kinda sad. Hope they'll look into this.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5☆"

Often going back to previous levels needing three stars for best advantage. Only problem I have is with cloud save I can't log in successfully and you must exit game to save data to your phone leave any other way all current data is gone. lOVE the game Good job.",
        "Well executed game.  Items are there only for quick power freaks.  Looking forward to seeing the add one for the game.   PS- The English in the game isn't great and could use improvement.  It doesn't affect gameplay,  just a bit nerve wracking,  😉",
        "Way better than most running shooters I've played but I could do without the 55 action point limit. I just want unlimited play. The action points only allow you about 30 minutes of gaming then you have to wait for it to build up of lengthy amounts of time. Otherwise really fun.",
        "The only way i would give this game 5 stars if there was an option to walk around instead of pressing an arrow to jump from cover to cover that ends up breaking cause your enemy's keep shooting at it. You bring all these amazing features but you take away the most important feature in any shooting game: walking around and taking cover where you like.",
        "You'll know right away if the game is bad just by reading the dialogues. If the English is bad, chances are the game is bad too. I have proven this many times already, and I know many other players have too.",
        "Its not a bad game, its actually just like the rest of the shooters on google play, which is point and shoot type of games like Zombie Frontier. I bet this game would be a lot more fun if you could walk around instead of just sitting In one place which is my only complaint. But otherwise overall this game is rather a bit fun if you are looking for a time killer."

I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",

        "The stories are really interesting and it is hard to out down the phone once you got into one of the story. 😂😂 Although I really do wish that it is more easier to get the diamond but overall I totally recommend it!!  Keep it up the good work!  😊",
        "I loved it so much😍😍",
        "Can anyone tell me what SNS is?",
        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",

Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

After 2 weeks playing, you'll start to see empty cities in several nations. The dev nees to stop opening new server and start to merge the old servers. If not, this game won't last long.",

It's got worst after S17 open.. this game is the same as Loong Craft just different skin. But at least loong craft server is much more sturdy. Please DON'T tell me to check connection or reinstall the game, because I already did it 3 times, connection it's perfectly fine, cuz all my other game I play run just fine.",
        "The game was amazing. Have a good quality in terms of graphics and smooth controls. However, I encountered problem in my account. After I reach LEVEL 35 my character was totally gone and advices me to create a new one. Please help me regarding with my problem. Any reply are very much appreciated. I will change my ratings after I recovered my character. Thank you.",
        "I really love this game. But my only problem here is the  issues of so many servers thats why other players wants to go to other servers to start playing again. Instead of focusing to the last server they had. When saying that the server is FULL it doesnt mean that all character here is active, when the new server is open everyone choose to  go there. What will happen to the other nation on the old server??? Some are ghost nation, coz everybody quits becoz of new server. Please fix this issues. Thank you.  Please bring back my 6000 power loss on my character on s25"

I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",

Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",

If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",

Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",

It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

It happens almost every other game, sometimes a few (5+) games in a row. For most games I would just uninstall after a while and find something else, but I really enjoy playing. Hopefully that gets fixed, I saw a lot of other reviews saying the same thing. ~Lagging",
        "The game is actually really fun, when it works... But it's so temperamental...  Games  disconnect regularly.  My other big issue is that there isn't a global leaderboard, Google play integration, achievements, or an easy way to start a game with friends.  On a side note the English translations are pretty poor, but it doesn't take away from the fub.!",
        "Crashes way too much. Fun, then crashes.  Glitches everywhere.  Multiple functions of game play do not work, like \"Firestorm Arena\". (It spawns me alone, always without opponents.)  Awful app construction, fun concept.  *(This review is not... \"for an older version\". It is for the current glitchy as hell dysfunctional version. It has been dysfunctional for months and will be for months after this post. This is a current review for the current version of the game.)*",
        "The game is really good. I'm really enjoying it but after playing for about 15 to 20 minutes it just quits, like it's crashing. This usually happens when I'm first place and level 17 or so. Really frustrating as it means I've gotta start again. Will happily increase to 5 stars once this has been resolved. Great game other than that!",
        "I personally love this game. The controls are fluent, and it is all around a good game. 😀 But, for some reason, whenever I go into the battle Royal game, it just instantly kills me! Sometimes it works, but most of the time it just kills me straight away. Maybe it's me... Idk other than that, great game!"

Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

They stayed in contact, gave a time that an update should be in place, and even compensated me with a nice sorry for the inconveniences package. Which I wasn't expecting or requesting in anyway. So great game and better customer support than most other mobile developers",

        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!",
        "There are so many good things to list about this game. First, the graphics are extordinarily beautiful. And how much this game can relax you is AMAZING! When I play this, I swear my stress is gone. This game is never stressful. I find it amazing how satisfying this game is. I also love how realistic this game it is. The veiw and echoing is what really make up this game. Every sound is perfect for the setting. You need to download this NOW!",
        "Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.",
        "Great game, but premium is almost a requirement. The game itself is great, with an uber-cool, never-seen-before concept of smashing glass with metal balls in mysterious dimensions. The only problem is that getting premium is almost a requirement if you want to do well in the game. You can't continue the level once you die without paying. I would rate this game five stars if it weren't for this.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!"

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",

Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I love the game, it's so addictive! Some of the levels are confusing, but most are super simple and super fun! One thing that is a little bit of a downer is how every time you want to play a new round you have to watch a 30 second add , which gets old when you want to play a lot, but don't want to pay for add free. But I would highly recomend this to anyone",

Extra blades that just appear and sit in a corner of the screen.  Ads wont count down, and entire app needs to be restarted to get back to home page. Also have the app freeze just after I enter games and lose all the starfruit/gold apples it cost to play, but never even got to open that game. Super pissed and dissapointed.",

I will level up, get my Sword and dojo of Choice then two weeks later for no  it is gone.  I have Stopped playing because I am tired of Starting over on a saved linked account ever couple of weeks.",
        "I'm a great fan of ur game but I don't know why I'm not getting any dojos or blades from daily challenge. I got 1 dojo and 3 blades from daily challenge after that I played 15 days continueosly but I got only 5000 star fruit but no blades or dojos. Please solve this problem I really want to give 5 stars for this awesome game. 😞😞😢😢😩😩",

        "Of course I love the game, but I can't get my free star fruit because the videos aren't playing. I can't redeem my free golden apples because of the videos not playing. I've lost out on more than 300 star fruit and 100 golden apples. Please fix this.",
        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime."

I asked them if I uninstalled and then cleanly reinstalled it, would I have my gun that I PAID FOR. That was the last of the conversation. Would have recommended this to anyone until now. For 3 weeks I have tried to reach them and have gotten nothing. So, HELL NO, I would NOT recommend this to anyone.",
        "Game is fun. A lot of oppurtunity to get gems if you have patience.. gameplay is really good. However too many ads.. if you offer the oppurtunity for people to watch ads to get gems then why throw in all the extra random ads that we are forced to watch? Also i sometiimes get ads appear that you cant get rid of unless you close the game and reopen it. For trhis i give it one star.. get rid of the ads and ill give it 5",
        "I think that when I deserve a reward for doing one of the free gem missions, like downloading a game and starting it.. that I should get my gems. Also I completed a daily task and did not receive my grenade. But other than that I love this game.. just needs those things to work! And maybe if I could get those things it would be nice!",
        "I have did a lot of promotions to get free gems and didn't get any! I think it's wrong that I have wasted my time on the false advertising for gems. If y'all can't honor the time people put into to get the gems... Then y'all need to take it down! Other than that, the game is fun",
        "Great game, but the offer wall with the gems sucks. I paid for an offer and did not receive my gems. Sent email to the app producer and they suggested i contact other people. The problem has still not been corrected. So beware of offer wall. Dont waste your money!",
        "Usually don't\"pay\" for games. Made a $9.99 in game purchase, went through. Started playing gun and upgrades along with remaining gems are now gone, after only two minutes of playing!! RIP off!! Took money and screwed me!! Will contact my bank if not remedy. Theft of service!! UPDATE 3/8/18 STILL NO REMEDY FROM DEVELOPER! WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY A D GAME GLITCHES AND SHUTS OFF TAKING ANY PROGRESS! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! UPDATE 3/18/18  STILL NO WORD OR REMEDY FROM DEVELOPER!!! SCAM!!!!!"

        "Too much advertising.  After watching an advertisement between games, a pop up screen of an advertisement will pop up right in the middle of your game and stop you from playing causing you to lose your focus.  Also the control are horrible their is no tapping just dragging.  The dragging is unresponsive sometimes and will cause customers to leave or burgers to burn. Plus side they give a lot of diamonds away.",
        "It's a great game, but the ads are everywhere. It's kind of ridiculous.  Love it to pass the time, though. It's hard to drag the order to each person. And I think it would be helpful if the wait time increased each time you add one of their items on their list.",
        "No reasonable way to upgrade or get good scores without purchasing or watching alot of ads for jewels. After a certain level you need to upgrade equipment and food to get faster but they require alot of jewels, so in essence you'll be only getting 1 maybe 2 stars out of 3 per level if you don't get the uprades. Deceptive, malicious,  uninstalling.",
        "It is  interesting and most of all i like to make the burgers. But the customers are impatient to wait and i hope at least you can update to make them wait a little longer then the game will be much enjoyable.",

        "It was a good game,  but I can't access the other levels.  I've reached out to the developer twice.  I've spent money on purchasing gems,  so I'd really like to find out how to move forward."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon. It's a good game but you've been warned..."

        "In love with it every second I used it. Have been missing it on my Coolpad Note 3 due to certain glitches with my copy of Warriors Orochi & Orochi 2. The MALI-T720 really sucks. But loving it again on my Lenovo Z2 Plus with Snapdragon 820 and Vulkan. Love the fast forward key, it makes me go LOL sometimes in games. Soon going to buy the Gold Version now as I have a better compatible device. Thank you dev for such a pleasurable claasic experience. Love ya. 😃",
        "After the recent update, the app is crashing quite frequently. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. But Vulcan support is appreciated, it seriously improves frame rate and audio, plus the texture looks nicer too. It's a blessing I can play persona 3 on my phone. Haven't tried many other games though. Will edit and update the score once the game crashes are improved. Lastly, thank you to the developer for this amazing emulator.",
        "This has continued to be an amazing app! The ability to run most PSP games flawlessly on my phone is incredible. My PSP broke a while back and I haven't had the money to buy the system again. I had missed playing my favorite PSP games. Now I still can! I highly recommend this app! I also recommend trying Dead Head Fred on it! Fantastic PSP title!",
        "I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (yes the best-of-the-best). And as soon as I selected Vulkan, instead of OpenGL all my games like Midnight Club 3, Midnight Club LA and even Gran Turismo works SUPER FAST AND ON AMAZING 5x PSP resolution. The only thing disappointing is that the emulator doesn't work full screen. *PLEASE ADD FULL SCREEN SUPPORT FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 8*. BEST PSP EMULATOR.",
        "Awesome app.... loved it... But due to 2 problems I am not able to play the best of the best psp games like G O W and Assassin's Creed, etc. 1. Calibration is not working. The default calibration is only in place even after calibraling it from many different angles. There is no change to the tilt even after calibration. 2. multitap compatibility in OnePlus 3t. I am not able to use the R and X and analog buttons at the same time which is a very needed combination in Assassin's Creed.... Plz.. Fix this issue.... Due to these I am not able to play even God Of War in this app.... plz.. plz.. plz.. plz... fix this......",
        "Its a fantastic emulator and the best .. using it since 3 years..!! Gameplay is Great.. Graphics could be improved.. Sound is Glitchy (metal gear solid - peace walker).. fix it soon...!! ❤️ You PPSSPP..!!  *Cheats- I'm unable to use it.. (Make it happen soon.. probably the next update 😇) Best app on Playstore for me..!!😍😍😍 Make enhancements for HiKirin Socs.. Creators  of  PPSSPP .. please make an emulator for ps2 also (it's my wish)"

I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go."

        "I have been playing this game for a while now, and I still love it. Because even though its characters share similarities with characters in other MOBA's, they still have there own original flare that makes playing them much different then other characters from other MOBA's, and the one character that I have absolutely fallen in love with is Olivia. Because not only has she added some relevance to the jungle, she is everything I believe an assassin should be, she has a unique play style, she takes some thought and skill to use correctly, and she dominates late game with her damage output. The only problem I have now is that the older characters like beldora, skarlet, angelyne and car in have fallen far behind as actual characters.",
        "This game is perfect except for two issues. First, when I play ranked match the ping gets so high and it gets lag, but when I play other modes it's working well. Second are the controls. There are instances every game that my joystick randomly makes my hero move without my control. Please fix this and this game will be perfect.",
        "It's a pretty good moba. I don't rly write reviews.  I'm only giving 4 stars, because I just started 15 matches in ranked and i. At 100% win rate..im starting to think were playing with bots..im already ranked gold. Add opath if u wanna team up",
        "i think the game should has more items, items that have evasion, and items that gives both attack or magic and defense and heros should have mana limits. but perks should have less cooldowns with less effects but buffs should last longer this way the game will be more ingaging when there is more bottons to tap. i wrote all these to improve the game. i mean i compare this game to Dota 2. and thank you developers in general and for making  new heros all the time.",
        "1. Still laggy when the scene is crowded 2. Stop matching us with AI/bot in Matched play , Fast Game , Battle Royale , those are supposed to be vs players , that makes me suspicious maybe in ranked there are AI too because some didn't respond team chat .",
        "1- It takes so much time to match up. 2- It lags most of the time when I play ranked or matched play with my friends. Even if I play ranked alone it lags. 3- Sometimes when I try to hit enemy my controls get disabled & it doesn't work for short time then it happens again.  I will give 5 star if you solve these Issues."

        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

        "This is a really good game. I tend to be cynical about mobile games because they're usually pay to win these days but this game seems to have a very fair progression system. It's also refreshing that it's single player. That seems to be getting rare these days. My one suggestion is that there be more levels and things to do. I've only been playing for 4 days and I'm already nearing the end of the campaign. Add more missions or maybe another game mode and this game will easily earn 5 stars from me.",
        "Great time passer! This is one of the better helicopter games I have played. The sound effects are realistic along with graphics and gameplay. No regrets or bad feelings from me. This game is on both phones and my tablet. Love it!",
        "update game and increase more level and There are some Item which we will never  unlock and get up to 2-3 years and signIn problem facing even it is Not completed 30 days i lost my all progress just because of Poor Technology and Software error auto rejected progress i want back my all Progress i was completed 25 days Journey.",
        "Good game, however on my android version I keep blowing up the two transport ships and they sink but an underwater version of them keep going and I can never comple the mission? There is a bug and I'm loosing all my ammo as I keep trying all different ways of blowing the ships up but the ghost ships always make it to the end!!!",

Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."

There was no resolution to the ending. Did the Fox die, who was the man in the mask? It just seemed to cut off at the end. There should have been more to have a finality to the story. I want a refund. I pay for a lot of games and this is the first that made me regret it.",

        "Wayyyyy over priced to get 2 short chapters. Not worth the price. Maybe $0.99 would be the logical point for how short and simplistic it was. Had I known it was going to be finished in less than 20 mins of play, I would have skipped it.",
        "great game! puzzles are very difficult, it really made me think.  i just hope all of the chapters are free. such a cliffhanger on the end of chapter 1  but if u have money. go buy all of the chapters, as for me.... uninstall coz i dont have the money 😅",

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",

The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",

It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

        "Actually the game is really fantastic. The reason I gave it only 1 star is just to seek your attention because I wanted u all to add an effect of sound of engine as the car speeds up which will make the game really more realistic. I really loved playing this game but if u add that effect, it will make the game more interesting. I hope u add some more realistic effects in the game. Again I say that I gave it just 1 star to seek your attention, otherwise the game really worths a 5 star........Thank you.",

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

        "Das Quiz bricht mitten drin ab und funktioniert nicht mehr, musste App schließen und habe Fragen verpasst da bei Quizduell alle drei Fragen ja auf einen Haufen kommen, was übrigens sehr nervtötend ist und mir nicht gerade Lust darauf mach es öfter zu spielen. Und im großen und ganzen hängt die App sowieso sehr oft. Dafür das ARD soviel Geld hat, sollte man meinen sie könnten eine wenigstens mehr oder minder funktionierende App erstellen lassen. Schlechteste Game App die ich je hatte. Hoffe nach den ganzen negativen Reviews wird daran irgendwann einmal was verbessert.",
        "Live mitspielen funtioniert gar nicht",
        "Bitte mehr Notifications, wenn man dran ist, bzw ne neue Frage kommt. Beim Duell kann man vor der Finalfrage nicht zurückgehen, um sich den Spielstand anzusehen, häufig bleibt die App auch hängen....  Finde die App grundsätzlich gut, aber es gibt noch viele Kleinigkeiten und technische Probleme.",
        "Es werden keine Fragen eingeblendet, wieder gelöscht.",
        "Die App reagiert sehr zeitverzögert, was noch das geringste Problem ist. Teilweise darf ich gar nicht mitraten, weil die Frage mir nicht gestellt wird, teilweise wird die Frage nicht Mal eine Sekunde lang eingeblendet und dann war sie wieder weg. Punkte werden mir erst gegeben wenn ich die App neustarte. Die 2 Sterne gibt es für die Idee und die Sendung. Die Umsetzung ist sehr schlecht, bitte überarbeiten!   Edit: die angesprochenen Fehler habe ich jetzt nicht mehr bemerkt. Dafür trat ein anderer auf: mir wurde die Frage gar nicht gestellt und sofort rot markiert und ich konnte nachgucken was die richtige Antwort war (ohne das die tv-show schon soweit gewesen wäre). Nachdem ich die richtige Antwort wusste, wurde mir die Frage dann doch gestellt und ich konnte antworten. Punkte habe ich dann auch bekommen",
        "Die App ist im grossen und ganzen gut. Allerdings sind Fragen zum Teil einfach verschwunden, bevor man überhaupt die Antworten lesen konnte. Das ist sehr frustrierend besonders, wenn man die Arbeit weiss."

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",

        "Liked it but sometimes it just wouldn't give me the right bubbles to win at the end when I absolutely could've. If there's 4 bubbles left and none of them are yellow why do you give me a yellow one? I felt cheated",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item."

Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "The game itself is fabulous. Cute farm. Good graphics. Good work on that front. Yet being a bit more generous with westbucks in game or making some things more payable with your coins. I get that games don't create themself. But I personally am more likely to pay for games you can actually play for a bit after doing a purchase. And I don't really get that feeling here. But none the less the game itself is a work of art 😊"

        "Total ad trap! It's fine if you don't mind the same mindless levels over and over and over, skill involved is holding back to drive over things better, what story? The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse",
        "Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can't back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",
        "I like this game but i faced a problem. When i tried to make a purchase of INR 89.99 for this game,  balance has deducted but no coins or other benefits added in my account.  What is that?  When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.",
        "Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can't understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It's mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It's mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",
        "My problem with the gane comes from some sort of bug that started like an ad mid-run, then it started doing some weird rainbow pattern that flipped 90 degrees every few seconds. Now the game doesnt function when you try to start a run and the problem even persisted to my home screen before I closed the application."

But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",
        "Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "This is the best game ever I saw for farming. It haves the controls amd graphics. But still theres problem that whenever I purchase any tractor and sell it after I want another tractor then I cant purchase it. The option of purchasing becomes blur. So please make it better. If I will not see any improvement than I will less the stars rated. Regards Jagdish Gadhvi",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "This game is very nicely done. Its a genius concept except the fact that u catch zombies to make it into something is really gross. I would preffer if you could lower the pri e of the drone a bit so that there would be more play time rather than waiting play. Overall this game is superb",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested."

        "Fun and simple. Great time killer. It's a silly game with entertaining gameplay and cute characters. One thing I would change is the lack of the ability to change the sensitivity. The sensitivity is actually pretty good but I would like to be able to control it. Keep it up!",

        "The fluffies are so adorable thank you for the cute and creative graphics. Plz make more special powers for some of them, it'd be much more fun to play.  ... Plz make some merch for them, plushies, pillows etc. I'll def buy them XD"

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",

For under $2 my daughter has memory games, puzzles, fingerprinting, math, music, matching,  and the list goes on.  I spend at least $10 on a toy and for $2 it teaches and helps on long car rides and planes rides.  It's a great educational app and not a \"game\".  I would recommend especially if you're a fan of Masha and the Bear."

And then there is that glitch that happens a lot of times when you try to start a race and it uses your fuel but never starts, and that happens consistently. Please consider fixing the problems.",
        "I first got this game because it seemed interesting and whatnot, but I then completed the tutorial and went on to race other people but when I pressed the race button, I lost 20 energy but I didn't go on to race anyone or do anything else really. I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "Good overall, although I have some gripes about the stunlocking when you're ragdolled on the ground and you can't recover. Also, at the fight with Xiang Tzu in the tournament, after I win the game blurs to blue as it is supposed to, but just stay there and doesn't show my rewards. When I restart the app the game then resets me to before I fought Xiang Tzu.",
        "I have been playing this game for past few months and i just love the game. Its so addictive but today when i updated it, it has become a nuisance. Every time i defeat a opponent in a mission the game halts after \"you win\". I tried this with other missions as well but things didn't work. Please fix this bug.",
        "I want give this  game 0 star but unfortunately there is no option for that..... I had  defeated the chapter 2 last \"itu\" But whenever i defeated him this game will hang and right now i am so frustrated because coders of this game don't even know how to code this game  And i am going to uninstall this game and i will tell every friend of mine to uninstall this game and never ever install this game again. If this company left any dignity . Then this company will fix this today. If not than go hell with your self I have installed the recent update and the game itself hang. Shame on you guys You have millions of customer for this game and your doing this type of silly mistakes............",
        "Having same problems as some others after latest update game freezes after wining fight and no rewards show up so have to close the game and do it again. Seem to be stuck in the same cycle so might aswell not play til update fixes problem",
        "The update destroyed everything.. now when I win a match, the game crashes. Can't finish the missions. I tried again and again, but still crashes. It going pretty well before the update. Why was the update anyway.. to make us noobs?"

You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I'm not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won't make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.",
        "The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app",
        "WAY too many ads.  play 30 seconds, then watch a one minute ad.  Dont really know if i would like the game or not, i never got to play much of it, spent most of my time watching and trying to closeout ads.",
        "First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕",
        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver."

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout",
        "Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...",
        "It would be great if the control's could be moved. The I keep hitting the fire button when I'm not making to. A couple of glitches but otherwise a cool way to kill time. The developer is on the right track."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Not for those who want a almost free game.  Of course the developers need to make money, but I think this game goes overboard.  In order to advance in the game at a rate that keeps you interested, you must pay.  Not very balanced."

You have to aim like 30 feet above your opponent and hope that you are lobbing the knife high enough to make it there. Sometimes I would somehow win a round without even throwing a knife. Other times I'd die in the first second of play after being hit 1 time but it would take me at least 3 hits to kill my opponent. Watched a video for a free crate and then the game went back to the startup screen like it was rebooting and i had to watch another to open it. Not very much to do either. Im out.",

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "I'm surprised this game scores so well. It's an exercise in drawing/scribbling, not physics. The puzzles are very one dimensional and most of them are solved by trial and error over thought and skill. It's a novel idea but given what else is available out there I wouldn't pay a penny for this game as it lacks innovation, originality and just feels very dated.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it."

        "Not bad. Uses some pretty obscure words and doesn't give you bonus for a lot of what should be bonus words. Hard to earn coins because of this as you earn very few from solving the puzzles. Clues are expensive for the reason. TIP!  TURN OFF YOUR WIFI WHILE PLAYING AND YOU CAN AVOID THE CONSTANT ADS.",
        "Was having fun til I tried to listen to music with pandoras player while playing the game. Uninstalling bc playing the game pauses the music, and the sounds in this game are absolutely not interesting. I didn't even mind the ads since it's a free game.",
        "Two things which needs to be corrected. If the game is played in silent mode then ads should also be silent. Second, it is not possible to check the meaning of the last word because the level ends as soon as you discover the last word."

The game is like vice city that's good but in vice city their will be boats bit in this game their is no boat, air port , bus ,trucks and people are always firing hero always and fight skills have to improve. The irritation thing is mainly adds when starting or completing the missions. U should remove adds and have to update the game play",

        "One of the best games I have played on Google play. Or rather it is the best games  Cons: 1. There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5.

Which is smart I think. Gameplay is pretty fun and responsive. Upgrades don't feel unattainable. Definitely one of the better games on the play store",
        "There is a sudden difficulty spike in this game around level 20. Even if u have the best ship and weapons ur no match for the hordes of enemies. This is not right. Even after spending money the developers dont want you to win in my opinion. Dont know whats the logic.",
        "It's almost nothing without buying coins, u cant even win normal difficulty without ads and purchasing coins, how r we supposed to upgrade our weapons when every map gives u only around 200 and u need 20000 after a while for only one upgrade????!!!!!! Its graphic and gameplay is really good but like I said no progress in winning after a few maps",
        "It's simply too difficult to see when your finger is in the way.   Is there a fix? No.  Fun game. Too hard for my taste.  My $0.02",
        "Stuck on level 32. Theres no way past this level without spending some bucks (crazy prices). Hate the fact that there is no other way, but to  pay for the best upgrades.",
        "Well I can't be mental, I am physically disabled, only this body is disabled, but we can think, ask somebody mental to play pass level 21 plus, we  did pass 21 plus LEVELS.  No disrespect to anybody mental/physically disabled."

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",

        "If you are looking for a fun game, this is not one of 'em. It is so annoying. It gets me is mad that I've DELETED it twice. But... when you win the levels you feel like you have just met Jesus. Also, the first few levels are easy.",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars"

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I still love this game! However I have yet to change my mind about the fact that it takes longer to vote just for 3 stars at a time, than to actually design the max of 5 designs per day. Can you not increase stars won per vote? Can you not make designs brief even more compulsory as many designers dont follow the brief and you just end up losing votes because your design is too colourful or eclectic",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget."

        "I think this game has potential. The gameplay is fun and so far I enjoyed the pvp battle. I gave a 4 star because the game lacks variety in the early levels - I don't feel myself making any progress after playing for two hours. Also,  the game is pushing too hard to sell their ingame currency and bundles, reminds me of those cheaply made games with a sole purpose to scam your money.  Please create a better sales strategy because this game has more potential than that",
        "BAD CONNECTION ISSUES WITH LATEST PATCH. Pretty fun, but it's never able to find a game while on 4G. I have to connect to wifi (slower!) for matchmaking to work.",
        "Pretty good. I am able to go pretty far without purchasing anything but I am sure money makes it easier.   Only complaint is there are no PVE missions. That would totally make this a 5 star game.",
        "I might've given 4/5 stars for this game but i rate it lower due to game lack of honesty. 90 or 80 percent chance of success means 90 or 80 percent of failure. im fed up being failed upgrade despite 90 percent chance of success failed several times on highest tier ship which req lits of golds. ssounds like a rigged slot machine but too obvious",
        "Three different options for the controls, including a \"pro\" option, but  no option for inverted y-axis. Clearly the developer has no idea what pro actually means.  Uninstalled as soon as I saw that.",
        "I am so addicted to it! I can't stop playing. It is a really good game, yet I'd like to see some added things. One thing I'd like to see is side guns that only shoot to the side and things like that. I think it'd make combat more interesting. I'd also love to see ramming damage added or even as a weapon or a specific ship. Other than that, I love it."

        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",

        "The app is always not responding.  And this makes my children felt irritated. They loves peppa as their favorite animated character so that they very much happy knowing that I installed this app. A little favor...please fix it so my children continually enjoy while learning.",
        "Great little finger friendly app for very little kids BUT..the second you turn the phone or make any movement it crashes and it has to be totally reloaded. Would also be nice if you could erase pics in one swipe without eraser which takes forever on a whole picture.",
        "App looks ok and plays ok, only issue I had was that it crashed my Samsung S7 and shut it off. Only fix was to directly delete install folders from my phones directory.  Other than that, it was ok for my little one.",
        "This game is so awesome. Everytime my sister clocks im on my phone she starts screaming then suddenly she stops. Why? Because i just gave her the phone and she's playing this game. Love it so much plz make another game like that ive got another sister whos 1 and is gonna start screaming too soon😁😁",
        "Amazingly Awesome!!! Dear Entertaining One,Your Game is Really Nice.But,if you can,please add more characters in the next update like Mommy Pig,Daddy Pig,Grandma Pig and Grandpa Pig because I want to see what they do,like Peppa and George.Both siblings oink or laugh,and that's why I want to add more characters.Even though I'm 10,this game is awesome! Again,thank for this game and God Bless You All. Love,Daylight Sunshine"

        "Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It's a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "As much as I want to love this game, its also quite cheap. Every single race, the same \"real\" players are always there regardless of time of day. They follow the same route and incredibly make no mistakes at all! Meanwhile, I'm getting stuck on every edge, my wheel gets stuck in the ground and every single gate smashes only me. Amazing!! Its a super fun game but don't think for a second that it plays fair.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "Thankyou gor being creative i wish you add more challenge : crash crush. That is like just crush using vlad and rufus (example) and then crush make them crush so who is the winner. Using that game we can know who is the stronger"

        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season",
        "Kinda hate the drift feature, like the car just auto drifts in the direction u turn. This gets annoying too since u can't turn normally when needed and the car just starts drifting, making u hit more obstacles. Graphics are good, my phone can handle the very high settings so I haven't played on the lower settings.",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

It's so awesome and I absolutely love how everything is pixelated and that makes it more charming. Not to mention that the music is fantastic as well and I never get tired of listening to it!",
        "This would be a fine time-waster if they reign in the ads, until that happens, about like the plague.  They started out as a means to (optional) easy buffs. Fine, annoying, but not that bad. Suddenly, random ads are popping up in the middle of the game and you get nothing out of it. Totally unacceptable way to run a game. Don't bother, there are thousands of other time wasting idle/incremental games that show an ounce of respect for their customers. These guys simply don't.",
        "Love this game because you don't have to spend real money, just tap the screen to get coins and also diamonds then upgrade the guns, rinse and repeat but it never gets boring. Only trouble I've had is a sore tapping finger. LOL",
        "this game is basically an app for watching ads. you are forced to watch ads in order to progress. on the top of that, when you upgrade your stuff, the game randomly starts an ad. to have double money, you have to watch an ad. to collect diamonds.. guess what, watch an ad. to start idle mode? yes, watch an ad. utterly disgusting, terrible design.",
        "A great fully free game. It is a bit ad heavy but absolutely no microtransactions so I'm fine with supporting them that way. Very fun game definitely worth a play",
        "Holy ads! Intrusive ads every few clicks. EVERYTHING is ad-based. Good gameplay, but obviously an app created to generate ad revenue."

And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Awesome It's a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)",
        "Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!"

It isn't rigged to fail like so many games today!  UPDATE:  I've just reached level 1,600 and still enjoy the game every much as I did from level 1!  I honestly can't say that about any other game.  This is a great game for just passing the time, or challenge yourself to get 3 stars by studying all possible ways to complete the task.  YOU choose how much effort to put into it.",

        "I want to love this game.  It's pretty. The characters are adorable.  The concept is creative. However, the controls are challenging at best. Also, gathering enough sunshine to do anything is mind-numbingly slow.  Thank you devs for neat but unplayable game.",
        "The storyline is a great idea, but unfortunately the execution iof this game is rubbish. Despite the lengthy and slow \"click the cloud\" interactions with in-game characters, instructions are so minimal that you get very bored with working out what you are supposed to do.  Graphics aren't really impressive, and although it is perfectly easy to understand how to move your character around the screen, doing so in these ways is a pain. I really wanted to like this game, but frankly it feels a bit like playing something a couple of decades older.",

However one problem is the game not unlocking vehicles, maps, and helmets. The biggest example of this is the turbo turtles mission. I am somehow not able to unlock the turtle and skeleton knight even after completing it in various different ways. Even so, this game is an absolute must have for people who want to have a mix of competitiveness and fun!",

Sometimes it will double move when you've only pressed to move once and you can only undo one time so you're basically screwed. I got up to over 447 thousand and it did this and ruined it all. Then it plays loud ads.",

        "The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been \"hacked\" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)",
        "I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It's not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you've got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable."

        "I don't like you can't make the buildings the color you want to because you have to change them to level up. Leveling up takes forever if your not willing to spend a lot of actual money. My horses stay needing the infirmary so they are always busy which means they are not available to complete guest wishes, or for breeding, or training. It cost a ton to add spots in the buildings for supplies or to be able to have more than one horse in a building at once. Wish it didn't cost so much I would have really liked the game. Will be deleting this app",
        "The game starts off being a great game but then becomes a huge cash grab once they think the have you hooked.  Too bad cause this has the potential to be a top contending game if they would just ease up on the cost of some items.",
        "I like the game except the fact that things are very expensive and you don't get a lot of money from customers. Plus I have to level up a horse to fulfill a board request but then can't put that horse in any of my buildings because they are a lower level...this is an issue with guests too. I go to upgrade to the next level (4) but when I click the color I need it doesn't give me the amount of fix up points it claims (ex: +75 for lavender but it only foes up +5 on the meter). And half my guests want items I can't give them because I am nowhere near the amount of money required to purchase the building.  I think upsets needs to reformat the pricing of items within the game or up the amount given by guests. Because eventually I may find myself at a point I can no longer continue as I will not spend actual money.",
        "Really love this game. However it could be so much better. The ruby system is awful and the cash you get from guests is not enough.",
        "I loved it, until I got an error 3 message and can't even play now it says to reload the game, lost all. Shame too because I enjoyed it.",
        "I really like this game it is so much fun to play.  thank you Guy's so very much.I am a very happy person because you guy's mad this horse farm game again thank you guy's I am having so much fun with this game.i love this game it keeps me so so so very busy again thank you guy's.can you nice people please make some great games like this one.thank you Guy's for making this game.thank you guy's I like it .this is a very very very fun game to play."

I just had this idea for no update that on holidays sometimes the creators could discount how much you need to buy hearts and bannas creators, you dont have to do it. It's just an idea but none the less its a cool game.",

On tablet i am loged in with a google paly account, when i login to same account on my phone it doesnt ask me to download other chapters and i dont have any items or achivements. Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",
        "Not the master. But I had got with the achievement \"thaught the teacher\". After defeating hermit now I am used to magic. Only in few minutes I can earn money and upgrade\u200b my gear. Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "I have been playing this game for over 3years now and I know how far I have gone with the game... Just lost my phone and I got a new one and... Google Play can't restore Me to my previous level.. Please fix because I can't just start playing the game over from the beginning.. Thanks"

Top it off with some multiplayer of some kind and this would be my no1 game, I don't even mind that it takes a while to earn money.",

And for that it give me bonus , I actually     delete it. Many people loves fast driving but this game motivate you drive fast & crazily like you don't care to have an accident with a truck in opposite side!",

        "All of this is absolutely amazing. I have social anxiety, and the first time I played this (which was minutes ago) helped me so much. I could simply get lost in my own little world- or should I say oasis- for a while so I can calm down. Also the little messages are very sweet, and I love the artstyle! All in all this is a fantastic game, I wholeheartedly love it. C:",
        "I like it a lot but I only wish I could turn off the SFX for tapping and leave the BGM and ambient noises (like rain from the weather and rain cloud) on. Other than that, the ads are subtle and unobtrusive, the bonuses reasonably helpful for the cost, and the shop is nice (but unnecessary! You can enjoy the game without it. )",
        "Ads, ads and more ads. Rated family friendly but ads include electric cigarettes and lottery. Not exactly family friendly. The game is based on tapping to gain hearts to buy things to gain more hearts. Neat except it's nearly impossible to avoid the ads, which seem to be nothing but electric cigarettes and lottery ads (more than 6/10). Even when you're trying to play without ads, you will inevitably tap one of those inspirational messages from one of the animals or plants and launch an ad.",
        "I really love the inspirational phrases that pop up randomly. It really changes my mood when I read one. The only thing is that I wish this could have a journal section. Where I could write thoughts down or a gratitude journal where you write 3 good things that happen today and you could double your hearts. It would help level up the land faster and for people that are using this as a pick me up app. It would help us put our thoughts down all in the same place. :)",
        "I've only been playing this game for about 30 minutes and I can already say this game is one I'll be playing for a long while. I have a job interview coming up and boy does this relieve my anxiety! The little bubbles of encouragement is a very nice touch! They make me feel warm and fuzzy.",
        "The Ad. we're too long to enjoy the game! Sometimes it shows that I should rotate the screen to display Ad. but I have rotated the screen and cannot resolve the situation. All I can do was press the home button ànd kill the process fróm recent APP list then relaunch the APP."

And addictive including this one it's fun and ever since the first play I've been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don't change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.",
        "Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don't have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!",
        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.",
        "THIS GAME IS RIGGED FOR YOU TO WIN. All you have to do is not die. I literally just played a game without rolling over any boosts and still won. The bots are programmed to let you win and just die before the end. This makes the game too easy and not fun to play."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Not for those who want a almost free game.  Of course the developers need to make money, but I think this game goes overboard.  In order to advance in the game at a rate that keeps you interested, you must pay.  Not very balanced."

I fully upgraded my first starter and reserve and now i have like 50000 in money and can't buy anything since it all requires gold not cash. If it was cash not gold i would give it 5 stars in an instant",
        "I am amending my original 5 star review. I am now giving this game 1 star due to the feature that claims to allow you to earn more gold. I tried a couple of different offers which involved \"a quick survey and email address\". This was complete BS. They were both endless loops of surveys and information mines, and never was given my promised reward after completing the initial survey. This is very dishonest and extremely annoying. So annoying that it prompted me to take the time to change my 5 star review to 1 star.",

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Please give us the option to disable Auto Target Tracking in settings.  The auto tracking can cause you to fire at ships your not wanting to target, especially if there lined up side by side. And cause your shots to fall way short or too far if the enemy ship is coming straight towards you. If love to have the ability to disable this feature in the settings."

However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "Good overall, although I have some gripes about the stunlocking when you're ragdolled on the ground and you can't recover. Also, at the fight with Xiang Tzu in the tournament, after I win the game blurs to blue as it is supposed to, but just stay there and doesn't show my rewards. When I restart the app the game then resets me to before I fought Xiang Tzu.",
        "I have been playing this game for past few months and i just love the game. Its so addictive but today when i updated it, it has become a nuisance. Every time i defeat a opponent in a mission the game halts after \"you win\". I tried this with other missions as well but things didn't work. Please fix this bug.",
        "Having same problems as some others after latest update game freezes after wining fight and no rewards show up so have to close the game and do it again. Seem to be stuck in the same cycle so might aswell not play til update fixes problem",
        "The update destroyed everything.. now when I win a match, the game crashes. Can't finish the missions. I tried again and again, but still crashes. It going pretty well before the update. Why was the update anyway.. to make us noobs?",
        "It is impossible to level up with sidemissions which come once in seven hours and the game is tough as hell. My xp bar was three fourth full and suddenly it became one fourth game matching is also insanely inaccurate. Results not loading game is crashing"

        "Purchased the full unlock for $7.99 and every time my daughter gets to the pinkie pie level at the crystal empire it freezes up at the same spot and she can't finish the game I want my money back.  Additionally, the purchase is supposed to remove ads yet once you exit a level an ad pops up again.",

Then closing this reloads the my little pony game from the beginning so you lose all progress anyway. Totally unplayable and not acceptable to give to children, Budge should be asahmed of themselves!

        "Gameplay was very good, if not ridiculous in rewarding you for cheaply built yet unstable structures....but whatever, that's a game mechanic that can be overlooked. What really turns me off to this game though are the push notifications. For one, why does a game like this even NEED push notifications. Secondly, to then make me unable to disable said feature is ridiculous. So 1 star out of sheer prinicple",
        "I remember playing an older version of this game called \"Bridge Constructor\" & I'm afraid this new version makes me feel nostalgic for the old one. The scoring system is purely financial (it used to consider how stable the bridge was as well). The game seems to want to get you to build the bridge how it wants you to build it. Creativity is discouraged.",
        "This really gets your brain working to solve these challenges. It could only get better with a sand box mode, but having the constraints of each scenario keeps you on your toes.",
        "Actually forces the player to engage some brain cells and memory banks. The practicle application of physics is a must with this game and you are essentially in awe of good ole Roman engineering.   As an educational application, this presents an excellent opportunity for individuals to learn the basics of civil engineering.  I sincerely applaud the developers.",

You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and – most of all – adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car. Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won't be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.You will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don't want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!In addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.The game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you've built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.Realistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don't let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!Game features:- Superb physics - a true simulator - Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds- State of the art realistic graphics- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won't get bored as you build - Spectacular special effects- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic - Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor - Built-in hint system helps you build your skill",

        "Fun game until you get to a level where you have to pay to move on. Minimum diamonds needed to delete tough lines is 200 And you can only earn diamonds 5 or 10 at a time. Need to be able to earn diamonds faster.  Even if you purchase diamonds the pricing is exorbitant.  Way out of line with other games. Update: don't waste your money to update to a better ball. It does no good and actually makes the game harder.",
        "I wish I could say this was a great game, I love brick games like this one but unfortunately this one is still buggy. For some reason everytime I try and Shoot To the Left it releases before I take my thumb off and completely screws up my shot. Does not seem to happen as much when shooting to the right side of the screen. Especially annoying when I have one block left in the warning Zone. The aiming is also an issue. Fix these issues and I will absolutely love this game.",
        "Simple. Fun. No intrusive, annoying ads that force you out of the gameplay, jyst a simple bar at tge top I was actually inckibed to look at because I FELT like giving sonething back because I was enjiying the game. All games shoikd be like this. Try firce ads diwn our thrists, we will uninstall and play sonething else. Which is how I found this gem. Well done people, excellent spin on block breaker."

Everyday when I come home from school, I play it but the thing about it is that I don't like when you buy a power-up and then you only have an hour and fifty-nine minutes to use it.To me it is very unfair for me and other players to have that limited amount of time.When I first downloaded it, I thought that when you buy a power-up, you would have it permanently. So please fix that problem. Thank You. Fix the problem right now!!!!!! Fix It!!!!!! I hope you Game Shakers heard me So all you have to do is raise that time limit or just make us have them permanently. One or the other. So just choose One!!!!!! OK? Good I hope you heard me. Good.

All the \"good reviews\" are from cringey 9 year olds or their parents. Nick has never been good with game. ESPECIALLY in this dark age. Parents go get your kids shooty skies. Not this hunk of garbage. Also (my opinion)  Cartoon network is much better than Nick.",

        "I love Snoopy! This is a great game. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star is because it runs slowly on my tablet. I do not have that many apps on my tablet that can inhibit the game's performance so not sure what the issue could be. Overall I do like this game!",

        "I only tried it because I've always loved the Peanuts gang ! Although the games are maxed out with either match 3 or bubble popping, this one has proved that they aren't all alike ! Its cute and challenging. I've really enjoyed it so far !"

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",

Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."

        "Total ad trap! It's fine if you don't mind the same mindless levels over and over and over, skill involved is holding back to drive over things better, what story? The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse",
        "Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can't back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",
        "I like this game but i faced a problem. When i tried to make a purchase of INR 89.99 for this game,  balance has deducted but no coins or other benefits added in my account.  What is that?  When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.",
        "Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can't understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It's mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It's mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",
        "My problem with the gane comes from some sort of bug that started like an ad mid-run, then it started doing some weird rainbow pattern that flipped 90 degrees every few seconds. Now the game doesnt function when you try to start a run and the problem even persisted to my home screen before I closed the application."

Sometimes you can rejoin and continue where you left off, other times or says the room is full. 5 stars if they get this issue fixed and quit blaming the ISP when it's their equipment.",
        "I really love this game, not sure why. The only problem is that I keep on getting disconnected from servers or I'm not able to load into battle royale or the qualifying games. I get disconnected from the wifi for a few seconds, I thought it was just the phone but when I uninstalled the game it stopped. It happens almost every other game, sometimes a few (5+) games in a row. For most games I would just uninstall after a while and find something else, but I really enjoy playing. Hopefully that gets fixed, I saw a lot of other reviews saying the same thing. ~Lagging",
        "The game is actually really fun, when it works... But it's so temperamental...  Games  disconnect regularly.  My other big issue is that there isn't a global leaderboard, Google play integration, achievements, or an easy way to start a game with friends.  On a side note the English translations are pretty poor, but it doesn't take away from the fub.!",
        "Crashes way too much. Fun, then crashes.  Glitches everywhere.  Multiple functions of game play do not work, like \"Firestorm Arena\". (It spawns me alone, always without opponents.)  Awful app construction, fun concept.  *(This review is not... \"for an older version\". It is for the current glitchy as hell dysfunctional version. It has been dysfunctional for months and will be for months after this post. This is a current review for the current version of the game.)*",
        "The game is really good. I'm really enjoying it but after playing for about 15 to 20 minutes it just quits, like it's crashing. This usually happens when I'm first place and level 17 or so. Really frustrating as it means I've gotta start again. Will happily increase to 5 stars once this has been resolved. Great game other than that!",
        "I personally love this game. The controls are fluent, and it is all around a good game. 😀 But, for some reason, whenever I go into the battle Royal game, it just instantly kills me! Sometimes it works, but most of the time it just kills me straight away. Maybe it's me... Idk other than that, great game!"

It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "The fast pace of the game keeps you hooked.  They don't throw ads at you but certainly make them available for great benefits.  It's not clunky at all which makes it easy to pick up and play a couple minutes here and there.  It's a ridiculous concept of making money off taxis/fares, heck I'd move to the cab driver profession if I made &gt;$500 million on one fare... but funny and fun nonetheless.",
        "I really like this game a lot. I'm not usually into these idle games, but from all the ones ive tried. Ive enjoyed this one the most. Other then the occasional slow down, it mostly runs great. And the model for ads is very very fair. If you decide to watch and ad, you always get some kind of reward out of it. But its completely optional.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Huge battery drain compared to any other game i have played including the new tekken and sims mobile games which are much more graphical. Will sometimes lose game progress when you completely close the app (so not running in background). Taxi's occasionally get stuck on buildings or vanish off screen completely. If it wasn't for these issues it could be a much better game.",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like."

        "I find it a little tricky to navigate sometimes, since it makes my on-screen navigation bar disappear. I like it but maybe I would like it more if there was a back arrow? Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",
        "Really disappointed. I played the party game to win the St Patrick's badge. I came 2nd place when it finished and ift said I had won a badge but it doesn't appear in my badge collection. Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. 😟",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",
        "I haven't been able to change my profile picture since December. I keep getting an error. I thought the most recent update would fix it, but still am not able.",
        "My wife and I both bought power ups yesterday March 17. Big sale right?  I had 20 something already and only ended up with 133 after buying 180. My wife bought \"180\"  twice thinking she may have made a mistake the first time and only ended up with about 300 total. She already had quite a few to begin with. Ripoff!"

        "This game is great! Though there are things I would change about the new race mode and some things in arcade mode. For example, instead of having to pay a dollar USD to cut the rope tire, why not pay a thousand coins to get rid of it for the next 5 or 10 times it needs to show up, and have us pay the dollar to get rid of it for good. And in arcade, if you accidentally missed your reward,why not have it double the next reward rather then keep the amount the same all the time, otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing besides those two things, I love it ^^",
        "The climbing game is the only thing I hate, it's such BS. My knife will slide and hit a branch after it went into the wood. That's not supposed to happen. But overall great game.",
        "Not perfect but it's really good, hate the tires though, not willing to pay any amount of money to remove them. It would be better if after 1-5 thousand score on race, the tire would be removed or maybe throw a knife 10 times through the tire and it would be gone. Kinda silly to pay to  remove something that would make for much better gameplay if the player could play the game and earn it gone. (Mostly doing this for the 500 coins but this is an honest review)",
        "Great visuals, smooth physics, and addicting Gameplay. Great game, my only thing I'd change would be the end-game knives, past 10k all the knives kinda suck, and have awful 'flipability', making it pointless to save up for anything above 10-15k. If you added a better variety of knives into the game this would be a 5 star.",
        "Please devs, read that. You are losing the point here. The game should be good and exciting so we can support you, and not irritating and frustrating. The knives always hit with the sharp part and it is not always that it hang on the wood. It seems it is a matter of luck/random result of some algorithm. Now if that matter of luck wasn't enough, we need to dodge an annoying tire, or just pay to have it removed. Instead of pay because we like the game we should pay to play? Put a price in the game and all knives available to buy with the game money and I buy it. Let it as it is now and you won't ever see any cent from me, not even from ads because I only play it offline. I refuse to watch any ad even if I could increase a reward in 10x.",

        "03-23-18: HOLY SHEET THE SCI-FI UPDATE IS CRAZY AMAZING! Outerminds has done it again! I wish they made more unique celebrations (like SciFi) other than Christmas or Valentine's in the future, such as Easter or even a Video Game Mashup update. It is time to rewrite my review!  So far, it's my favorite time-waster in my device. Never utilizes the Pay2Win paywalls for the most of the time (It's one of the best non-Pay2Win apps in the era of Pay2Win), and never crashes at all! Bugs aren't frequent! There are easy ways to save Bux and Brains in the game, which gives almost every player the opportunity to customize without any problem.  The game is hugely customizable. It's like being a home designer and a Tuber at the same time. There's lots of different customization options for your room, Tuber, and stuff. I also love to switch to a certain theme during events like SciFi or Valentine's Event.  And next, the videos. You can name your videos whatever you want, and you can select a combination of genres. You could make hilarious titles like \"PewDiePie Plays His Game\" or \"Edgar The Rapper\". And then you can pretend to act them out.  One of the best parts of the game is that there are almost no annoying popup video/banner ads, unlike in most games I've played like Vlogger Go Viral. The only way to view them is to simply go for a free shipping boost by watching an ad (which does not interrupt gameplay. Watching ads is also in Quests too, and it's fine as well.)  I like the Puggle minigame as well. It doesn't make the game feel boring as it can help boost shipping time while being a playable Pachinko with Edgar and Maya.  The game's community is also very cool. No cancerous fights or something, many players of this Tuber Simulator mostly focus on hatching Pixelings, participate in room contests, and get tips on how to grind Bux! Check out the Google+ semiofficial community as well.  Probably the greatest Tuber game on the web, Outerminds. I'll send you a Sponsor Eagle filled with \"Good Job\" messages. Keep your game as good as possible, there's no time to lose in beating PewDiePie to his #1 spot!",

On tablet i am loged in with a google paly account, when i login to same account on my phone it doesnt ask me to download other chapters and i dont have any items or achivements. Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",
        "Not the master. But I had got with the achievement \"thaught the teacher\". After defeating hermit now I am used to magic. Only in few minutes I can earn money and upgrade\u200b my gear. Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "I have been playing this game for over 3years now and I know how far I have gone with the game... Just lost my phone and I got a new one and... Google Play can't restore Me to my previous level.. Please fix because I can't just start playing the game over from the beginning.. Thanks"

I would assume that they have been \"hacked\" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)",

When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It's not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you've got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable."

        "Too many bots and the game keeps asking me to give it more access to my phone than it really needs to run.   Other than that it is fun.  If they fixed these issues it would be 5 stars."

PLEASE.",
        "LOVE this game and have done for such a long time as I'm a huge KK fan. My only issue is, that it's pay to play for sure.  It's hard to make money and gain k stars. Everything is OVER PRICED. Even to just furnish your home. I hope kim and Glu reconsider this as not everyone has money to splash on what you need to progress more quickly.",
        "I've spent probably thousands on this game because I liked it, but I'm having serious problems. Back on March 13Th I bought yet another hundred dollar kstar pack that did not go through. I was able to confirm the order and they \"added it to my account\". The problem is I still haven't gotten it. And I've sent screenshots showing I have not gotten it. I've purchased several other packs of various prices and I've received them all, but I've still, to this day, not received the hundred dollar one. I keep getting bounced around and told \"just do a hard reset\" which I've already done several times as well as turning off my phone and everything. That doesn't explain why I've gotten the other purchases but not this one. On top of that, the \"help\" I've been getting has been taking longer and longer to even respond, each time though I'm getting the same unhelpful answers.  If it was five dollars I would have just forgotten it, but I'm being screwed out of 100 dollars with no answers. I'm extremely disappointed.  Buyers beware.",
        "Pretty cool game. I did buy the small star pack and it never showed up. Kinda lame. If someone could look into it that'd be great. I would just like to receive the stars. Not a refund. Please and thank you",
        "If you own a yacht, be able to travel around the globe on it like your plane. When purchasing houses and furniture allow options on colors and styles. Be able to choose from different outfits for runway and photoshoots, not from your own personal closet.  If they can model under water then make them dance, sit,  hug, kiss and sleep. They should be more life like. Add more games to play at the Miraggio casino.  Add more cash outfits not as many kstar outfits.",
        "So...I'm thinking Kim kardashian again puts her name on something that would flop...but this is surprisingly a great game. I'm addicted to trying to level up etc. Worth a download.   Update- game won't start.  I'm losing progress in the game. Hope this gets fixed soon"
