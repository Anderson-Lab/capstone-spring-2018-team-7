        "TOO MANY ADS. Saw an ad that said only 1% get past level nine. So I tried it. It would play a 30 second ad every 2 attempts. Each attempt only takes about 15 seconds so about 50% of your time is spent watching ads. Beat level 15 in less than 20 minutes so clearly they were false advertising or they included the people that uninstalled the game cuz of it's ads spam and pathetic gameplay.",
        "never in my life have i seen so many adds on a game. don't waste your life or your data. you cannot skip the adds and they are at least 30 seconds long.... absolute rubbish waste of time",
        "It's a fun game killed by excessive amount of ads. Like 30 seconds every two or so levels and every time you lose it's way too much. They'd be a five star game without that ridiculous amount of ads.",
        "Fun but WAY too many Ads. 30s + after every other game. Changed to another game also called scale but not containing ads.  If they would reduce the number of ads it would be a great game",
        "Way too many ads. Don't quite understand why anyone would think that's the right balance coz I'm like.. I'm not playing this anymore just coz of the ridiculous amount of ads.",
        "Superb! Way too many adverts - but worth the small price to go advert free. If, like me, you loved Qix back in the day you'll love this!"

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

Extra blades that just appear and sit in a corner of the screen.  Ads wont count down, and entire app needs to be restarted to get back to home page. Also have the app freeze just after I enter games and lose all the starfruit/gold apples it cost to play, but never even got to open that game. Super pissed and dissapointed.",

I will level up, get my Sword and dojo of Choice then two weeks later for no  it is gone.  I have Stopped playing because I am tired of Starting over on a saved linked account ever couple of weeks.",
        "I'm a great fan of ur game but I don't know why I'm not getting any dojos or blades from daily challenge. I got 1 dojo and 3 blades from daily challenge after that I played 15 days continueosly but I got only 5000 star fruit but no blades or dojos. Please solve this problem I really want to give 5 stars for this awesome game. 😞😞😢😢😩😩",
        "It's a good game.but unfortunately I launched the app once and when I left I couldn't get back.it just crashes over and over again...also when I tried to login to Google play it was an error,even though my internet is fine.thats why I don't want to reinstall it,because I'll loose all my progress:(",
        "Of course I love the game, but I can't get my free star fruit because the videos aren't playing. I can't redeem my free golden apples because of the videos not playing. I've lost out on more than 300 star fruit and 100 golden apples. Please fix this.",
        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime."

        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",

        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall.",

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!!

I wish you'd left in the settings so if we wanted the moving graphics we could have them. And, if not, the they'd be totally still and not distracting.  Make everyone happy that way. :,( Will be uninstalling this now.",
        "This game is stupid. It froze my phone n i  had to buy a new one for 4589 dollars. Dont waste ur time downloading this. If u give good comments n ur planning to play this game for the rest of ur life...... Well, in 2 days u will need a new phone n u will end up buying a new one. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME I REPEAT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME.",

        "I believe that we need a game that is simple, has no limit  of time to play, and you don't have to compare your score with others.  You just need to beat your own best score if you want. It's killing time in a portion that you chose.",
        "Simple (which I like) puzzle game, yet gets really challenging in strategy thinking as it progresses, which is good if you want a challenge and aren't already mentally tired from work, etc. Easy on the eyes and has really pleasant nature theme on the edges with a bird song loop. Hardly noticed any ads, which was also really nice. One of the BEST free games to take your mind off things!"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

        "I will consider rating the game five stars if you can add new levels and lines, but the \"hearts\" feature forces me to watch ads, even though I paid to remove ads. I will give the game five stars if you gracefully remove the \"hearts\" feature. I'm asking CM a question: \"Will you please change the game back to the original way we played it? And add new levels? 'The Easter' would be creative, and the diamonds can be eggs. How about an Easter Bunny line? I like all the new levels, and the new lines we can unlock. Can you add more remixes to the levels? There are only 3 existing remixes, if CM had forgotten.\"",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "The game starts off really strongly and the concept is unique and the music is fabulous.. but later on things get so progressively difficult it makes flappy bird look like a piece of cake... And in the later on levels there's not much sync between the music and the cube it's really hard to play... I enjoyed it initially but now I'm just going to uninstall it...",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads."

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I love this game. When my sister downloaded it on her iPad i was sooo addicted to it and now i am downloading it on my own phone!!!! I really recommend to try it at least for once. If you will do so you will not be able to delete it easily beacuse you will be addicted!!!!!",
        "Remove the villagers plz i hate that they keep coming into the house i build and dont leave i have built 10 houses for me and they just keep coming in and its really inoying"

        "Like so many other games like this out there it is\"pay to win\". This is nearly every \"free\" mobile game it there now. So why the 5 stars? A few reasons. A big one being that they do make the super currency accessible without paying via offers. Many of which rewards higher amount than what someone would come to expect just for making it a fair ways into other games.  Second is that the levelling system is fair and no content is truly locked for those who don't pay. It will just take you a little longer to get what you want if you don't but it won't be excluding you from the best content.   As for the game itself is alright. You collect heroes and you can engage in a variety of activities. From a campaign mode and it's associated elite version to random dungeons to guild wars, pvp, and a gauntlet. Overall you can kill however much time you want on this game. Once you start attaining higher levels you will find it easier to spend more and more time on content.  Finally as always I strongly recommend doing a Google search too learn best strategies.",

        "Really enjoy the game. Only problem is,it will not let me in the Dungeon. Can you fix this for me? 5 stars without that problem.",

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

        "This is the best of its kind for mobile, and one of the best overall. The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST. FU!CKING FIX THIS LOGIN ISSUE!!!!",
        "Well they still have to grow but I think it's op. As I play a lot of CS:Go (not sponsoring)  then I thought this could help me because my PC stopped working.. Anyways graphics aren't great but good.. They aren't clean. Oh and last before I end this comment- when you complete offer for credits it doesn't give you the credits.. That's sad..  So yeah.. Just keep it up!! 👍👍"

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

Or be able to type first and last name.",

I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",

        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine..",
        "This game is all pay to play. You can't compete without dumping a bunch of money into it. So like an idiot I put some money into the game and sure enough. It matched me with guys 10 times stronger then me. There's no winning unless you plan to put a lot of money into it. Which I will not be doing. Uninstalling"

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is actually good. The biggest downside is that there's A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT to watch during playing. I know this is a free game, but c'mon! Waiting and watching minutes of the advertisement is longer than playing the game itself. Not to mention the conversation between characters in the game also took too long to wait and there's some things need to use real money before it can be explored.  This kind of game supposed to be fun and gives the cha cha feeling, but instead I get frustrated of waiting for the advertisement to finish before I can continue playing.  Out of all that, this game is great."

        "lnstaII \"VEARN\" App to Start Earningz Ref- (FERA) I never knew that I can earn money just by WATCHING Advertisements! VEARN App is Iegit one which allows earning points just by doing simple tasks like watch advertises,videos and so on. Then you can exchange your points for PYAPAL/PATYM/Gift Cards and there're various options to choose from. Also \"VADZ\" App is perfect for anyone in anywhere who has free time and doesn't wana waste it, you can use it while working,travelling.. simply earning by watching advertisements,videos..",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "1 l. no more free heroes added,always add paid heroes. 2. no more free castle skin,need topup to upgrade castle skin 3. all latest event just for them who buy something in the shop , no free spin like 1 years ago",
        "The game is good but very expensive.  There is not much scope for a free to play players.  Paid players will keep burning you all the time unless you spend money to be able to survive.   However,  the most annoying thing is that the game has become too crowded. IGG needs to make new servers and there should be limit for the maximum number of players in any particular server.  It is really difficult to survive even for paid players with so many castles everywhere in the map.  You don't get enough tiles to farm and nowhere to hide.  I give a 5 star rating if IGG works toward this problem. Thanks.",
        "I Don't normally play war games or any pvp games, but this has so much more than just pvp and war, or those build it and wait games! There's basically games within your castle that you can play while you're waiting  to build stuff and so much more!"

        "Great little game except i downloaded it to play in a quiet place but after turning off music and sound it over ride the settings. I also put my phone mute on and it still played music on ads and when pressing the arrow button in the game. Not impressed",
        "The ads in this game made it unplayable. I used to love this game and I downloaded it to try playing again and I would get minute and a half ads after every third attempt at a level. It felt like nearly every time I failed a level it would ask me if the level was too hard and I needed a hint. This game is incredibly obnoxious to play with ads on",
        "Well i would give this five stars but you cant watch an add to get a power up! And you should lower the ad mount of adds i cant go in for 10 seconds without an add popping up!! Overall good great game",
        "Way too many ads after every time I lose or go onto another level an advert pops up. Verry annoying. But the gameplay is decent.",
        "Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.",
        "I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!"

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

Other than that its all good and gives plenty of chances to keep trying for your current objectives. Which is by all means what anyone would love to have with this kind of hit and miss game.",

        "I like the game but it's way too hard to get rings and you can't ever get the carachter in the daily spin wheel, make it so there are a lot more red rings to collect and I WILL rate five 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟s",

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "I don't know if the rumors about  talking Angela and talking Tom are just apps that people use to kidnap children but just to make sure don't turn on ur camera I disbelieve this rumor but who know? Anyway this was a amazing game 5 stars for me I lovebirds so much and it's so addictive she is so adorable",
        "I love the game. But since the recent update I did 2 days ago it crashes out. Every time I try to play the games. Im on the matching game for so long and then it exits itself and when I open it from recent activity it starts over, Angela tired but no credit for the coins I earned. SO UNFAIR.",
        "Okay, I used to love this game. But, ever since the update. The game has been logging me into random accounts (which aren't mine) please fix this..",
        "It's good but most of the beautiful dresses are too expensive.. please decrease the price.. and I liked about the daily deals.",
        "Keeps freezing then closing itself during the games, this new update has flaws. Other than that, it's a lovely game",
        "This app is amaze! But the mini-games are less interesting than in\"my talking tom\""

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

        "Was pretty good, liked the levels and the graphics were cool. The combonation of the colours on the black and white were quite nice. The only problem i had was when it came to the controls. Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",

These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",

        "This is a fun game. I'm still personally waiting on that police chase mode. Also, can there be engine mods and body mods, and some more low end cars?😀"

        "I'm sorry, but you guys are basically obsessed with money.I know, people need money for their needs, but why make a game free when we can hardly do anything?I miss the Dr. Panda Chinese Resturaunt, the whole game was free!Look, i'm not a cheapskate and the other people who disagree with the prices aren't, but y'know most kids play these games, and their parents aren't wealthy.Just please think about my comment for a while.",

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",

Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "If you've seen this game advertised and thought hey that looks fun you'd be wrong. The ads make this look like a fun army survival type game like epic battle simulator. Its not, its just another money sink 'build a fortress' collect resources. Avoid for the sake of your saniy",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

They're not well-distributed, having reached a point where no ads would show up after a few runs, and then one would appear after every run no matter how short. A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "Wow!!!! I've never been more annoyed with an app in my life!!! I would play this game all day long but the amount of ads are literally driving me insane! Two runs and another 15 second ad comes up. No thanks",
        "Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it's good but I've had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling",
        "This game was my favorite of any maybe ever. I played all the time, then there was an update and I had to uninstall. It made the app close constantly (even when it wasn't even open and I was in other apps), there's way too many ads that make me want to vomit, and it stats to lag now when it never did before. Someone at corporate ruined this game. Smh."

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",
        "I've always loved this game, but my tickets go ignored for days. Latest update has handicapped me completely in that I cannot click on anything or log off 1 world to log onto my other world. The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together. To think I've actually spent real money on this game and can't get a timely answer.",

I cannot even access the second world I play in because I am locked into Uceria. I have uninstalled and reinstalled,but still does not work. Please help!",

Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "Supposed random game is not random. You only win the lowest prices until you start spending gold.  Black market is the same. Also it will take you a decade before you get the best robots unless you shell out your hard earned money. I hope the drop off scheme would earn me points, however it's just for one type of robot.",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard"

        "After the latest update, I've only gotten one set of daily quests which populated right after the update. After that, I haven't received any additional daily quest where I can win some gems. Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "I like this game very much but after updation it get worst. It's not fair that   we are playing with level 1 n some are playing with level 10 so disappointed now"

BABIES DON'T COME OUTTA THE STOMACH THEY COME OUTTA THE VA JAY JAY (WITHOUT FRIKEN' DIPERS ON!) AND SECOND, BABIES COME OUT LOOKIN' LIKE A POTATO. THIRD, YOU CAN'T TAKE BATHS WITH DIPERS ON.",
        "I really liked the action scene where the ICE police arrested the mommy and took her children into social services. I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we're able to take care of the premies and foster them until they're adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.",
        "For those who enjoy terrible plot, gameplay, and controls. What is the purpose of this game? It seems to be written  by people unfamiliar with healthy labor and newborn care practices. Yikes. I would be hesitant to let anyone involved in the game design care for my little one. Or help write a birth plan. Or even offer practical parenting advice.",
        "I HATE THIS GAME! I am 9 years old. Do not and I repeat do not download this game. It is so boring I was playing it for not even 8 minutes and I hate it. I finished everything you can do and you just do it again. Do not download this game. ☹",
        "When ever I close it and open again we need to complete all levels again.  Worst",
        "It sucked the mother getting arrested we having to take care of it is all a lie and it was like the worst game ever it could take you four minutes to play literally"

However one problem is the game not unlocking vehicles, maps, and helmets. The biggest example of this is the turbo turtles mission. I am somehow not able to unlock the turtle and skeleton knight even after completing it in various different ways. Even so, this game is an absolute must have for people who want to have a mix of competitiveness and fun!",

        "Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It's a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "As much as I want to love this game, its also quite cheap. Every single race, the same \"real\" players are always there regardless of time of day. They follow the same route and incredibly make no mistakes at all! Meanwhile, I'm getting stuck on every edge, my wheel gets stuck in the ground and every single gate smashes only me. Amazing!! Its a super fun game but don't think for a second that it plays fair.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "Thankyou gor being creative i wish you add more challenge : crash crush. That is like just crush using vlad and rufus (example) and then crush make them crush so who is the winner. Using that game we can know who is the stronger"

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",
        "Well the reason I put a zero on the graphics was bc I didn't get to see them.😢 I just wanted to let you know that I want to request a update on the game maybe just like let people see the video chats and not the pictures. It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry.",
        "Love the whole concept, great how the phone actually rings like someone is calling you. Sadly this main novelty is hidden behind a subscription wall. Advertisements I can deal with but a subscription I point blank refuse."

        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!",
        "There are so many good things to list about this game. First, the graphics are extordinarily beautiful. And how much this game can relax you is AMAZING! When I play this, I swear my stress is gone. This game is never stressful. I find it amazing how satisfying this game is. I also love how realistic this game it is. The veiw and echoing is what really make up this game. Every sound is perfect for the setting. You need to download this NOW!",
        "Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.",
        "Great game, but premium is almost a requirement. The game itself is great, with an uber-cool, never-seen-before concept of smashing glass with metal balls in mysterious dimensions. The only problem is that getting premium is almost a requirement if you want to do well in the game. You can't continue the level once you die without paying. I would rate this game five stars if it weren't for this.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!"

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",

The controls in card battles on the phone are too fiddly, considering there is a lot of unused space on the screen: this would have been developed differently if it wasn't attempting to mimic the desktop version. Lazy! Is the \".. playing over WiFi...\" warning still relevant? Unlimited mobile data and 4g means many of us have as good a connection as fixed line. Love the game, thank you.",

You get good and start to play the end gamers and realize 90% of them are bots with millions of coins and as soon as the game starts you are sent balloons to your side that cannot be activated until round 15+! It's frustrating to earn my coins legit just to have them taken by all the hackers and bots. Ruins the game when makers aren't doing anything about it.",

I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics"

        "Its perfectly awsomely COOL Im already level 27 and i have all of the ninjas but can u please add more space for the other ninjas? That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍",
        "I'm a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission's then Lloyd hacked into Zane's computer he said something I just have a bad memory.",
        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",
        "I love the game it's fantastic but one thing can you please have the feature to ride the vehicles or make your own customer vehicle and could you please add where the ninjas are actually following your character",
        "I think the controls are horrible because I Am left handed and you've got to use your right hand to go forward and there is not much of fighting or ningargo feeling",
        "No controller support on Android TV. Very buggy playing on a tablet. Character gets stuck behind/in objects and you have to kill the game..."

        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played and ever will play. I recommend it to everyone. Even if it doesn't look good to you get it its awsome. I think or know you will like it. Also it's so cute and the graphics are awsome. Also everything is priced so well. I love how you add new stuff often. Also you can level up fast, and let go of your purse into a new family. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!,",
        "OMG THE NEW UPDATE IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY SAW MY OLD REVIEW AND DID ALMOST EVERYRHING I ASKED THEM TO DO OMG LOL XD GREAT GAME!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁 COULD NOT B HAPPIER ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! 😝 Edit: ANOTHER AWSOME UPDATE!!! BEST WOLF SIM IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!! 😆 😆 😆 😀 😁 😁 I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN I LOVE MINECRAFT AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING COMING FROM ME!! 😀 😀 😀 😀 😃 😃 😆 😆 😗 😘 😘 I LOVE U TURBO ROCKET GAMES!! 😘 😘"

I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I'm not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won't make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.",
        "The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app",
        "WAY too many ads.  play 30 seconds, then watch a one minute ad.  Dont really know if i would like the game or not, i never got to play much of it, spent most of my time watching and trying to closeout ads.",
        "First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕",
        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver."

My dad rates tones of games and I'm the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I'm not trying to be mean so don't go crying😢 to ur boss.",

It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",

        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups",
        "This game is the WORST!!! The controls don't work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot"

        "This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It's definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.",
        "Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn't be EA'd. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.",
        "Remove the paywall and just charge for the game, it's worth it and people will buy it. But the way you can't unlock ponies without paying is insulting. Such a shame... I'll be sure to avoid any games you make in the future. And, yes, that's a bit harsh. But if we all don't stop letting devs get away with this kind of thing every company will turn into EA and will ruin the fun of gaming.",
        "Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.",
        "Why advertise the game as \"free\" when it really isn't?  You can only get so far with the \"free ponies\" before you hit a pay wall that requires parents to purchase additional ponies to finish the quest.  The reason I say \"free ponies\" is that your child is subjected to a ridiculous amount of ads in order to play. The only way to get rid of the ads is to buy the ponies.  Even though my daughter loves the game and it's easy for a 5 year old to play, I had to uninstall it due to the ad content.  You really should be more careful who you solicit ads from for content designed for children under 8."

        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I'm going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again."

        "Really enjoy playing this game so addictive. I currently play it on a samsung galaxy phone and I'm over 400 levels played. I am  going to be changing phones over to iphone and wondered if I could download game and carry on where I left off, or would I have to start all over again? Hope not.",
        "I was a devoted player to Blast solitaire but this game has it beat. I love the challenge games as well as the journey to getting more gardens. Wish there were ways to get free wildcards? I hate paying that six grand for a help card. But I am addicted and I highly recommend it!",
        "Love the game but I think the bonus levels to unlock gold crops should be heaps cheaper to play. Some of them are hard and you run out of money to keep trying them as they cost as much as a normal level to play.",
        "It looks good and the gameplay is fun. Unfortunately that fun only lasts so long before the game devolves into micro transaction hell. Each round gets so expensive that I can only play one or two unless I were to buy coin packs. These guys should be ashamed.",
        "Really fun game but costs too many credits to play and the extra five cards and wild are over priced considering the cost of credits per game round. Could be better if these issues get resolved I would edit my review to five stars all around.",
        "It is a fun game. BUT, the levels cost so many coins that it's very slow. Unless you plan to pay real money or can win every level 1st try, expect to play maybe 1 game an hour."

        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you're in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "Update: so I've been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They're twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you're unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.",
        "The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks",
        "People have low requirements nowadays. This game doesn't deserve a 4.4 rating. It feels good as long as I stay in the menu (even with the weird japanese mascot) but once the game loads it gets horrible. The camera angles are terrible, the cars feel like toys in the overscaled world, the car's softshadow is terribly aligned and the physics simulation is just mediocre. The whole game is just a mediocre clone of Asphalt 8, I don't understand why people choose an inferior copy instead of the original one..."

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",

        "Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I'm very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it.",
        "I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.",
        "Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I've only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.",
        "I'm not quite sure what's happened to this game. It's very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android's OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it's going, now it's just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it's own update."

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game."

I UNINSTALLED this game and my phone is back to normal. Not worth screwing up your phone. It's a bit fun but there are other games out there.",

Now had to start again (which is not such a big problem), but then the game glitches and I don't get anything for leveling. Meaning I can't get past car level 4 anymore, because there are simply not enough parking spaces. Will give 5 stars if this gets fixed.",

But its good,  I think what sets thia one apart from the other tap to play games is the frequency of bonuses. While granite not the best for your phones battery life. The bonuses come very frequently and add an appeal to the game I haven't found with others. This is day one though so keep that in mind. Good rates from me though on first play",

        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "Must be the shortest time I have had a game installed. Pace of gameplay is SLOW and I hate the voice of the game. So annoying! If I could skip the animation before and after a level it would be much better.",
        "Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.",
        "Liked it but sometimes it just wouldn't give me the right bubbles to win at the end when I absolutely could've. If there's 4 bubbles left and none of them are yellow why do you give me a yellow one? I felt cheated",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item."

Edit after reply* wow not even an apology for someone who paid. Kind sir, then please at least let your consumers know that there are actually 2 kind of ads instead of just simply stating 1? No Tom dick or harry will know that unless you state it. Good day.",
        "The only issue i had is the back button when tamagochi sleep. It make auto-wake state when i push the back button. It would be nice if even i push the back button tamagochi still sleeping instead wake up and also option for how long they sleep like 4,6,8 hours. I'll change the rating after the back button issue has fix. Btw the game is good, you should add adventure or something like that.",
        "Good nostalgia, awesome graphics but needs better execution. Allow optional interactivity with friends, for example. The main point of using a smartphone is connectivity. Make earning anything easier, this will increase the replay value. Your game will become popular by word of mouth, I tell you. Don't make it a quick cash grab. Think about how you can keep the game afloat instead of having to scrap it and start anew if it fails.",
        "I did a YouTube video over this app. Overall Tamagotchi Forever is fun. But ads and lack of things to do made this app a miss opportunity for the creators. I do like optional ads. But the ads at the top and in between screens are lame. Also for an app like this cosmetics are the perfect thing to add, but they limit the costumes to about 3 each character. Another nice thing that would've been cool to see would've been decorating your house & visiting friends. These other things would've made the app great.",
        "I can't see ur advise is helping me, none of them. Back button will appear after i press phone's back button. And it makes my pet wakes from his sleep.  And yes, we can collect all of the character but we can't interract with other player, we ONLY can collect and evolve them, not like in tamagotchi v7 if u know what i mean.  Unistalling this game"

I upgraded my mini van like 3 times and it's still lvl 1. Not sure if it's just that certain tower or what... But otherwise love it!😛😉🔥😀",

        "Fun game so far but one issue I think I have is the performance for some reasons when I'm playing if I attack a camp it gets SUPER laggy and it runs smoothly when I'm not attacking and just upgrading the camp. And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon. It's a good game but you've been warned..."

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",

I've been playing pretty much from the first version and have yet to find a fuel tank for my motorcycle. the developers either just don't listen to the people playing the game and address the problems people have with the game or don't care. with every update it's becoming more and more obvious they're more concerned with how to get more money out of players that are willing to spend it.",
        "Dog update just lost all my data including motorcycle, nearly finished acid bath, and atv, cement base with maxed out trunks, loads of stuff. Played every day for months to have it all wiped away in 1 update. They have done this repeatedly to others and yes it was connected to playstore. I have restored it before. This time it doesnt connect!",

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",

I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D"

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

Otherwise it's a fun game, but you won't get past the ads for too long without uninstalling likely.",

        "Love the concept.. but its way to buggy with way to many ads  . It really spoils the game.. good or now will see.. but it concerns me with so many adds with every move.. is it letting spammers in",

        "Great idea to bring all the puzzles together into one app. The ads can get a little excessive at times, but you get used to it fast. The 10 puzzles for 25 coins is a very nice idea to encourage you to do more puzzles to get those coins! I haven't bumped into any problems with this game yet, so that's good! I entirely recommend this game for anybody who likes puzzles, novice or advanced! :)",
        "I love a lot of the puzzles on offer and the fact that you can earn plenty of coins along the way to use for hints when you get stuck. But some of the hints for some of the puzzles are extremely confusing to figure out, meaning I've gotten stuck with several of the puzzles and this is very disappointing for me.",
        "This game is alot of fun in my opinion and it has a whole bunch of diffrente games/challenges. But the ads are a bit of a problem and i don't know if this happend to you but it should me the same ad every time.",
        "I love this game! I love how there are so many puzzles and how new ones are being added all the time. I've read some reviews and I do admit that there is a lot of ads, but for the most part I don't really mind it. I don't know if its just my type of phone or not, but I can usually skip these ads pretty quickly. So yeah this is a great app! Keep up the great work!",
        "Love it! *UPDATED REVIEW * i would like to retract my first review as the game no longer works. I had gotten a far way into the game but now the game won't load or even open. Very disappointing.",
        "The game may be great. I don't know as I haven't played it yet. The first thing that happened when I started it up was that I saw an ad for Grindr. The game is a PEGI 3. This is an entirely inappropriate ad for a game rated like this. My 7 year old daughter would love to play these games but unfortunately I won't be letting her. Very cross."

With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

All other puzzle improve your skills but this isn't since you have no time to caulate the expression it's more a test of memory then calculation because you can only 3 star it if you know the expression by heart if you try workout you answer right but run out of time. You should make is so each correct answer adds time so you can accurately l improve. Also most games are broken with not enough time to do the given task and workout same as previous has no buttons so you can't play it.",

Star ratings give the game good replay value, and the workout mode is a nice addition for something short and sweet. Ads can get a bit annoying, but there's not too many and the pro version isn't that expensive anyway. As for the skill-building element, I can definitely see a difference in my attention and reflexes since playing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.",

You have to aim like 30 feet above your opponent and hope that you are lobbing the knife high enough to make it there. Sometimes I would somehow win a round without even throwing a knife. Other times I'd die in the first second of play after being hit 1 time but it would take me at least 3 hits to kill my opponent. Watched a video for a free crate and then the game went back to the startup screen like it was rebooting and i had to watch another to open it. Not very much to do either. Im out.",

It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!",

I simply logged in using the same info as when I purchased it. Give it a try. Only real complaint I have is a recent event. I've purchased all unlocks and until now extras, even enjoy the pc version but now even after I've handed out funds they want more money to enjoy features. When I purchased unlocks and extras the last thing I wanna hear is we've added more unlocks for more money, even though you already paid for unlocks.",

In order to progress in the game you basically need to purchase the full version 3.) The fungus level is definitely the hardest to get past, played at least 10+ times and still have not won that level because it doesn't give you enough DNA to upgrade. 4.) Game is overall, Ok.  5.) I like the new levels! Like the vampire and ape one. It's pretty cool."

        "Really enjoying this. Difficult but not annoying. I recommend buying the basic starter pack which gets rid of necessary ads, but you can still watch ads to get more coins etc.. Which is smart I think. Gameplay is pretty fun and responsive. Upgrades don't feel unattainable. Definitely one of the better games on the play store",
        "There is a sudden difficulty spike in this game around level 20. Even if u have the best ship and weapons ur no match for the hordes of enemies. This is not right. Even after spending money the developers dont want you to win in my opinion. Dont know whats the logic.",
        "It's almost nothing without buying coins, u cant even win normal difficulty without ads and purchasing coins, how r we supposed to upgrade our weapons when every map gives u only around 200 and u need 20000 after a while for only one upgrade????!!!!!! Its graphic and gameplay is really good but like I said no progress in winning after a few maps",
        "It's simply too difficult to see when your finger is in the way.   Is there a fix? No.  Fun game. Too hard for my taste.  My $0.02",
        "Stuck on level 32. Theres no way past this level without spending some bucks (crazy prices). Hate the fact that there is no other way, but to  pay for the best upgrades.",
        "Well I can't be mental, I am physically disabled, only this body is disabled, but we can think, ask somebody mental to play pass level 21 plus, we  did pass 21 plus LEVELS.  No disrespect to anybody mental/physically disabled."

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",
        "In the world of cafe games this one is a gem that stands out like a diamond in the rough. Fun and easy to play, it's set at a relaxing pace with you learning new recipes and chatting with your customers.

        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Great game thanks. as smooth as we like it well-done. To google players if you are  looking for action GTA 5 style then this is the game for you. I can't wait to get home from work every night make a brew and chill on this till I run out of battery lol class A game. (Again thank you for making this game) can't wait for updates fingers crossed",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6"

Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",
        "Lack of game play is what gets me. Don't get me wrong, it's a smart tactic. Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",
        "It was a good game. Too bad it doesnt open now after the update. It says something below the logo screen and then dissapears too fast you cant read it. And when it goes to the gear connecting thing to try to connect it crashes.",
        "Can you guys pls fix the game because when I started to play then while its loading THE GAME GOT CRASH! The oldest version work for me but this version it didn't work. Thx to read this.",
        "It's a great game, it has good graphics and awesome cars. But one thing that I don't get after I have downloaded it why do I still need to purchase it.... really that's not cool....if people found out about this they may end up uninstalling the app....if only you could give it to me for free."

        "It s a good game , by a good company,many options (that many options that I have not tried each and every one!) But I have rated it 3 stars as:- no 1:- there comes an ad after each and every nail you design , sometimes even after every step you do! Due to that one star Gone and no 2 :-When you are making designs on the nail , you cannot make strips , hearts , umbrellas and stiff you can design with shiny nail polish , I wish we could do that also and now because of these two things , two WHOLE stars gone , only three stars left.",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

I probably would have continued to play but the sheer number of advertisements and some coding logic that makes it annoying after every game to wait for the ad to go and to even after selecting the Google account, it keeps asking for that... It's become annoying beyond the point for me to continue. Otherwise, great game.",
        "Really good and fun game, but there is a major bug, with what you can play for ever: You can just close the game if you miss (as long as balls are still rolling) and when the game is restarted, you get a new chance. Ever and ever again ..",

        "Too many adds and the fact that you can't see the different patterns of the balls you unlock is somewhat annoying, still is a ok game to waste your time with."

I really loved but I wasn't able to play it again. You guys should update it to where your able to play the game whenever you want and not havw to pay for it cause the game is the kind i was looking for, for a long time. This is just disappointing.",

        "Love this game and the horses!!🐴",
        "I enjoy star stable horses, it's an enjoyable game. However I have two suggestions.   Firstly, the first horse a player transfers over to their account should be either free or cheaper because, not every player is a star rider and not everyone has as many star coins as a star rider player. So I believe this would make non-star rider players find star stable horses enjoyable and more satisfying once they've reached level 10 and transferred a horse to their star stable online account.  Secondly, there could be a star coins daily spinner. This of course should not be accessible to star riders and only available to non-star riders who do not have the money to buy star rider or star coins. The daily spinner could increase the star coins amount maybe 5% a day possibly till a certain day, for example day 10, and if the player misses a day, the spinner will reset to day 1.   Overall, I love this game, it is fun and the horse's graphics are amazing. The tasks are quite easy to do and not too complicated for younger players. I look foward to future horse and updates with star stable horses.",
        "I love how you let  us get 2 horses, but we should be able to keep the horses without signing in for star stable online. Also, why do we have to wait 24 hours 2 train our horses. But any way it is a GREAT  game!🐎🏇🏇👍👍👍👏",
        "I'm giving up!!. Can't get through most of the training tasks. They don't help or update. Boring as hell. You do the same thing over and over again. Horse is pretty, but the game's not worth playing."

They both show completed and say that they've given me the reward.... but they haven't.   I disputed it.   Waiting two weeks on one of them and one week for the other.  This is racketeering.  I've been hoodwinked.. bamboozled!  I'll change my my review after they give me my CASH$$",

Got 3 stars got 3 stars but when I went to go to the next level it show only 2.   Levels 8 thru 12 I won first time. Level 13 I lost and the same thing happened as level 7.  Other than that I really like the game.  Very cute graphics.",
        "I get to No. 1400 and it stalled. I've tried everything and it says I failed. It states I have so many balls, but when I shoot 5 or 6, I am out, and then it says I failed. I would loved to go further, but will Uninstall until it is fixed. I really wanted to see just how far I could go.",

        "The art style is amazing. The Zen mode and overall atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining. My big issue is after resetting my progress once I completed everything. You loose the coin doubling upgrade that you pay real money for. Why must I re purchase some I have already bought. Why does resetting my progress reset something I purchased with real money. I feel that is a little unfair and even from a premium purchaser is pretty jading, I really enjoy the game and will change to a 5 star once an answer is provided or it is fixed.",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Echoing what many others are saying, the ads completely break this game. I understand I'm not paying for the game, so I don't mind being shown ads.  However the button to close the apps rarely function properly.  Instead of closing the ad it takes you to the download page of the ad being advertised. Update: I just had to sit through a round of a final fantasy game.  I wish you could rate below the 1 star.",
        "The game itself is fun and minimally challenging.  The graphics are lovely.  I felt compelled to give such a low rating due to the ads not clearing out upon completion.  I had to close the app and restart just to play the game again.  I would have purchased the ad-free version but if it's this buggy prior to purchase, I didn't want to get stuck with a pay version that I'm unable to clear out certain functions.  Maybe next time.",
        "I remember back when this game would cost money on iOS. I would literally try to download every single third party helper app just to look for this game. Now that i actually have a phone, its free. I think this game is great for both relaxing and competitive play. And I am so hyped for the Odyssey. I check often to see if it is there. 10/10 would recommend this game."

        "The level design is fine and the graphics is nice to look at. I like that it isn't always a course of multiple levels, but individual levels, it fits better for an on the go game. My main problem is with the controls and physics. You can hit a wall straight on and instead of bouncing back, like you would expect, it slows the ball down to a stop and just roll it a little to the side, these unpredictable physics make it hard to determine where your ball will go. And the camera controls is quite annoying, the swiping is way more intuitive and natural but is way too slow for turning 180 degrees. The button controls is too fast when trying to precision your shot.  These issues are, for me, a deal breaker and is the reason why I will not be playing this again. Though the gameplay was enjoyable when working. I have been looking for a casual golf game, and hoped this could be it, based on the more than stellar reviews.",

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5",
        "this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",

        "Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",
        "It's a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don't like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀"

Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."

It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it.

Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going.

After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "This game is very nicely done. Its a genius concept except the fact that u catch zombies to make it into something is really gross. I would preffer if you could lower the pri e of the drone a bit so that there would be more play time rather than waiting play. Overall this game is superb",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested."

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",

Yea, snark.",

Game fairly generous on gifts tho I do pay real money too. Great to see the older version of the owl bubbles in the games have come back. They are so much nicer looking and easier to spot than the new ones you tried in February. Thank u 4listening to feedback.",

If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can't use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.",
        "Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don't work!.... I'll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.",
        "I'm very unhappy!! Since the update my daughter can no longer play with the babies I bought, only the free ones. She is constantly bugging me to buy them again, but since I have already purchased them I do not think I should have to. Please may I have a full refund so I can purchase again or better yet fix the problem, then I can give 5*",
        "Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.",
        "Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn't recommend this app because of that... it's just stealing my money..",
        "Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!"

        "This game activitly makes me angry. I want to keep playing it but the longer I play the less accurate my ship becomes, eventually missing EVERY SHOT, EVERY TIME. It feels likes the longer you play the game the less effect your ship becomes. It's a fun game but seems like a pretty intense cash grab.",
        "Decent, not good. Enemy flags might as well not exist as they don't fight eachother. You'll end up getting swarmed by every ship that always go faster than you, no matter how much you upgrade speed. They ram You constantly dealing damage but then take no damage from when you ram them. They also aren't affected by friendly fire. You can't actually aim and the constant ads are very annoying.",
        "Easy to play game. Good graphics. Controls can be a bit fiddly, but not that hard to deal with. If playing solidly for a while (30+ minutes), the cannon firing timing stops working properly and all shots miss (except for the enemies!) - restart the game and problem resolves, but a frustrating little bug.",
        "This game is amazing. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played on mobile. Also, you don't need to spend any money! I got to a fully maxed out ships without spending a cent. One thing you guys should add is multiplayer and different style ships, maybe Viking or something. Otherwise great game.",
        "DON'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS AND THE RATINGS. They are artificially inflated. The game itself is okay, but nothing special or super fun. 1 star because of the false rating otherwise a solid 3 (simple and uninvolving arcade ship shooter)"

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I love the game, it's so addictive! Some of the levels are confusing, but most are super simple and super fun! One thing that is a little bit of a downer is how every time you want to play a new round you have to watch a 30 second add , which gets old when you want to play a lot, but don't want to pay for add free. But I would highly recomend this to anyone",
        "This game is so good but please get rid of some adverts. Whenever I click on somthing it always comes up with a long advert. Also, can you add a toutorial at the start, showing how to do each thing.",

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "So far I've been enjoying it. It's nothing too special, typical mobile fighting game but Tekken. The fact that's it Tekken makes it more enjoyable than average because I love Tekken, but that's just me. I feel that acquiring new characters needs to be way easier than it is, especially when you need to take on harder missions for bonus materials and currency. I don't like how you have to wait for characters health to regenerate. If characters healths auto filled per mission, I would definitely put more time into the game. Since it isn't, I have to constantly stop playing and wait for the health to refill, and I don't wait to use healing items because it takes away from my in game currency, which itself is difficult to obtain if you aren't constantly grinding. Aside from that, it's fun. Very fun, I recommend.",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard."

        "This game is so awesome. Everytime my sister clocks im on my phone she starts screaming then suddenly she stops. Why? Because i just gave her the phone and she's playing this game. Love it so much plz make another game like that ive got another sister whos 1 and is gonna start screaming too soon😁😁",
        "Amazingly Awesome!!! Dear Entertaining One,Your Game is Really Nice.But,if you can,please add more characters in the next update like Mommy Pig,Daddy Pig,Grandma Pig and Grandpa Pig because I want to see what they do,like Peppa and George.Both siblings oink or laugh,and that's why I want to add more characters.Even though I'm 10,this game is awesome! Again,thank for this game and God Bless You All. Love,Daylight Sunshine"

        "I felt like this be could have so much potential! I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",

Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",

        "I really like the concept of the game I fun to play. But what I really find droubling its a pay to win type of game. Sure you get daily rewards and everything, but that still doesn't compare to the lack of coins you get. For example I recently reached lvl 11, and when I go into lobbies with people with high tier amor and weapons. I find It hard to get kills now. I really hope you guys can fix this in the further future",
        "I think it's OK, I mean like, its just a copy of pixel gun 3D but there's more action in pixel gun. And could you make the fire button a little bigger because whenever I try to fire I always miss the trigger and then get killed😬 but I still like pixel gun better (sorry alot) but I think the game needs more improvement that's why I gave it a 3 star",
        "I hate this You need to get report or find a mod. see in the chat a player keep calling me gay for 17 day I will 5 star it if you can do it",
        "I will u 5* if u increase the amount of coins every match and reduce price of weapons & armours. Amount of coins every match is so little that I can't buy a good weapon and also armor repair and also granede buying system is so pathetic.",
        "Its awesome, but the armor repair... really why? People are going to start hating that. Which happened to me and some others. Also add a friends list. Keep it up",
        "It's a good game u can meet a bunch of people around the world! Like slaughter not I met him and be careful what I say all right because I got blocked 2 times under 1 week lol bye"

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Addicted to this game since I downloaded it, even got my other half playing it! The main issue of this game is that, you always shut down the serves to do maintenance or updates whilst there are events and clan events on! Many people use alot of gems etc during these events but you're putting players off from doing that by messing around with something that's working perfectly! Aside from that issue, it is very enjoyable to play.  UPDATE: Why do you bother making updates for the game, for the game to then stop working! I was told i had to update if I wanted to continue playing this game, so I downloaded the update and now the game won't start at all! I'll add my other star back to the review once this is sorted!"

        "This has a lot of potential. Connection issues are horrendous after this last update. Also, add a help section that explains what everything means. Lots of stats, numbers, ratings, etc. that we have to figure out on our own. Another thing, stopped receiving notifications after updating to Oreo.",
        "Overall it's pretty fun and addicting.  My only real issue came up with today's update. My 40-rated team got matched to play against a 60-rated team in my first Challenge game. wut",
        "The game was great until the update. Took my team from a 43 to a 41. Put alot of time into it, hope this gets worked out. They also nerfed training. Don't even bother wasting 15 coins on an extra session.",
        "Update: ***500 coins for ~350k in game cash isnt even 1 rookie signing.... you can get 3 star players for that kind of coin. **** the latest updates have added cool new features like the coach analysis, fewer bugs and more consistency. The coach analysis function could be cool but every description is \"this player is making great progress, keep pushing him!\" Even for aging players who are getting worse as the seasons progress. It does however project where the player could trend stats wise.  Still no goalie stats. Still no trade options (not sure how that would wotk) but they added refunds to contracts you release from your roster which depend on the player and their contract value,  time remaining etc...  Would be cool to also be able to make in game adjustments, like if your star goalie is letting goal after goal slip through swapping goal tenders would be nice otherwise there doesn't really seem to be a point in having 2 goalies even on the roster.  Overall it's a Fun game with a LOT of potential, if you're a fan of hockey you should definitely give this a try. Would like to see some of these things as the game develops",
        "Please fix how it automatically signs a new player if you don't renew a contract.. the purpose is to dump cap space and it signs some random player and then won't let me release him.  Also STOP changing my line ups. At any point any time ever. There's no need to change it or else you night as well play the game for me. I spend alot of time re doing them and then next thing I know every thing is changed. Not sure why or what causes it buy it is annoying as hell",
        "Overall it is a decent game. However finding an opponent for the games especially the rank games sucks. Either you get another player who is far superior to you or another who is far below your level. It needs to be more equal to be fun."

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "I'm surprised this game scores so well. It's an exercise in drawing/scribbling, not physics. The puzzles are very one dimensional and most of them are solved by trial and error over thought and skill. It's a novel idea but given what else is available out there I wouldn't pay a penny for this game as it lacks innovation, originality and just feels very dated.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it."

        "I find it a little tricky to navigate sometimes, since it makes my on-screen navigation bar disappear. I like it but maybe I would like it more if there was a back arrow? Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",
        "Really disappointed. I played the party game to win the St Patrick's badge. I came 2nd place when it finished and ift said I had won a badge but it doesn't appear in my badge collection. Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. 😟",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",
        "I haven't been able to change my profile picture since December. I keep getting an error. I thought the most recent update would fix it, but still am not able.",
        "My wife and I both bought power ups yesterday March 17. Big sale right?  I had 20 something already and only ended up with 133 after buying 180. My wife bought \"180\"  twice thinking she may have made a mistake the first time and only ended up with about 300 total. She already had quite a few to begin with. Ripoff!"

        "Can one also be able yo take turns??  I dont like it straight all the way to nowere. And brake should be fully efective one should STOP anytime he wants and also dont sale cars it should just be affordable by coins  Its really a gr8 game but only a little more work.",
        "The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .",
        "Basic. You have to over take cars... That's it. When they talk about the physics being like simulation they are lieing. Left right go stop. Poor 16bit sound that you will want to turn off. It's like a game from the 80s. Uninstall.",
        "The game is very good but I really wish if the score is for the overtakes as well as the high speed that will be a lot better. Also, I wish if there were more cars. That would be really interesting. Actually it needs a lot of work because it's very boring",
        "Hey, this game is just so good, just make few improvements like, try to create bends in your highway and add more cars, a little road features like tunnels, two way traffic feature. This way you will have killed me. gameplay is so nice anyway."

Ads should not pop up during a timed game. Put them after a puzzle is finished. This tells me the game maker cares more about the ads than user experience. I'm sure the company will point out that I can pay to remove the ads. Why would I pay for a game with a limited number of puzzles? Ad revenue should be enough, but ads should not be obtrusive and interfere with game play.",

I've actually stopped my daughter playing it due to words like knife school iraqi dead etc all in one puzzle! Feels almost like a warning!!!

The wins are far below expectations. in other words, the wins are way below the amount of coins spent. That's a turnoff for me. You wait so long for the bonus and get almost nothing in return. Can you please modify it so it pays a little better? All else great, the graphics, sounds and choices of slots.",

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again."

        "Fun game to play. I don't like new high stakes betting. You never win and lose your coins really fast. Don't waste your real money to buy coins because they won't last either. Glad they raised free coins you but now machines don't pay out as often. Have fun with your free coins and this is a good time.",
        "I use to love! this game, it was the one game that did not cheat you out of your coins now the game is red it doesn't stop when you wanted to stop some lines stick together in the game or if you push the game to stop it continues to roll that's cheating that's literally cheating people out of their money now the game sucks I would never buy coins to play this game again. I will only play with the coins this game allow me thank you",
        "I have been enjoying all the different things that are going on while I'm in play. I like that I'm playing for more than just credits!  I'm not just sticking around The same.number of credits...I don't like a lot of the gaming apps out there....they bore me quickly! I keep catching myself saying, \"ok... Just a couple more spins and I'll close it up and get something  done today....\"  Then I'll level up to unlock a new game... And who just closes the app -&gt;before at least checking it out first, Right? (kinda like hitting a baseball out of the park and walking over to the concession stands to buy some nachos before running the bases in Victory!) graphics are clear! Bonuses are fun! Good Job on putting together A Fantastic Gaming App!",
        "I just began playing Pharaoh's way tonight, I love everything about it except the two times it tried to show me some special things that are going on in the game, it freezes up and won't let me play until I completely shut it down and reboot the app. I hope you can resolve this problem! If you can, it'll be a next to perfect gaming app!",
        "Its coo!! Luv luv it! Arent we bout due 4 a new slot by y'all?!! And btw, them dayz y'all unlock all the slots 4 us 2 play, literally blow my mind! Keeps me playin waitin 4 the next day...its frequent & that is totally dream!!!! Thank U!!!! ✌️👍❣️"

        "Love it! Sure, it has auto battle and auto guide for missions, but it can be turned off if you are really picky about that. It has much more choices in class, and highly customizable.   There is a bunch of other awesome features that you don't even need to spend money on, so I myself would recommend this game to those who like this sort of thing!   Thanks developers, you're awesome!",
        "Servers seem to be stabilizing so I'm going to change my 1 star review to 3. This game would have been great if they used the same graphics as the story. In this day and age developers have made huge leaps forward in the department and this game doesn't show it. Its jam packed with things to do, customization and other things. If they update the graphics this game would be the masterpiece that it needs to be!",
        "Doesn't seem to work on my mobile data? I don't have high-speed, but other MMORPGs work perfectly fine on average speed. I get the error message \"Server Connection Lost (0)-1\" or something every time I load it, and have yet to get farther than the loading screen (where the current event pop-up comes on, after the download loading screen.) I was really looking forward to playing. If I can get the app to work (going to try online tomorrow!), I'll happily change my review! I'd really like this to work on my data, though; I don't have wifi at home.",
        "Fantastic game it takes some time to get used to the camera angles (It would be even better if you could rotate the camera around your character, it improves the atmosphere). Combat is ... Well it takes time to get used to that too that could use some improvements. Character design is good I like it Story is good also (Still progressing). Overall great game few small updates and changes will make it a even better game.",
        "Great game. It's a good port of the aura kingdom pc. It has nice graphics, options for auto questing and auto path finding for those who needs it, a nice story line, and it's f2p players friendly with the gifts from events and a fair eidolon gacha. Paying is not needed, but can be done if you wanted. Overall a nice game. I'm waiting for the next updates :)",
        "Just as a personal opinion, a 60 fps option would be a good  initial long term patch to be working on. Also you need to realize the fan base your working with, I haven't played the pc version but it looks like some of your fans transitioning from pc top mobile aren't very happy.  Also the mobile rpg type game fans are pretty hard to please initially, we've probably been through tons of other games with the same approach as you. Other than that I would think about how to polish the game up a bit more, maybe look at other games and see what elements make them look polished verses your own game?"

        "It s a good game , by a good company,many options (that many options that I have not tried each and every one!) But I have rated it 3 stars as:- no 1:- there comes an ad after each and every nail you design , sometimes even after every step you do! Due to that one star Gone and no 2 :-When you are making designs on the nail , you cannot make strips , hearts , umbrellas and stiff you can design with shiny nail polish , I wish we could do that also and now because of these two things , two WHOLE stars gone , only three stars left.",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

        "It's great fun!! My only problem is when I watch first position in events those fast bikes look really fake. I hope it's just how it looks and it's not the actual game physics when I unlock those bikes. My biggest problem is tournaments. They have different categories for entry cost but the high speed players can still enter and win any tier tournament below Thier skill level. They should not be allowed to dominate lower tier players",
        "If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don't mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.",
        "Great game. Only criticism is, when your racing with other players where there are lifts etc. They can bypass the lift and go over water like it's just not there. And like others have said during tournaments the leader is like 10 seconds faster and supposedly on the same bike. There must be hackers there is no way at all the bikes fly or hover. Come on guys get a grip on this so it's fair for everyone",
        "I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It's miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi",
        "Bit hard to get used to at first. But when the bikes been upgraded and Machu Pichu opened game gets much more enjoyable and less frustrating. Smoth graphics with good gameplay. Any purchase gets rid of ads but at nearly £5 for cheapest purchase it's a bit steep (and you get very little for your £5). But, all in all, a very good game that's worth sticking with.",
        "Cherishable app! I love it, just some minor problems: - Has plenty ads and never skip once when quite competition.  - Its controls should be customizable.  - Partners' profiles should be viewable.      Thank you for your help!"

        "Really enjoy this game but its very hard to do well unless you pay real money to buy extras! There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "The app is really good. It's addictive. But, I really feel they should give out cash or diamonds more easily. If we could earn diamonds or cash for watching a video then it would be great. Cause it takes time for the looks to get voted and until then we cannot play and wait for the diamonds. It's kinda sad. Hope they'll look into this.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5☆"

        "Clash of clan pak 11 from 250 up to 5150... How the hell? Our clan tried and still we received nothing. I was way over the 500 points to get the legendary pack but no I don't get it. Your replies seem to be automated with certain words triggering certain responses. Sort your stuff out people, get your house in order and give us what we deserve. Our legendary bonnet head. I will be uninstalling if you don't come around",
        "Fun game. Good graphics, and overall good fishing simulator. However, its ridiculously rigged. I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",
        "OUT OF ALL THE FISHING GAMES THAT ARE ON THE APP STORE I'VE FOUND ONLY 3 WORTH PLAYING,AND THIS MY FRIENDS IS ONE OF THEM!!!!!!! IT'S A MUST DOWNLOAD AND TRY FISHING GAME/APP!! GREAT GRAPHICS, AND DESIGN!!! IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS FISHING GAME/APP THEN YOU ARE MISSY OUT ON A FANTASTIC DAY OF FISHING!!!!  SO STOP READING AND GET TO DOWNLOADING THIS APP, AND GET TO ALL THE INCREASABLE FISHING FUN!!!!!!😎😋🤣😄😅😁😂🤗😜😛😌😳😱😰",
        "This game is so AWESOME! This game will also teach you alot about the fish you are catching. Great time killer. Just becareful you'll kill to much time. LOL I just realized it's 2:04am. I have to be at work at 6:00am. Download this game now! Thank you for making an AMAZING fishing game. Hats off to the creater's",
        "This game is great and what it does, massive castles sprawling battles across the ages with wizards on dragons back firing missiles at unicorns below... Erm it's fishing they lured me in and I'm hooked, what else is there to say. Great game.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

        "Waste of a license. You'd think a game based on a movie about a game would involve some of the elements of the movies or the game but no, it's just an exact clone of the Pirate Wars game with  Clash of Clans rewards and card levelling mechanics but much worse than either and with a Jumanji skin thrown over it to grab extra cash.  You want to compete? Better get that second mortgage because this game is strictly p2w.  *Edit* Since several updates, opening a bag takes almost as long as unlocking it - loading - loading - loading.",
        "Great time killer. Graphics are pretty good. Opening the backpacks gets monotonous, it would be better with less graphics or if it were just faster. Keep up the great work guys.",
        "Love the game but please lower the power of the Scorpion card. If some gets first roll and uses it there's no coming back from it. Far too overpowered",
        "Untuk kartu legendaris penaklukan peralatan curang dan membuat game jadi tidak fair....yang punya kartu bisa bebas ambil wilayah dengan seenaknya begitu juga kartu legendaris kalajengking gak fair mematikan kartu lawan hingga lawan gak berkutik....game ini cheating",
        "CRASH, CRASH, CRASH, UNINSTALL!!! Edit March 8th, new update yesterday, works for 3minutes now before crashing. At least it KINDA works now. Could be good, but isn't. March 1st, 2018 @ 7pm eastern time. The game loads, and as soon as I touch ANYTHING it crashes the game, so I reload the game, and again, I touch anything, and the game crashes. A few days ago this started, actually, as soon as I was FORCED to update the game is when it started. A little note for the developers, if the game doesn't work, people won't play and you won't make money off the ads, it's really that simple. You really need to make the game stable before you bring in new content. I haven't played a match in at least a week due to the game crashing. So, ultimatum time I guess, I'll give you a couple days to respond or release another update or I'm just going to delete the game and never come back to it, even if it becomes a viral game (which it won't if it doesn't work for more than 3.5 seconds). Maybe talk to other developers and find out why it's so unstable. Just a suggestion."

Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards. You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

        "Definitely a relieving break from the onslaught of talking Tom spin offs.. This game here is the most redneck tower defense kind of game you could get, and I love that. It's a standard shooting tower defense game, but with variety in enemies and even multiplayer! Who woulda thought?",

I always make sure I download game whenever I upgrade to a new phone...it doesn't bother me to start all over bcuz I could play this game from beginning to end everyday!!

Gosh....what the heck....LOL 😂😂😂😂",

Its like one of those deer or bear or dinosaur (I'm pretty sure they have dinosaur too now lol) shooting games...the ones that have the siiick graphics and the rifle upgrades as u go along... Only this is with fish... And a fishing pole!!! Other then that it's pretty similar to one of those... only with this one u get different tanks to keep ur catches in if u want.. or u can sell em 🤣 I'm happy so far!!!",

But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",
        "Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "This is the best game ever I saw for farming. It haves the controls amd graphics. But still theres problem that whenever I purchase any tractor and sell it after I want another tractor then I cant purchase it. The option of purchasing becomes blur. So please make it better. If I will not see any improvement than I will less the stars rated. Regards Jagdish Gadhvi",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

But this 2 is a rip off game, the 2hr Bonus Game. If u watch most of the time the timer isn't even moving so 2hrs is more like 4 hrs! Just another company 2 RIP U off, STOP Falling for this! STOP allowing them 2 win!"

        "Amazing game I have played it a lot recently. Only problem is when trying to exit the game mid level by swiping from the top or bottom, you hit the ball as well so you lose a life unnecessarily. Also it would be nice to have randomly generated levels Edit: After the most recent update I can't play the game because I get an error message when I start the game. UPDATE: I emailed the developers about this issue and they have not responded after almost 2 weeks",
        "Its hard to swing.... Its very hard to swing.....I like this game, its very fun. I'm conplaing for 2 reasons. Reason 1: Making levels is fun but, it doesn't save your level if your'e exiting the game. Reason 2: The game lags, and its hard to control the ball. So, I'm not saying I don't like this game. its just that its hard to control the ball and swing.",
        "When i first downloaded it, it was an amazing game until around a week into having it this happened. On opening it, the game had a black box with random text on it then when i countiuned on it erased all my data😭",
        "I thought the gameplay was good but the lives system is stupid.  I understand it may add longevity and challenge to the game, but I was playing to relax, and I can't when I have to be pixel perfect with the added pressure of losing lives during the process of trial and error.  You should add a mode where you can play without lives at all, and not a practice mode.",
        "In the current version, I am getting an error in action number 1 in Create Event for obj_init. This only occured after updating to android 8.0. Currently the game is unplayable. Please fix this soon. (Update 3-1-18: issue still persists)",
        "Amazing time-killer. I became sad when I finished all the levels. Pls add more!!"

        "Great game and I love it! However when game is buffing or out of range they take the coins or if in bonus it kicks you out and money is lost and never returned nor does it place you back where you left off. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY! thank you. I still rate it 5 star cause I know you guys are going to handle it.",
        "at first was a blast but as any new slot game it tightens up and harder to level up. graphics are great but i will not buy coins on a daily basis in order to keep playing. so sad that this game turned out to be like the rest of them.",
        "Gameplay is interesting and sort of a hybrid of a Big-Fish-style game and those other too-many-blinky-lights and too-many-mission games. What irks me, though, is that you can't revert back to lower limits when your chips shrink. They may think that will make me buy chips, but they think wrong. One other thing: A game associated with NatGeo should be able to hire proofreaders and copy editors so that grammatical errors don't show up in the game.",
        "I have just started, but I wish that I could understand what or how to play the game better. This is my first slot machine game. And I really don't know how to play yet. Could you put some of the rules on at the first of the game, for us dummies?",
        "I think all these slot games by these ppl make it where you HAVE to buy coins if you want to actually play. Never feel lucky"

One problem that have occured for some time, there's no more english subtitles. I don't know what will be the reason for that, but please bring it back. The cutscenes are not useful if you can't understand it.",

Ive already tried force stop and unstalling and reinstalling it and 80% of the time its a black screen! Please fix it!! It's certainly worth 5 stars if it loaded 100% of the time! Thanks :)",

Can you please allow spaces on the name like  *Otaku world*  Because it would be more better :D  And I like All the character's and the kawaii Ai chan :3  I really do like this game. I love anime and I love how you can chat with your friends. But if you touch the person in the menu like when you touch the Tummy when your on to the next heart. Can she PLEASE say *Baka! Watashi no yo ni watashi ni furenaide kudasai!* If you know what this means. Your Game is very fun ;)",

I would really love it if there was an option to log in using my email account because I don't use Facebook. I'm really scared something might happen to my game progress.",
        "the game is almost perfection, however there are still room for improvement on minor details, like font and in game description as most of the description are cut off half way if too long. also events should be roll out more timely than to throw you ll at one there's too much to focus on. overall the game is great."

        "This is an idle game with effort and pretty fun writing, with a lot of ways to feel rewarded without cracking your wallet. It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "The fast pace of the game keeps you hooked.  They don't throw ads at you but certainly make them available for great benefits.  It's not clunky at all which makes it easy to pick up and play a couple minutes here and there.  It's a ridiculous concept of making money off taxis/fares, heck I'd move to the cab driver profession if I made &gt;$500 million on one fare... but funny and fun nonetheless.",
        "I really like this game a lot. I'm not usually into these idle games, but from all the ones ive tried. Ive enjoyed this one the most. Other then the occasional slow down, it mostly runs great. And the model for ads is very very fair. If you decide to watch and ad, you always get some kind of reward out of it. But its completely optional.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Huge battery drain compared to any other game i have played including the new tekken and sims mobile games which are much more graphical. Will sometimes lose game progress when you completely close the app (so not running in background). Taxi's occasionally get stuck on buildings or vanish off screen completely. If it wasn't for these issues it could be a much better game.",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like."

Upgrades cost a fortune and collecting boxes are few and far between and earning cash with off-road challenges is just a drop in the bucket of money you'll need for an upgrade. I'm not saying everything should be cheap and easy, but should increase cash values or offer other ways to earn cash.",
        "Please go back to the update before the latest one. The previous physics where perfect. Trucks moved and jumped perfectly. And the camera (free camera) followed the truck perfectly in order to see the suspension moving with the terain. Now the camera does not stay where you want it. Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics. I unistalled other games because this is all I spent time with. But now I dont know?",
        "nice! im waiting for long time for the game like this... and this is it. but, please add more common truck like nissan navara, toyota hilux vigo & revo, mitsubishi triton, ford ranger 3.2, isuzu dmax.. and also please fix the mud graphic to more realistic.. thanks..",
        "Hey devs, great game, I think a winter map or just more maps would be awesome as well as an option to sell vehicles rather than just collect them. Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",
        "This game suck because it never work it always lags out and every time it says loading trailer it goes back to my home screen. In my review i mean all of this and hope ypu make your game better so it doesn't suck but for now it does suck.",
        "This game is literally what I have been looking for. This is the perfect offroad game. I just wish that there were A LOT more maps and vehicles to chose from. It's boring to constantly go to the same maps. Also the multiplayer is pretty fun. Expand the maps and create new ones please!"

Edit: it won't allow me to invite friends, I'm able to play one game a day unless I continuously buy more tokens...but with ads after every game, they get funding from them. I installed this game because the reviews were the best, but maybe it's just got a grudge against me!",
        "I understand they are trying to make money off this app, but if you are going to charge someone 320 tickets to play 4 cards, the reward should be more than 70 tickets per win.  I mean, really?! Some people want to play bingo, but want something to work toward without being bored.  I played Bingo story and deleted it, because I had a lot of credits, but EVERY BOARD WAS THE SAME.  Also, the powerups in this game should be limited to what you have available, and not have to purchase because you are out of said power up.  It might make more people play if they are rewarded.  .  I mean the quests saying you will win 600 tickets if you complete the quest, but you're spending on the normal side 280+ tickets, really?  And no other options besides watching ad videos for free credits?  And I'm not saying to add a \"download this app and run it for 3 tickets.  Reach level 300 for 40 tickets.\"  Rant over",
        "Everything would be pretty neat, but there should be another way to get more tickets. I've been stuck at the New York state for several days now, cause I can only replay the first stages with the tickets from the daily bonus.",
        "Love it. The only reason I didn't give 5's across the board is it gets costly per game as you gain levels. The games are way fun and you can play up to 8 cards !!!!!",
        "There should be more ways to get or win more tickets and power-ups. I also think the costs per cards increases too much from board to board. Other than those two issues, I love this game. Would play more if there were other ways to get/win tickets, the purchase costs is ridiculous for the middle/working-class.  I'd rather pay my bills than buy fake in-game tickets that CAN'T win me REAL CASH. Thank you keep up the good work.",
        "It's a fun game. You have to be quick near the end beacause the game seem to end while the caller is still calling the last number. You don't get a penalty for daubing the wrong number."

I suggest that on the \"campaign\" the fights wouldn't be as repetitive, to be different, and not so simplistic. The character designs are marvelous there is no doubt on that. The gameplay and controls are ok besides the repetitive fights. The boss battles are incredible at best. If I would rate it from a 1-10, I would give it an 8. So much potential that can be well executed.",

        "Great Game This game it truley fun to play! I don't understand why the rating is so low for it. The graphics are amazing and I like that you can connect with friends and play together. Honestly even though its a great game I wish we didn't have to wait to get more tokens to play. However if you really like the original game board Monopoly, than I suggest you get this app!! Don't judge a game by its rating!! ((;",
        "Computers players dice rolls feel manipulated. Also needs speed play to eliminate animations and skip to result of computers turn for faster rounds. Boring waiting for computer players to end their turns. Need more explanation of chance cards and swap options. Good concept and sound.. good graphics.. Stamps collected should literally be stamps in passport book.. not chips that doesn't make sense. Anyways I like it but the dice rolls feel pretty fishy.",
        "Needs more coins Game definitely would be a favorite of mine but the lack of coins is a bit disappointing considering how much fun it really is. 1or2 coins just isn't enough and needs some of the authenticity of the old board game Incorporated into it to make for longer gameplay. Hotels, community chest, ect. Then you would have my 5 🌟's.",
        "Good but what's the point? Good gameplay. Good graphics. Quicker than actual monopoly to play... However there is no incentive to win... No leader board, no win lose stats, no rewards, no unlockables... Nothing. So who cares if you come second third or fourth (that's just a loss) ... It should have win 25 games and unlock a different board or background or dice... The game would be worth 5 stars if it gave you reason to play.",
        "Format is good, ability to play the game fairly is poor. Several times I've had a card played against me and did not know, so I couldn't use the 'just say no' card I had. Other times I've tried to use a card in the 3 seconds you get to react, but despite pushing the green tick to activate it - did not work. I lost the last game with 3 cards that I tried to use but couldn't...   Oh yeh, I bought 2 other versions of Monopoly on my galaxy 4 that I can't use on my galaxy 6, so I won't be buying this one..",
        "Could be better I like the concept... you have to wait entirely too long for your coins to regenerate.  Also why can't we play with random people online?  Good game over all but not worth 4 bucks for unlimited play with what is offered.  Basically you can play once per day smh... rethink this please then maybe I will rate it better or even buy it.  Why make it a free game and you really can't play"

Don't get conned into a first experience (its deceptively fun at first, great graphics, good payouts)...then they lead you into buying coins...and suddenly nothing. You can spin any game, at any bet level, even buy more chips but the payouts absolutely disappear. It will  happen to you, trust me.  Beware of Jackpot Party!  THEY FLEECE THEIR PLAYERS!",
        "Got the feeling playing for free is a frowned upon activity. Ads won't play to get free coins, coins I did get went so fast it's just not worth it. I wonder if your advertisers know you block videos from playing. I could understand if it were for real money but this is (WAS) my bathroom game.",
        "Warning: dont spend real money buying credits because you will lose your credyts during bonus rounds. The game wil freeze. You will have to close and if you go back to game, credits are gone. Dont spend real cash. Go to a real casino",
        "I like the bonus upgrade dislike the amount of the bets being raised so high can only play for a very short time because of this so not happy with that part of the upgrade😳im enjoying the newest games very much. I enjoy playing but the amounts to play are much too high",
        "I use to actually win back in the day on this app but now it's about impossible. Also the ad videos for free coins is a complete scam !!!! You receive 200k coins which is basically a spin and you will not win. All free coins from ads will not produce any wins. Please tell me there is not a different payout percentage off the ad coins. But you're making real money from us watching  the ad. Mmmmmmmm....",
        "I wanted to play Jackpot Party.  I have played the game in casinos..  unfortunately I  can't play it because it isn't  there.  I have to play through tons of other games for who knows how long to get to the game to unlock it. If you want to play the game this isn't the place to do it"

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Great game thanks. as smooth as we like it well-done. To google players if you are  looking for action GTA 5 style then this is the game for you. I can't wait to get home from work every night make a brew and chill on this till I run out of battery lol class A game. (Again thank you for making this game) can't wait for updates fingers crossed",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6"

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together. To think I've actually spent real money on this game and can't get a timely answer.",

I cannot even access the second world I play in because I am locked into Uceria. I have uninstalled and reinstalled,but still does not work. Please help!",

        "Overall great game as far as playing is concerned. Major thing that could use work is matchmaking. Currently an 89 overall getting matched against 98-105 overall players. No chance to win and may discourage some people from playing the game. The gameplay is awesome and I have lots of fun, 100% worth your time if you avoid Head-to-head or tournaments (unless you have money or don't mind being poorly matched).",
        "This is my full honest review. Madden Mobile is back!! I'll admit before it was not fun and I complained that you need to pay to win but EA really did good when I came back to play. The game is fun and is somewhat easy to get 100 overall players and now they are bringing back Draft Champs and I have seen early drafts and it looks great. The promos are great. I would like to say great job EA on bringing this game back and making it fun. I always want to play everyday and build my Ultimate Team",
        "I have played this game for 3 seasons now.  I can't even begin to say all that is wrong, but one of the things that stands out most to me, is that your players stats mean nothing.  You spend a lot of time and effort completing events and grinding, and improve your team only to find out that when you play a team way below your level, it seems that that teams players are much faster and tend to play way above their ability.  this game seems to have the liberal bug that everyone is equal.  I am done with this game, don't get caught up with it, it's not worth the waste of your time",
        "Thanks alot EA for this new head to head style. Great to know that all the grinding and work put in is only allowing those who have a 100 overall or better reap the rewards. Everytime playing one of these individuals they have a counter for every single play. This really turns me off to the game.",
        "For the person hoping to find Madden 18, this is the closest thing you are gonna get. Yes, it doesn't have practice mode or my player mode, but it DOES have a incredible roster of players that you bargain for. The graphics are pretty good for a game on a smartphone.  Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE for NFL fans. 10 outta 10.",
        "You know I really like all of the Live Events but when I get these old collectible cards that aren't worth anything I have to cut them one by one. It takes way too long and I've got over a hundred. I would suggest having a way to group delete or in Madden terms \"cut\" the old dead weight."

        "Thank u guys for this game. Best wolf game I've ever played. Highly addictive. Thank u so much.   If u can, it would be nice to be able to make people into friends and pack mates. Edit: thanks for that. Its better than I imagined.  Being able to mate and having to take care of pups would be cool. Like how they have Co-op and PvP tabs, maybe u can have another tab that says survival or something. It can kinda be a mixture of both Co-op and Pvp. Every wolf can be an enemy or a friend. You'd have to hunt and drink to survive or die from lack of it. You and your pack has to protect the pups and keep everyone fed. Maybe there can be weather and habitat differences. Night and day changes. And u have to survive with your pack in the snow, the mountains, the desert, the forest, or in a really big map that has all of it. Idk but it would make having a mate and a pack actually mean something. And taking care of pups would be nice. Just a suggestion. Hope u guys consider it.",
        "OMG love this game so much. For me being up north is amazing u can see real wolves but this game takes it to a new level. I love it so much the pride of the pack is great not only that u can talk to people it's super fun. I'm more of a northern girl I don't like the city but this game is so much like home when I play it while I'm away from home it makes me happy",
        "I LOVE IT AND MADE LOTS OF FRIENDS!! This game is awesome and is time killing too! I love the song when you click the game and it's loading! I also love the wovles too! The only thing I wish it has is more then two places to go...it's the same maps over and over and it's ok I just think there should be more maps or something but over all I love it!! It's amazing! One of my favorite games! You have to play it.",
        "I love that you can use powers but I think there should be more wolf species and more places you can go like the city the artic or the deserts also can you put a large boss so everyone in co-op can kill it and it's really strong so hackers carnt do it themselves. It would be nice to see low level people and high level people hanging out like level 50s and level 10s. Also I wish there was a single player mode other than that make more games!! Like the deer or a Fox in a farm the den could be an abandoned dog den. Make a deer online its been my dream. Plus I have all the games you have made so far. Plz hurry and make a new game now!!!",
        "Pretty chill game 👌👌👌 The way you earn points in PVP is pretty cool too. If you kill someone, you get points depending on how high their level is. If you help to kill them you don't get as much points but you still get some. I haven't experienced any glitches yet. Comtroller can be slightly annoying when trying to escape, but other that that it's cool. ⭐🌟⭐🌟⭐",
        "Giving it 2 stars because I get lag spikes every second for a couple seconds. I can't play like that. Giving it 2 stars only cuz its a game I would play daily. Shame, btw I'm using Note 7 so such a game even on high should run 60fps. I'm on very low and still getting lag spikes."

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

        "Game is great, but every time you die (and that's really easy to do) you need to watch about 22 seconds of ads. Once i got a 15 second ad, but the skip time stayed constant and i had to watch the entire thing. The game also bugs you constantly about connecting your facebook account. So if you want to be able to play without interruptions constantly, you need to pay and connect to a facebook account.",
        "Brilliant, innovative, addictive game BUT please reduce the number of ads. That's why this game is only averaging  3.5* and why I can only give it 4*. People will stop playing very quickly as it currently is. Just take it down to an ad break every end of run. Also a way to easily view all positions on the leader board would be nice. Otherwise the game itself is great.",
        "I would have bought the ad free Version eventually, but it was so annoying even to get used to the game, that I gave up. If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "Too many ads with a skip button that reduces ad time by 10 seconds. Literally, f off, dude. Can't play your game, I play for a minute and than watch an ad for half of that time. Unfair and boring. You almost don't get to play the game. Which is, btw, awesome",
        "Visually satisfying, nice, fitting soundtrack and pretty innovative. One thing is that it's extremely packed with ads. One every round you play. Maybe dial it down a little?  Also, maybe add tail patterns...",
        "Great game, but way too many ads. Please tone it down to 1/3 times dying or something or people will stop playing"

        "Going to give up on this game I have been made to watch the same 30 second ad every other turn. More than half of the time I play this game is the black panther film ad, how many times do I have to watch the same ad...ridiculous overkill. There is no way I will go and see that film now because  your barrage of ads has made me annoyed at the mention of it.",
        "Possibly the worst app I have ever used. Memory hungry, battery draining - the phone actually gets hot! - and you are held to ransom by endless boring repetitive ads, or you pay through the nose to avoid them. But it's Scrabble, a great game, so what can you do? You learn to ignore the ads.    Too many silly words are allowed these days, so it's easier to play, but it remains a great game despite the shortcomings of this due app. But there are far too many adverts.",
        "Notifications don't work. Adverts interfere with game play. Games do not load or refresh properly (seems to be due to loading adverts timing out). Just an awful experience. If EA had any decency they'd make a single payment purchase option for Android users to remove adverts.",
        "Would be 5 stars if I could lose the ads I can deal with ads you can shut off... Having to watch a video is ridiculous. Rather pay a fiver for the app than watch a gin advert 50 times Oh and why is pilates not in the dictionary? It's in Collins online?",
        "Overall, I would not download this game for the following reasons.  Firstly, how come so many words are not recognized? Seriously, June is not a valid word, so are there only 11 months in the year then? However, words like upta do!   Secondly, this app drains battery life as though is using your phone to power a planet. You need to invest in your own power station, if you want to play this game for 10 -15 min sessions.  Thirdly, even for a free app there are too many adverts. I actually forgot I was playing a game and was about to open a bag of popcorn for the feature movie to begin.  Will be uninstalling now.",
        "Forget the ads, the app is very annoying. Its is plagued with connectivity issues. Ads loads first (at the bottom) before your pending Scrabble games is updated...and that is IF the game lists updates without resulting in network error. Often, it will need repeated restarts to update the list or starting a new random online game to force it.  I cannot recommend this app to first timers because it is frustrating. The Scrabble game cannot be enjoyed as EVERYTHING must be online...even Solo play. Look elsewhere until issues are addressed."
