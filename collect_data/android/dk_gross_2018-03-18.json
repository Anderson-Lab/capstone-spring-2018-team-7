        "No point in being able to have a ton of ppl on your friends list if you can't send more then 5 gifts. Should be able to at least send to all. 148 floors before u can rebirth? Too much a pain in the ass when you get stuck on a floor cause you can't beat the boss with current gear but you need to advance to get better gear.",
        "Wow.. I though it an RPG game.. Well ur role is to create an account and that's it... All auto, game play (if any) is rushed..no time to savor the game.. what so ever.. U keep getting full bags.. When u try organizing, it full again in before u finish...and much more.. In my opinion.. It's not a really a game..  well just money sucker maybe.. (Just my opinion).",
        "Picked this game up because it looked kind of like Nonstop Knight, and I liked Nonstop Knight. Unfortunately, it's not LIKE Nonstop Knight, it IS Nonstop Knight. It's a lazy reskin of the same game with more micro transactions bolted on.  Don't waste your time. Nonstop Knight is more fun and it won't do everything in its power to drain your bank account.",
        "Stay away from this game all it does is rollback after you do stuff in game it's so great to get to lvl50 3 days in row to just be knocked back to lvl47 3 plus times a day.  They steal items gained, don't bother to reset attempts, just waste of time.",
        "The gms in this game care nothing for their players. There was a \"rollback\" bug that liked to remember everything you spent, but not any of the rewards or achievements you recieved. After losing over 4k gems, multiple pieces of advanced gear, a very rare talent, countless forge points, and even a rare pet, they decide to give everyone 1000 gems as a \"shut up, take this even though we know you lost so much, but we aren't doing anything else to keep our players\" as a reply pretty much.  The game it's way to buggy and full of support that just doesn't care about their players are all. I would never suggest playing this game to anyone.",
        "As promised here's my edit. The latest update seemed to resolve the issue, at least for me. Although I see in chat others are still having the issue so hopefully this will get resolved for good. Thank you for your speedy service."

        "It's unfair when your coins got stolen when you are online, the moment I wanted to upgrade my coins are all suddenly gone, this is frustrating! I'm okay with pigggbank because I can see player's online around my board, atleast I can prepare myself, but NO, it's just suddenly gone like that, not cool! And it even took 80-90% of your savings, much wow...",
        "Fun game, but can get very frustrating cause Peeps steal your stuff before you can upgrade cause you ran out of rolls, which makes you want to spend money, 4 rolls an hour is a bit crazy, but I guess it works in making you want to spend money. It's free to play but it'll be difficult. But the game is fun when things are going right",
        "I emailed support and they have yet to get back to me. Trying to get idols to get the special dice and every box is repetitive even when I use gems to open gold box for rare ones, it's always repetitive. When you offer suggestions as they request for better game play they brush it off and just say that the problem you are having is part of the game. Why ask for suggestions when they are not listened to. Very disappointed in support, been a long time player since it came out. They seem to be all about making money now and could care less about their players.",
        "I only did one star to get y'alls attention. For some reason my game has started over, which sucks by the way, because I worked hard to get as far as I did. And when I start up the game, the only thing I can do is roll. I can't even log in or anything. Help!! 😭😭",
        "It's not a bad game, I would recommend that you turn OFF notifications because it will KEEP telling you that you have full rolls then when you open the game you only have 10. The figures never add up but it's fun from time to time.",
        "I love it! Play it when I wake up and before I go to sleep 😂 although they say the dice are random they clearly aren't, I know when there is 3 spaces to the police car I will roll a 3 and land on it.  Dice rolls need to regenerate faster tho"

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go."

You have to back out and start all over only to have it freeze again. Will probably delete it as it's now useless to try to play.",

        "I don't mind ads, but one after every round is excessive, especially when you can't skip them. Perhaps consider only ads you can't skip when requested, like for bonuses and prizes. I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",

        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?"

Also, why replace, billion, trillion, jillion etc. With numbers? At a glance it's much more confusing.",

        "I loved the game up until the date of this review. Too many new customizations require leaf tickets. Which translate into micro-transactions. I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Fun game, as the Score! Games usually are. Nice player system, solid multiplayer experience. But some changes need to be made: Tackling system needs revision. Need to be able to select tackler or cancel tackle. Far too much challenging from behind. Need to have tackle ready straight from kickoff, twice now I've conceded from kickoff because I had no tackle.  Players need to hold formation much better too. Higher levels with faster players easily get up the pitch in the break with no one around to defend.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update."

        "The game is amazing. Really addive, a lot to do including events, dungeons, pvps, afk hunting, auction houses and quests. But i have a couple of suggestions   1) Rather than making VIP players pay 10 dias to use their VIP duels, make it free. We did pay for our VIP or open that benefit at a specific tier.  2) Another VIP benefit that would be nice would be remote auction to shop and fight at the same time lol  Other than that, just fix trade and get rid of the 30 min auction upload lol the game is awesome even without those things.",
        "It's not as pay to win as everyone is saying, yes it's quicker but with normal grinding and combining of lower items you can easily get anything. Vip points are earned in game and don't need to be bought also. Yes the auto quest and kill makes it easy but it's for minimal gameplay later on as you must actually control and move correctly to clear harder content and bosses. It's not like the pc version of it but then again it's an app and I think they did great.",
        "Good game in general . solid contains. looking forward to Rappelz the rift :D when can we expect an early access? Btw for the gender limitation u can probably take exemple from other mmorpg here in the store like OAC or Crusaders of lights as exemple but many can have gender and more customize and classes. Hope to see more in the future but Great Game . keep the hard work 😉",
        "Used to play the original on pc over like ten years ago and loved it. I saw the game in app store and downloaded straight away. Amazing little gane. It is a proper time killer and very easy to get stuck into and understand. It's just a shame there is no shops you can buy equipment from with the soulbound Penya.",
        "Awesome game. But it's just that I really didn't felt it enjoyable I mean I am a Hardcore MMORPG player but this game just didn't felt right. Maybe because i didn't even did much but crossed level 80+ and I didn't have to use my brain on it and didn't did much and got everything easily. Or maybe I'm more into SAOIF type gamer. I don't know. That's why 4star.",
        "Its an ok game but doesn't compare to the real game itself. I'm disappointed with the controls. I have to use the joystick to move around or auto, and it doesn't respond well. It could use some work but not bad. But I did get bored in just 2 days."

What is so sad is the developers allowed this to come about so now the game is basically dead. All the daily activities that can make you stronger are taken by this 10 or 12 players who play muiltble accounts so don't play this game or at least don't spend your money on it",

        "game.. but has many problems to fix To many players useing dp 24/7 ..vip players pay $$$$  and get very little for a large purchase..   mobil strike is much cheaper and give you alot for just a small purchase of $99.... and more fun..",
        "Shame on you Anders Moller Faggard. Youre a disgrace to GB community. Ricky Yang,  wake up and stop being greedy. Google, pay attention as you already recieved many complaints about  the developer of this game. To the newbie dont waste your hard earned money or you will regret it."

        "In my opinion this game is fun to play, great graphics and other stuff, but what has to do with food and other things reset time is taking too much time. I think games like this ant alike are not worth playing unless you willing to spend real money to fasten leveling your heroes or you don't mind playing few years just to reach max level.",
        "Very good game I'm hooked already.  Spent money don't get when you receive your monthly card other wise bad ass game. I will support this game any day.",

        "Got to the stage where the in game tutorial tells me to go to the portal and do the trial. I pick the first 2 heroes it tells me to pick then it tells me to pick the power rating. Can't do anything after that. Have to force shut the game... Was enjoying it up to that point."

        "Love this game, I wish there were more like it but the only other one I've found is Zombie Castaway. I like the fact that Klondike uses power to clear items as opposed to tools in ZC. Also, Klondike has many other activities to do which do not require energy, this is a really great game. My favorite so far.",
        "Great game.  Since the last update your energy doesn't replenish as fast as it use to.  The energy requirements are greater than you earn.  Slowed down my playing the game for sure.",
        "This game is my kind of gamè it keep me going love it wonderful to  play   thank .",
        "The only 2 things I don't like is that players can't interact with other players nor visit other people's farms, and when you're filling Mr. Chaney's orders, you only receive 1 or 2 items like 1 trowel. Can't get very far in your game if you only receive very few items. I think Klondike should allow other players to interact with eachother, to help get more items faster.",
        "I started playing about 6 weeks ago and really enjoy the game. I wish there was more information available about gameplay. I did get a quick reply from help when I first started but the group page is not very helpful at all. A guide for beginners would be a great help and ease players into the game.  Edited after update: agree with so many others that the changes such as overheating and no energy buffs from gold animal statues are not changes I like. The game was enjoyable before but these changes make it even more difficult to get much done.",
        "I really like this game. I have been playing it for awhile now. The only thing I wish is that we could add friends & go to their land to do work on it to gain energy, coin & gems. Will we be seeing more islands when we reach the last island? Why did you change the energy machine? I liked it the way it was before. Why did you change the fire pit? Now I have to wait to make anything with fire. That sucks."

And also, pls add some advance tactics like 'Tiki-taka', 'gegenpress', 'false nine', etc just like what you guys did in PC/PS PES 2018",
        "I want to make comments what happened with my team if i compared with other team: 1. The passing is worst, my opponent is batter then mind 2. My players seem not to jump to challenge the opponent if the ball on the air 3. The development of the players are taking time..until 30 of age they only reach 90..its to late",

        "A great game now ruined. Constantly closing after or during a match and sometimes not even starting again. My Asus Z500m should handle it with ease yet I find myself frustrated with problematic behaviour from the game. Fix this. I've been sending feedback for months and nothing has been fixed.",
        "Who made that script, for mobile games it has been the most exciting sports game. I must say it is very complicated specially in the starting but you get addicted to it just for its complications but love to be a manager.. Well done not easy to create such a difficult so deep kind of script.",
        "Let me start by saying awesome game, great graphics playing on and off for years but what's is going on with this game play. Defenders literally running by ball carrier, ridiculous passes by my team and missing clear scoring opportunities. Slowness of my team, no attacking effort, no tackling effort, keeper not even stopping a single shot. Guess I need to just stop playing again. Overall good game just work on the gameplay and AI decision. Uninstalling."

        "Lolz.  I loves it.  Features and content are definately revolutionary from the first oac. Erm.... Trading cards,  hellz yeah!! Companions/ mounts features(like most of everything in this game) needs research, and looking into,  but most def a worthy investment. Having complications with the game? Uninstall, re-install,  restart,  search an oac blog spot,  get creative and learn your game as if you were trying to learn your characters skill,  the game is freaking s!(|{!! I give it a 4 never the less,(wich is most likely due to my service provider) due to complications ive yet to resolve.",
        "First, the game won't connect to my wifi so it wanted me to use my data.. Fine whatever. I download it all and as soon as I start, it asks me to talk to a flame knight healer, whenever i hit the bottom right dialogue button or select him/icon he just says 'flame knight to me!' over and over. After hearing this 50 times I'm uninstalling.",
        "Lost my progress in the game and customer care doesn't even bother to reply back. The developers don't even have the sense to sync the game with google play games. I can't even choose my old server. Don't play this game unless you want these people to steal your money and time. The second you reset your phone, it's all gone.",
        "If you are into mmo's then this game is perfect for you. There is stuff that costs cash but you don't need it to play I've played for over a year and haven't paid a dime. Great graphics and controls. A couple bugs but with such a big game it's bound to happen. Perfect for fans of wow or eso",
        "Guys you need to be a bit more lenient about the vigor. I got to level 15 and the vigor wall hits me. I'm new to your game and loving it so far. Just 1 major problem vigor runs out in 1 hour. I can't grind for the festive wings because no vigor. I understand you want money from people but the vigor is not the way. . Add mounts to buy and wings to buy add more cool vanitys to buy instead. If I could buy a flying mount straight up for 20 dollars I would. Or wings for 10 dollars I would. Please fix the vigor.",
        "Truely entertaining. There is a lot to do, and the storyline is engaging. The graphics are incredible without being too showy; in a lot of RPG type mobile games, I find it easy to loose track of my character because I'm distracted by the bright lights and excessive animations of skill attacks. This is often exacerbated by the sheer mass of other characters in an area. I have not had this problem while playing this game; other characters are nicely space and easy to ignore. Also; as a female playing a female character, I apprecitate the lack of obligate bikini armour."

        "Love it! Sure, it has auto battle and auto guide for missions, but it can be turned off if you are really picky about that. It has much more choices in class, and highly customizable.   There is a bunch of other awesome features that you don't even need to spend money on, so I myself would recommend this game to those who like this sort of thing!   Thanks developers, you're awesome!",
        "Servers seem to be stabilizing so I'm going to change my 1 star review to 3. This game would have been great if they used the same graphics as the story. In this day and age developers have made huge leaps forward in the department and this game doesn't show it. Its jam packed with things to do, customization and other things. If they update the graphics this game would be the masterpiece that it needs to be!",
        "Doesn't seem to work on my mobile data? I don't have high-speed, but other MMORPGs work perfectly fine on average speed. I get the error message \"Server Connection Lost (0)-1\" or something every time I load it, and have yet to get farther than the loading screen (where the current event pop-up comes on, after the download loading screen.) I was really looking forward to playing. If I can get the app to work (going to try online tomorrow!), I'll happily change my review! I'd really like this to work on my data, though; I don't have wifi at home.",
        "Fantastic game it takes some time to get used to the camera angles (It would be even better if you could rotate the camera around your character, it improves the atmosphere). Combat is ... Well it takes time to get used to that too that could use some improvements. Character design is good I like it Story is good also (Still progressing). Overall great game few small updates and changes will make it a even better game.",
        "Just as a personal opinion, a 60 fps option would be a good  initial long term patch to be working on. Also you need to realize the fan base your working with, I haven't played the pc version but it looks like some of your fans transitioning from pc top mobile aren't very happy.  Also the mobile rpg type game fans are pretty hard to please initially, we've probably been through tons of other games with the same approach as you. Other than that I would think about how to polish the game up a bit more, maybe look at other games and see what elements make them look polished verses your own game?",
        "I played this game religiously on PC, beat the main story. Hit Max level, made a massive guild. And also spent 100s of dollars on skins and rubies. I have 2 questions, 1) can we link our oc accounts 2) why isn't there a skin color change option on mobile?"

Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",

        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics",
        "What is the problem with this app? In one of your levels you say that I have to hit a goal in 6 kicks or fewer and I have to assist with my hero,when I try doing it, you just make angles that make me pass in the opposite direction and my hero is in the defence and after 1 pass my hero just remains in the defence and that's  why I do not have enough stars to unlock the next season and there are a lot of problems in the other levels also.Please improve it or give me a free season unlock or give me some free stars for every season"

        "Really entertaining story. Great tactics gameplay and characters. I enjoyed this much more than I expected. Steve Jobs said, good artists borrow but great artists steal and I feel that that is what this game did. Very heavy Naruto vibe with Logi and Dias. Then of course,  the Full Metal Alchemist feel with alchemy and the door of truth and leaving part of your body on the other side of the door in order to gain power. 7 kingdoms, 7 deadly sins. This had a good animated opening and song. This game has been very entertaining and I'm looking forward to the next episode to see what happens next. Good stuff, Gumi.",
        "Quite unique game with active players who already experienced the japanese version. UI needs lots of improvements, my goodness! Like Units page must have a back button, and be available not only when going back from Home (Talk abt inconvenience). Loot pieces on-hand should be available when newly acquired loots are pressed and hold! Screen transition also needs optimization for faster reaction.",
        "So far I have only been playing the game for a few hrs. The graphics are sharp and the controls are easy to learn. My only complaint is you can't turn the camera a complete 360 to get a better look at where you opponents are. Other than that it's a great game. Closest thing to Final Fantasy Tactics on Android. Love it.",
        "Best Turn based tactic game. You dont need to be a whale to be good bcos of10% \"rainbow\" summon chance. The stage and event is quite challenging. The only problem is MULTIPLAY. Please make the player can switch between private (code) room to public so that if we only wait for 1 friend, we can switch to public to fill the other 2 slots. It is because if we go to public there is a high chance our friend cannot enter our room bcos of full slots. And then force us to disband and recreate room over and over just to make our friend enter our room.",
        "Game is SUPERB, however it will be awesome if devs could implement following suggestion 1. Quest mission pop up is super annoying if we want to manually farm the equipment in the story mission. 2. Try again mission should be automatically enter the dungeon instead of choosing the team formation. 3. Auto go option, so player can easily farm the dungeon.",
        "Great VAs and story. What I mostly disliked is how slow the combat is even with the accelerated mode, to grind materials it can be quite annoying if you lack skip tickets. I hope they add an option to skip combat animation soon."

Sure there is a point where there is a wall, but at least you know your one of the strongest. Plus it makes me want to climb that wall, and topple whales.",
        "Maybe one of the best games that still let you play to win. You can get everything with enough patience and a little luck. If you do want to pay though, it's gonna be pretty expensive and the stuff you get does not really let you advance a lot (unless you actually spend A LOT of money).",
        "+ Easy to play + Good story line + Also easy to get the items + I like the game mechanic  - Need more challenging on battle - Need table of hero type - Inventory items don't include the gear being use  Overall i like this game, very good. Also, more hero will make this game more good. And... adding charge chain attack will be awesome  Edit: After update my account was lost, please fix it",
        "This game is great. It doesnt beat you over the head with paywalls, you could probably play f2p and still have a ton of fun. Graphics are good and mechanics are deep and satisfying. Only complaint is the reddit coommunity, but cant blame the devs for that.",
        "Previous rating was 👍👍. Now 👍.  Content drought at the end of the game with some very expensive in app purchases. End game is killing the same dragon or farming the same level over and over and over...there are daily tasks which are a chore. Hoping for quality of life improvements similar to what the reddit suggests.   I really like the art style.",
        "Great game with the most responsive and generous developers.  The only thing bad about this game is the toxic gaming community.  Full of unjustifiable whiners who are so poor they need their freebies for EVERY event or else they have a hissy fit and threaten to quit game AND also cry koz of nerfs on their heroes and threaten to quit(but really don't). They also attack every person who does spend for the game (casual spender or whale) God-forbid the devs need to also earn for a living."

        "Used to be one of the best time management games available but they no longer fix the glitches.  There hasn't been any updates or new venues for a long time so think the game is being phased out. The game is free but you do need to buy gold with hard cash to progress. No longer worth downloading, my advice is to find something else to play.",
        "It is an awesome game. It is very addictive and I feel very invested in it. If you don't want to spend any of your real money to buy gold, you sure don't need to. It takes a hell lot more to get everything you want but it's still playable. It has some bugs, sure, specially regarding your wireless connecting but it's nothing major. The levels are really hard sometimes but makes up for the good challenge. Thanks, devs, for the awesome game",
        "I love this game. I play it almost everyday. The only thing I don't like is when you spend your supplies to play even when you win you still lose those supplies to play instead of keeping your supplies so you can continue to play on. Other then that. It's amazing. So download this app and have some fun today, tomorrow, or whenever you have some past time. Thanks Chef Ramsay.",
        "I love the game. But there's some bug issues like   1) login to claim 10golds - didn't happen. Where'd the gold? 2) now I can't even login to social. It keep loading, then kinda leave it at that.   I would rate it 5 stars once this is resolved. It's really getting on my nerves.",
        "Game could be cool but has way too much stuff crammed into the tiny screen of most phones. Graphics need to be simplified so that you can see things easier. Overall, the game freezes and crashes every time I try to play. Spend more time making this game stable and easy to see and it might be more fun.",
        "Up until five days ago I wasn't having any problems with this game and I played it nearly everyday. Now I can open the app but nothing happens when I click on any part of the game. This has kept me from being able to do anything with the game for nearly a week. I've missed out on events and opportunities to move up on leaderboards. Please fix the app. I enjoy the game and I don't want to lose progress because of a technical error."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ❤👏👏",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player's data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player's stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player"

        "Great gameIncredible game. But when you move up in lvls the cost of every detail is ludacris! I've played this game a month and spent good money on it.  I am not into waiting a half a day so I can gain a 5 min advantage, then turn around and do it again. Only this time, just wait longer! .... Or of course you could just spend be re $.... Awesome game... makers are greedy!",
        "I'm not happy that I can only send 20 gold from my accounts to one of my accounts per day. I'd like to send more gold per day. Annoying 2 alliance war battle limit should be gotten rid of. It's annoying, expensive and takes a very long time to reach each level of the game. Overall, it's a good game to play but it can be improved",
        "The last few days this game become completely useless and unplayable. The matchmaking has been tweaked to the point where I'm being attacked by significantly higher players, without even a possibility to retaliate! At the same time when I try to attack in quick match, the level of my opponents is being so high, that I have zero chances winning a simple attack.  I'm thinking about uninstalling this game permanently. When contacted, Zynga employee suggests to spend more money to upgrade my defenses. How is that for \"humanly friendly\" customer service? Horrible service.",
        "After getting to HQ level 10 it just got so boring.  To be honest don't like the game play playing against other people either.  The play is slanted toward the attacker .  Deleted",
        "It's quite unreasonable that the nuke is too close to other command items! So, please give me back a nuke, and 40000 fuels as well as 5000 metals for reviving robot and retraining tanks! Also put the nuke to other corners!",
        "Game has a fun, friendly community of players. Load times kinda slow. Occational bugs and glitches. Usually following after updates. Overall though a fun game that has new features added frequently, keeping it interesting."

The older version did this as well, but not nearly as badly. The frequency that it shuts down is ridiculous. If it wasn't for that I'd have given it a perfect score.",
        "Lowered rating to 3 from 5 because this resource hog now has over 1 GB of data on my phone! Still an awesome distractor when your brain needs a break.",
        "Sorry for the 1 star, Wooga but could you please, tone down the levels of difficulty (It's too difficult) and I promise you, I will give you a 5-Star rating once you have changed that?  From Muhammad Faezin (2 Years of playing Jelly Splash since 2016 and 2015 & I'm now in Level 260)",
        "I am enjoying this game. The characters are cute. I enjoy a game that has sweet characters and not ugly evil characters that would give me nightmares. Keep up the good work Wooga Team.",
        "I love this game. So addicting. I cannot stop playing it. Each level has its own challenge.",
        "Very unresponsive, turns off mid game. Seriously thinking I should not bother with it. Very slow."

        "Clash of clan pak 11 from 250 up to 5150... How the hell? Our clan tried and still we received nothing. I was way over the 500 points to get the legendary pack but no I don't get it. Your replies seem to be automated with certain words triggering certain responses. Sort your stuff out people, get your house in order and give us what we deserve. Our legendary bonnet head. I will be uninstalling if you don't come around",
        "Fun game. Good graphics, and overall good fishing simulator. However, its ridiculously rigged. I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",
        "OUT OF ALL THE FISHING GAMES THAT ARE ON THE APP STORE I'VE FOUND ONLY 3 WORTH PLAYING,AND THIS MY FRIENDS IS ONE OF THEM!!!!!!! IT'S A MUST DOWNLOAD AND TRY FISHING GAME/APP!! GREAT GRAPHICS, AND DESIGN!!! IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS FISHING GAME/APP THEN YOU ARE MISSY OUT ON A FANTASTIC DAY OF FISHING!!!!  SO STOP READING AND GET TO DOWNLOADING THIS APP, AND GET TO ALL THE INCREASABLE FISHING FUN!!!!!!😎😋🤣😄😅😁😂🤗😜😛😌😳😱😰",
        "This game is so AWESOME! This game will also teach you alot about the fish you are catching. Great time killer. Just becareful you'll kill to much time. LOL I just realized it's 2:04am. I have to be at work at 6:00am. Download this game now! Thank you for making an AMAZING fishing game. Hats off to the creater's",
        "This game is great and what it does, massive castles sprawling battles across the ages with wizards on dragons back firing missiles at unicorns below... Erm it's fishing they lured me in and I'm hooked, what else is there to say. Great game.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

        "This is a great game. It's fun, addictive, and a great time killer. The only problem I see is that I created an account on the game thinking it would save. WRONG! I had to do a factory reset on my phone and now I have to start over. I was so far with some really good cards, but alas I know more about the game now, so maybe I'll get there quicker this time.",
        "Don't bother downloading this game.  The customer service in this game is terrible.  I submitted a ticket because several combinations i researched in game disappeared.  I got a response that the game would fix itself and my ticket was being closed.  The problem didn't fix itself and i can't remember every combo lost. I submitted another ticket and I'm waiting for a response but after how my first ticket was handled I'm not confident they'll fix it. I've only been playing a few days but if the game is this buggy already then i don't recommend downloading it.",
        "It's actually surprisingly fun. The card mechanics are simple to grasp but with a enough depth to keep you trying new decks and combos. I chuckled a few times at some of the dialouge between the characters. 10/10 would recommend",
        "The game is addictive, but in short it's a gamble for cards. The prices are a lot for what you are getting. Lots of repetitive challenges. Unfortunately the quest for cards is really a quest for your wallet. I played since 9/16 and decided to walk away. Unfortunately you get to a point where the only way to move up is to spend, spend, spend. The gambling pulls for cards on real money game currency got old.",
        "The main problem with the game in my opinion is being able to attack your opponent while they have other cards in play. Perhaps if you could choose to block rather than be forced to take it the game would be a bit better aa youd have to manage your resources a bit better rather than beat hard until its over. Aside from that it is a very fun game to play",
        "Waste of money. No matter what you spend you never get decent cards. They stack the odds so no matter how you buy cards you'll always get ripped off. Mom's box is supposedly random yet I've bought hundreds of boxes I've never got anything worth a damn. I've played over a year and wasted a hundred bucks on this game w no reward. I strongly recommend you don't spend a dollar on this game. It won't help. The game will still screw you. Money will not help on this game."

And support like i said is terrible do not waste your time or money downloading this! You will only be disappointed in the end.",
        "After playing for 10 months straight every day, still come back, even though everything is done very slow by that advanced level of the base, therefore it's addictive. A sci-fi setting in a familiar and loved universe helps, of course.  Just need to be able to send to other players various items, boosts, and shields, not only resources, that would make it much more interesting at this point!",
        "I would rate the game higher but it needs major work. The wait times for smaller troop tiers and beginning research is horrible. Makes the game boring.  I am waiting to see if I continue to play it. Depends if anything changes. To research for tier 2 infantry takes over a day. At this current time this is a very pay to play game as you would want speedups. This is odd for Plarium. I enjoy their other games. This one needs vast improvement and fast if they want to keep people around. As well the game is in desperate need of an in game translator!!!",
        "I really love this game. Easy controls. Yes, it takes a little longer to upgrade various parts of the base as you level up. I encountered the first war. WOW!But, One thing, please tell to upgrade this Draedulus-12 leader. He is at level 23, 3%. He still look the same. OVERALL-AWESOME.!!!",
        "I loved this game initially but one massive problem I have experience is the chat box within your leagues forum. It is massively glitched and when you type or try to delete one word then ten new ones randomly come on screen. This makes chatting to your team mates almost impossible. I asked plarium many times to fix this but they keep ignoring. You want a game where you can chat with ease with your team mates",
        "I m playing this game for long time and i liked this game but now this game asking too much .So many back to back events .I think the game maker must know that all playing this game have a real life to deal with.Reduce back to back events.I m sure if u guys dont do it most players will quit and this game will be longer played."

    "descriptionHTML" : "Terminator Genisys: Future War is a free-to-play mobile strategy game where the human Resistance is locked in a never-ending war with the machine army. Genisys is destroyed and Skynet is offline, but the future war is far from over. Engage in large-scale strategic warfare and rejoin the struggle between machine and man. Build your base, attack your enemies and pave the way to victory for your clan in tactical multiplayer.<br><br>Plarium, developer of the hit titles Vikings: War of Clans and Throne: Kingdom at War, has created a deep strategy MMO in the Terminator universe. Set directly after the events of the film, Terminator Genisys: Future War offers players a chance to reset the future with addictive gameplay, constant action, and massive clan warfare.<br><br>With two different playable factions, you can choose to take the role of a Resistance Commander or the leader of Skynet&#x2019;s Core, and either save the last of humanity or crush it under your cybernetic heel.<br><br>John Connor is MIA, and the Resistance is broken. As a human commander, it is up to you to rebuild humanity&#x2019;s most determined military force, find and recruit survivors to your cause, and stop the machines from reactivating Skynet. Or you can betray humanity and convert yourself to join the machine regiments.<br><br>Would you rather play as an unstoppable killing machine? With Skynet&#x2019;s primary core offline, your secondary protocols are clear. Construct factories, find lost battle schematics and terminate the human threat once and for all. If you feel sympathetic to the human cause, you can decide to reprogram yourself and fight alongside the Resistance.<br><br>Both sides are fighting for their lives and defeat is not an option. Arm yourself with futuristic tanks, relentless infantry and devastating weapons - and win the future war once and for all!<br><br>NOTE: Terminator Genisys: Future War is completely free to play, but some in-game items can be purchased for real money. You can switch off the in-game purchase option in device settings. You need an Internet connection to play this game.<br><br>GAME FEATURES<br><br>- FREE TO PLAY!<br>- Two playable factions, each with its own narrative, troops, buildings and upgrades!<br>- Intense PvP!

        "Awesome game if u love strategy & buissness tactics with football......plz upgrade the game play in exhibition or others game play into 3d & give a weekly basis youth squad facility....fans need it...& love it",
        "Surprisingly deep experience. I suppose the obvious comparison would be to Soccer Spirits. This is a lot more grounded in reality (there's a lot less talking rabbits and little girls who can do magic), but there's more to do. There's also a dry cleverness permeating everything.  UPDATE: I've hit a weird and frustrating wall--the game isn't clear about when its days roll over. I guess it might be UTC (there are several indications that the game originates in the UK), but for a few days, my daily quests were rolling over at midnight Pacific Time (like most of these games that punish players for not playing every day), but today I noticed that there doesn't seem to be ANY consistency regarding when daily quests begin and end. Anyway, I'm docking two stars (I otherwise believe that this is a five-star game) until the game's daily rollover time is clarified. I had a nice streak going, that the game's failure to communicate ruined.",
        "Love this game, loads to do, plenty to keep you interested.",

Why change something that wasn't broken!! 😡  UPDATE...since the second update the game is back and I LOVE it. Thank you so much for sorting it out. I genuinely love this game!!",

Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",
        "The problem is the friends system requires you connect via Facebook. For people that don't want to, or don't have Facebook, you're screwed. Please implement a way to add friends inside the game rather than through Facebook harassment.",
        "The game has the potential to be very entertaining however the constant crashes and app failure is very disheartening. Definite work needed to improve these issues, now its saying the app may not be optimized for the device. Why wouldn't it say that before downloading? Try again!",
        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

        "Fun and easy to pick up and learn quickly. The game has nice effects and a huge variety of characters to play an upgrade. Love the auto play button for when I'm doing something around my apartment. I can still play it but not having to keep my eye on it too much. Music and voices can get sort of annoying but that's what a volume button is for right?",
        "One of the better rpg strategy games out. There's a ton of things available to do if you run out of stamina. The main currency is diamonds which you can purchase but surprisingly they are not that difficult to acquire in game.  Overall I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed games like Fate grand order, syd story and dokkan battle.",
        "Its kinda good, not my favorite but still pretty good. Also, J hate that you took Sayori from Doki Doki Literature Club just so you can have it in your commercial. Talk about copy right.",
        "Game is fun. I like the arts of character, well designed but some new arts like Cynthia looks really weird. End game seems alot of harder, and lately requires alot of luck or money to get stuff like skins etc. Still a great game, been playing for over 1 year.",
        "I used to love this game before a few months ago and was having a blast just playing hours on end until the next daily mission. But ever since the update, servers are terribly slow, game always forces out from time to time. Even despite that internet is at a excellent proximity range, the servers are just terrible for some reason which is sad since as an experienced player who been playing and supporting this for over 1 year, it feels as if it's getting worse and worse with each new update",
        "This game has not fixed the commercial issue. Still illegal. Plus the loading screen is taking forever and it seems they did not like my last review so they deleted it."

        "This is a very convenient app. All of my favorite stories are in one place. Just one issue only, I want to transfer my data to a new device & I am having trouble doing so. I have managed to successfully transfer all my old data to this new app before, but I would like to transfer my new & existing data to another device. I have registered & followed all of the instructions to the tee on the transfer form & it always says \"could not transfer data\" . Also there is no fill space on the form that prompts to fill in  'Support ID'. I hope this gets looked into.",
        "I find this app very convenient and like it a lot. But there are a few small bugs(eg. BMP's scene transition fx) and if possible, I hope the data on device can be stored in the SD card as it's taking up quite a lot of space. Thank you very much for the hard work and improving the app all the time, Voltage. ^^",
        "I have no problem anything except the roulette. I hope Voltage will change the value of coins from 5 to 10(bronze), 10 to 50 (silver) and 100 (gold) remains the same.  It requires unfathomable patience for how many days just to get the whole story. One chapter for 100 coins, I'm fine with it if it has only 5 chapters but aside from too many chapters it has also separated sequels and epilogues. *cries*  Please reconsider changing the amount of coins. Hopes for better system and greater stories.",
        "Loved it,even though at the beginning,i 'm a bit skeptical about it, it is kinda efficient in some way.but i do miss the standlone apps.also the login bonus is quite dissapointing,like we only get 5-10? At least give us a bit of generous amount like 10-20 coins",
        "For anyone looking for an MC who isn't a pushover, try the newer stories. Our Private Homeroom stands out as unusually well-localized, to the point it feels like someone studied the English speaking hemisphere of the Internet for modern slang. I very much appreciate the upgrade in sass and backbone, so it was pretty well done nonetheless. I've been a monthly subscriber for months with no intention to change this.",
        "Prices aren't competitive with paperback books. Why spend $4 per chapter when I can buy a 400 paged book new for $8. Also, the daily login bonus gives 5-10 coins per day; it would take months to unlock a single chapter at that rate. The only thing thia app has going for it is the free story every 2 weeks. 🙏🙏🙏 I suggest making this work more like Voltage's Lovestruck app & also letting us watch adds in exchange for coins."

        "The match making system could be improved. Match making is based on your level but does not take into account the level of the ship. To test this I took a Heavy Fighter At level 11 and was being matched up with Frigates. No chance in heck to win for me. Even at higher levels it's hard to win if your opponent has a ship 3-4 steps above you. A limit of 2 levels above and below for ships would be a good fix.",
        "A truly enjoyable game with a few simple strategies that somewhat take the fun away.   For instance, warp drives have a big chance of putting you behind the other guy where your thrusters and generators usually are(it's more or less game over if they get destroyed). If you go for a laser heavy they'll have no way of defending since they can't put armor and thrusters and shields don't block lasers.   Also you can't name your ship which is a bit of a missed opportunity",
        "I also liked the game more at lower levels. Maybe you could make it like a loss drops your rating by so many points. I hit lvl 130 and barely win a fight with either of the three of my ships. If we could drop points, maybe we could get 3 straight wins or 5 a day. The higher the rank, obviously means harder opponents. But my ships are only so strong while saving up money to by better upgrades or a better ship. Please fix this",
        "Great game, really fun gameplay. The feature of being able to earn up to ~50 celestium (in game paid currency) by playing the game and doing daily achievements is really good. Only gripe is that there is no confirmation button for spending celestium leading to accidently spending it at a miss-tap and no way to undo these purchases. Other than that very good.",
        "This game if fun....but after trying a couple of the free offers to gain in game currency and never receiving the funds I will be uninstalling. I contacted fyber(the ad company that gives out the currency) and they say they gave the compensation. I cannot support a game that blatantly states that funds may not be awarded and still uses the fraud company. It is a great disservice to the player base and I will not stand for it",
        "Fun concept and decently executed. So much so players don't see the pay to win till you get to level 10 ( the black market is locked till then). The items inside the black market take cash currency in large quantities. And even though you can earn the cash currency, the amount is petty and will take forever to stack up.  Though I can't see people popping in the large quantities of cash to be on top in this game, the possibility exists. Especially when most free to play games have players who are in house ( employees and other sources) and get damn near unlimited in game currency to force the public to invest into the game to compete for top ratings and bragging rights..."

        "Updated This game has become about how much time and MONEY you can spend on it. They don't care about issues in game or what feed back they get. There are hundreds of issues that don't get addressed they just add more and more content hope people ignore the issues. Thed new content creates new issues and in some cases makes old issues worse",
        "Don't bother. Pay players only do well. And it's expensive! Devs have it programmed for pay players so you fall far behind and can't catch up. They match you against pay players that are always stronger. Contests are extremely difficult. Been playing for 2 years so I know what I'm commenting about.",
        "Ever since the new owners took over, content has lessened. Although new heroes appear, it is all about money scams and contests. Turned down drop rates make it nearly impossible to upgrade with dropping piles of cash.",
        "Used to be a fun game with silly characters and lots to do. Since sold by per blue game quality has plummeted. Deleted and moved on to other games that run smoother and appreciate customer feedback.",
        "The text in game as become tiny almost unreadable since last update. Am I the only one? I'm playing on galaxy S8.",
        "One of my accounts was stolen, I had it connected to FB, Google & Email, I have gotten an email asking for things they need to verify, I sent what I could, name, server, etc, I also sent pics of the name it was when I had it and the name they changed it to, also the guild name, still not heard a thing back? It can't be that hard to get it back, I known a few ppl working in the gaming area, and they say it's pretty easy that you guys probably could care less, as long as you get your money...I really like playing it, I've put money into it, but security is horrible if I can have it connected to 3 things, yet someone can still steal it???.....Very disappointed now."

That said if u can get it to work it's a cute game with fun characters but not much in the way of gameplay.. click wait 3 hours click wait 2 hours click wait 4 hours and so on..",

So you take my money, then you don't let me play. Thanks Fox. Been months now and I can't even play. How you expect me to spend money when the damn game won't run for longer than a minute !",

Love going back levels to see if i can get the feather.   Coin packages need to be more attractive if you want people to spend real money and tbe power up packages are way too expensive. Still....... i love the game",
        "Well did love the game not now as it's taken me a long time to get off one level even brought more coins just to get. Only just now finished the last one I mean really come on now. Wat a joke  This why I've given a low rate",
        "I'm addicted to the game. The only problem is that you are not given power ups that you earn. I spend good money paying for power ups so, I would like to get the ones that I earn for finishing levels. Thanks.",

Y'all ripping us off with these tables because it said unlocked at level 19 then I go to buy the table it say unlock at level 22 SMH I'm on level 20 & I only got 10 tables... won't be spending no more money on this game!",
        "I love this game. I've been playing for a while now but the price of stuff is too expensive. I just barely made the money to get the Hawaiian barman and now his price went  from 60,000 to 81,000. This is too much. Please drop the prices down.                  Edit: thank you for the updates. I started over but everything is much better priced I love it!",
        "What could have been really fun turned out to be quite frustrating. I love this game but due to your policy of not providing sufficient tools for expansion makes me giving it only one star. Indirectly forcing gamers to pay for stuffs sucks real big time. I hope you will bring some changes to make it playable again for the gamers who dont want to buy gems.",

        "I find it a little tricky to navigate sometimes, since it makes my on-screen navigation bar disappear. I like it but maybe I would like it more if there was a back arrow? Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",
        "Really disappointed. I played the party game to win the St Patrick's badge. I came 2nd place when it finished and ift said I had won a badge but it doesn't appear in my badge collection. Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. 😟",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",

My wife bought \"180\"  twice thinking she may have made a mistake the first time and only ended up with about 300 total. She already had quite a few to begin with. Ripoff!"

        "Pay to win once you get to mid tier matchmaking. Fun still but some people de rank on purpose to fight people way below their character levels. Sometimes I get matched with people with 2 to 3 times my health and they also have more defense so it's as if they have even more plus can 2 shot me.",
        "It's not stable while playing, it says all the time network issue but, My net speed has 75 Mbps, still having problems while playing this superb game.  Graphics is good Controllers are best.  During phone calls , we lose the match haha usually.",
        "Good game  Except for the constant updates and also why when i use a breaker on someone(example i use laura shiba) and as she hits with her sword the strike move my opponent does still seems to overpower it..wheres the ethic in that? Lost many a battle due to this silly glitch..sort it out!! Once an attack has been made and is hitting the opponent regardless of priority moves it should still count!!",
        "Good graphics. I really wish you could sell rangers and monsters that you don't want. It is way too unorganized for me having all these warriors with flashing buttons saying UPGRADE, when I don't want to waste my coins and crystals on warriors I'm never gonna fight with.",
        "The controls are so bad and unresponsive that I routinely lose battles simply because it's not picking up my inputs. The gameplay is stupid from the fight mechanics to the stupid way you get characters. The game is made as a pay to win and that's just a terrible way to make a game. They keep saying performance enchanements in the updates and I'm just not seeing it. This game is purely a cash grab meant to take peoples money over nostalgia.",
        "Its to much of a gamble. For example i had a match were i started of with block, defense, block. And my opponent had from the looks a breaker, breaker, attack. I got freaking trashed in seconds. Thats the biggest issue for me and like some people leaders are f@#$*** ridiculously powerful. Needs more balance"

        "This game is awesome. The girls are beautiful and the songs are nice. There are a couple of errors I be having with the game though. I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won't get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved",
        "I like music game in general, it's hard to get the game right on mobile. but they manage to get it right here. The LP system prevent you to play continuesly unless you paid. But in my experience the amount is decent enough (this make you enjoy the music more since you dont have to restart to achieve perfection). The card mechanic is added bonus where you can spend hard earn cash. I can see people still enjoying the game without spending anything.",
        "Warning! This game is freakin' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging. The circle disappear sometimes during the live show. Sometimes the app even doesn't recognize my finger touch that makes me miss a circle. But overall. It's a good game  .... ALL HAIL PRINTEMPS AND GUILTY KISS",
        "I love the game definitely but with the new update, it keeps telling me that there's a transmission error then when it went through and finished connecting, it said that the data transfer was successful. I haven't transfered anything to a new device or anything like that. The only options I'm given is to contact support and start a new game in which I definitely don't want to do. It isn't my connection because everything else on my phone that requires WiFi is fine and I can use it. Is this because of the new update?",
        "I love the game and it's wonderful!!  But...  I had i don't know like a glitch or something.  When started to play the rhythm game while I playing suddenly the icon that I should press came faster all or a sudden. But the song is still OK.  After the glitch it becames back to normal.  This happen me for 3 times on the same day. Please fix it. And Thank you.",
        "It's so addicting and a fabulous rhythm game. One thing I'm really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don't do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don't know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls."

I tried to make it work for a day but it's super hard to earn money for upgrades. Even watching ads give so little rewards. Uninstalling. So unfortunate because i really loved the PC version of this.",

You complete the task, you are told you are getting $200 added to you bank account, BUT your $ total does not change.  This makes it hard to get money to spend.  All you can do is breed and sell fish - which takes time.  I reported this and got a prompt response that they are sorry and that they were adding $ and Gems  to my account balances.  Nice, but my $ total did not change.  I did see an increase in my gems.  There is an update 2/21/18 hopefully this will improve some issues.",
        "This app is good but need high battery consumption. I hope new upcoming update can reduce battery consumption. For everyone who complaint about money, just relax, breed your discovered expensive fish first and sell it till you have sufficient money. If you have much money you can discover more species freely in order to find magic fish. It's not about speed but it's about passion, strategy, trial error and patient.",

        "Had fun with my brothers after a long time. The games are simple (like those old 8 bit games) and funny. More games are expected. Devs should consider implementing some of the open source free games to make it more engaging. The free version is heavily limited where you'll be locked out for 30 seconds and 5 minutes for every 5mins and 30 mins respectively. In addition, only 2 players can join in the free version. It should be atleast 3 people for a real multi-player (as against dual-player), with ad supported. Premium is very inexpensive, though.",
        "We just spent the last few hours playing these games as a family. It was so much fun.  The kids did not wanna stop playing.    Edit:  After a week or so we are still enjoying AirConsole. It can be hard to get three teenagers to sit and enjoy family time, but this works everytime.  I really recommend this one!",
        "Originally had it at 5 stars. Now has wayy to many ads. Every 30 min makes you take a 5 min break (unless you buy the premium version or whatever). It does have SOME fun games to play with friends....  But It now makes you buy the Super version to play with more than 2 people. So if you want to play with more that 1 friend you have to pay for it. Dont get it",
        "Amazing!!! Being able to play games  on the go is exactly what you need!! A nintendo switch is useless if you have this! Me and my cousins really enjoyed this. However, the only thing I would really want is to view the game on your phone or device instead of on a TV or other things as if everyone who is playing has a nintendo switch and can see their character or whatever on it.   Thanks for reading I hope my idea will be implemented",
        "This is easily the best console I've ever used. Even if you have a slow internet connection, it still works with almost NO latency. Even the 30 second downtime is good, because it let's you get a quick drink of water. This is my new favorite app.",
        "I would overall give this game 4 stars cause it is very fun and i hope that this app gets very popular. The only problem is that some of the games have swearing and i want to play this with my family. So please make a family friendly section. That is why i rated 4 stars"

Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

        "Great for passing time, although at times you get kind of stuck where you can't gather any more materials because of storage capacity but then it takes forever to get the items for upgrade. The coin amount to buy some buildings is quite high on a lot of them, and the same with the trees and extra livestock. All in all I love playing this user friendly game!",
        "It has potential to be a great game. Its just so sloooow because you have to spend gems for almost everything. Its hard to get seeds because it's hard to get gems not everyone can afford to spend on these games. The land expansion sucks!!! It takes way to much, can't get what's needed half the time. Easier ways to get seeds and coins and it will be better.... Thanks!",
        "I enjoy this game. It's very addictive but in a good way. I actually just got my wife hooked on playing it as well.   My one question though, why are there so many differences between the Android system version and the IPhone system  version? On each building, my wife can see each item available and what level is needed to unlock it. That doesn't show on mine. Also, on hers, she has a fair/bazaar looking building, a delivery truck, and a hot air balloon thing.  Why are these not on the android version????",
        "Good game,  potential to be great I enjoy most of this game. To make it even better - more tools or the ability to buy them,  I have land I can't use because I can't clear it.  The ability to move trees,  grass, rocks until we are able to clear them, so we can make better use of our land. Better rewards  for completing collections,  I've gotten coins and 1 or 2 shovels.  Not good considering how long it takes to complete & that it says win up to 10 tools!?!  Better fishing,  I only catch catfish,  bass,  and anchovies.",
        "Half my images are invisible. I can't see half of my buildings or the items to craft, crafted items, items on sale or even my stand. I submitted a report to Storm 8 only to be told in a automated reply that they don't have the staff to handle it and there was nothing that would be done. I loved this game and had recently started over, looking forward to playing. Now, once I hit lvl 8, I'm uninstalling.",
        "Farm story 2 This game could be used and enjoyed more but at this time I am not playing as it is more frustrating them fun.  I need to expand the barn and silo but the things needed are a large amounts and RARE to achieve or even buy in the market.  Frustrated with trying to upgrade my barn so I will be taking a break for a while and will see if I return"

        "I think this app needs to be redesigned as a stand alone non-MMORPG that does not require any form of Sociopathetic Media. Cute design concept. Interesting plot. Clever programming. But I despise anything remotely like Social Media Community gatherings. If people want to meet get outside and go somewhere. The library, park, museum, etc.",
        "I usually download games and get rid of them because they aren't as good as they are made out to be. Also I get bored fast with games. Shards of Magic has been really fun and I play it often everyday when I have time! Nice to have a game that I don't get bored with. Oh! and you can buy gems, however, its easy to accumulate gems just playing! Have fun!",
        "Been a fan since Crystal Saga. Played Wartune when it first came out and participated in the open beta of Dragon pals. Played Crystal Saga 2, am lvl 82 on S1. Now I'm trying your mobile games. Keep up the good work, coming from one of your fans!",
        "Was a great game. But the pay to win has been pushed way way too far. The only way to play competitive anymore is to spend.. and spend big. I have always been happy to buy vip.. but the amounts of money you have to drop now to remain competitive is outrageous. Thanks for killing my favorite mobile app with greed r2.",
        "Game is buggy, you email support... bugs never get fixed.  They run gem promotions to give 30% bonus and it doesnt give any... fraudulent imo.  Dont waste your time.",
        "It's another one of those games that cranks numbers up so high to make us feel special. It's like seeing an item for 4.99. Wowee, it's less than 5! Play summoners war instead. Same concept, less pandering to fragile egos."

        "I've tried many TD so far still playing this one..every level in every map is unique..  its cool how I can pick and lvl Heroes but then it takes awhile to add a new one when running out of gems (since gems are needed for Heroes) unless u pay to keep playing or just to wait for tournaments... it takes patience lol but I don't mind playing again",
        "A great game with unique map designs and user friendly controls, free to play if you have patience and play strategically, pay to win if you want to advance faster. It is especially a good game for busy people like me who can only spend 10-15 minutes per day but need to stay in the game for a large number of days to be competitive. Don't try to use items and gems on every maps, it is fun and challenging to clear them without shortcuts. *Tip for developers*: Instead of giving purchase options for Sethos and Phoenix they could go with Yan and Narlax, gives chance for new players to compete also developers can milk in additional purchases.",
        "Great TD game with decent difficulty and NPCs progression while still maintining a pattern making you work to figure out various strategies.  Ads have never been an issue I honestly cant remember where they are.  I think they may only be for like \"double your rewards for battle\" kind of thing.  90% (A) or better in my oppinion.  Mainly cause I want to see more progression.  Note I am only a few levels in so I dont know if theres a pay to get by an immpassable place yet.",
        "*Updated* SCAM! Games slowly bleeds away your gems without mechanics being apparent. (I lost 300 gems in the last 3 days) Good luck unlocking heroes or content without paying $30-40. -2 stars.",
        "Your game is WAY too hard. I am at level 90+ and found the first 3 worlds great fun and balanced but now you have effectively destroyed the enjoyment factor by making the enemies SO strong that you cannot possibly beat them unless you have max level heroes...and the best max level heroes require so much to level up that without paying an absurd amount of real money you may aswell give up.you have broken what could have been the best game on android with selfish Pay 2 win tactics . Uninstalling after months of enjoyment and gameplay.  You need to fix this and make it challenging but not impossible",
        "It's really addicting, a lot of challenges and puzzles for the towers... really loved it! Good job team!   A bit of improvement: maybe an easier way to access the other worlds would be really good!?"

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks.",
        "This game will cheat you! I  upgraded a bunch of my characters but the next time I logged in nothing had saved! The funds I used to upgrade were also gone, of course. Don't waste money buying anything because the upgrades you make just disappear."

        "I enjoy this game. Almost forgot about the other games I'm playing. Little confused about some things still, but it's fun. That's the whole point. Right? Something fun to do while you wait,or all day because you have nothing else to do.",
        "After reaching level 15, I was supposed to be awarded points in a different app - DID NOT receive points even after submitting a support ticket. So it was a waste of time for me",
        "It takes to long to cook somethings it don't even take 6hrs to make cookies in real life. The strawberries 2 at a time an 17hrs to grow come on get serious. It's never other ways to get strawberries u have to buy the coin alot in order to get most things which wldnt be a big deal if u wld make things more practical like the time it takes to make food an grow fruit especially the strawberries. Two many ppl order stuff requiring strawberries so they sitting there 2 an 3 days for there order wld not happen in real life. Fix the time it takes to cook an grow food.",
        "Its a good game sorry far I'm only level 11 but the gameplay is good. Only thing I would have to complain about is the lack of excitement in the food yeah it's different but to much stuff to get with so little goodies",
        "A good game, however it would be better if you could earn cash more easily and quickly rather than having to spend real money constantly, it will put me off eventually",
        "So you want to be a chef? Well you picked the wrong game. Might want to try either World Chef or Country Cooking. Either one is better then this piece of garbage. REPLY 3-2-2018 The afore mentioned games don't have any ads (except watch a video). Therefore they are way better in that aspect alone. Get rid of the ads and I'll give more stars. A \"classy 5 star restaurant\" doesn't need ads. So that makes me think this game has NO class or programmers are greedy or both. REPLY 3-5-2018 I did contact in game support and they basically  said: \"So sad, to bad, we don't care.\" So again that makes me think the makers of this piece of trash are just  a bunch of greedy people. If you respond to this quit giving me canned responses.."

Although after this gargantuan update it seems to be really laggy and I experience frame rate issues almost all the time making enjoyable and smooth gameplay impossible. This is especially annoying since I am playing on an s8 +",

Somehow whenever I started the game three second ads will be popping up. I hope that the ads will show up at other times, not when the game started. I'll be thankful if this problem could be fixed. Liked the game very much though.",

If Finn and Jake (from adventure time) Were real they would totally rate this a 5 Star rating! New penguins, lots of fishes🐟 to Collect and also super Power-Ups🎆! Who could possibly rate this FANTASTIC  game with 1 STAR?!?!?!??🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌",
        "I &lt;3 it! I love super penguins! I showed it to my 11 year old brother and he loves it! And I showed it to my dad. He likes it 2. It is so addicting! The only thing that annoys me is that when there is a tied up penguin and I miss it I feel bad I know it is just a game, but the squeals and the whining, it makes me sad will give 5 stars if fixed."

        "Awesome game if u love strategy & buissness tactics with football......plz upgrade the game play in exhibition or others game play into 3d & give a weekly basis youth squad facility....fans need it...& love it",
        "Surprisingly deep experience. I suppose the obvious comparison would be to Soccer Spirits. This is a lot more grounded in reality (there's a lot less talking rabbits and little girls who can do magic), but there's more to do. There's also a dry cleverness permeating everything.  UPDATE: I've hit a weird and frustrating wall--the game isn't clear about when its days roll over. I guess it might be UTC (there are several indications that the game originates in the UK), but for a few days, my daily quests were rolling over at midnight Pacific Time (like most of these games that punish players for not playing every day), but today I noticed that there doesn't seem to be ANY consistency regarding when daily quests begin and end. Anyway, I'm docking two stars (I otherwise believe that this is a five-star game) until the game's daily rollover time is clarified. I had a nice streak going, that the game's failure to communicate ruined.",

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update."

        "I had the original game fairway  solitaire  on my iPad i tried to download that one but it said that it wasn't compatible to my phone. So I downloaded this one at first I didn't like it little confusing but now I love it the only thing that I recommended being able to find out what is power of means at any given time meaning I can go back days from now to find out what that power up mean otherwise I would recommend this game to anyone",
        "I hate games that say. Free. Then to advance you mustI pay  Or log into Fb.  I would just log on and find games, so far I can advance without paying maybe watch an ad. I have a similar game and you just watch ads for coins. If u like paying, then this is a good one. You can play once in a while. I guess. Good game. I would pay for the game itself, but not for a level. Make a pay game then allow a choice. FB making money. Iove it nonetheless. I play on, and it has gotten better.🤗",
        "Great game enjoyed on iPad.  Glad you made it for Android.  Would give all Stars if only for one glitch so far! Can't change profile picture or display name gives error code invalid username.  Wish it would be able to remember my level and placement weather I'm using WiFi or not! right now if WiFi not turned on it woodcut give current stats.  Please fix!",
        "Love this game. Challenging but also a lot of fun. This h as become one of my favorite games. What I really am getting hooked on are the daily challenges. The boosters are the \"bomb\"! This has become my go to game. And I will  add harder as you  progress. Still hooked! Level 234 and still can't get enough! I love it but it's getting really difficult. But still hooked! Still playing. Love the tourneys! Now at level 370 plus and still going!!",
        "Very addictive & fun. I've been playing for about 3 months & having fun with it.  It's so addicting, I don't even want to put the phone down. **Well, I'm still playing, even though I did take about a 3 month break from the game, but I missed playing it...so here I am. You know, you just need a break every once-in-a-while. I'm rambling now, but all-in-all this app is a great way to pass the time & have fun while you're doing it.",
        "Fun Fun & More Fun...Great  Game  Learning more about the game daily. In addition it makes playing solitaire totally exciting. Very Unique & Fun Game & Good  Way To Pass Away Time. I Love This Game So Much I Play It Daily.Just Love This Game! The only complaint is that I don't always receive my bonus points wish I could get Them"

        "Where's the 720 potbucks?!  Liars.  Pot farm brought me here.  Need more sexy babes.  A first person shooter mode too, like halo 1 online. Just nother point n click, like bleach online mmorpg.  The game that has all sexy babes no dudes, and the chicks beat dudes and practice femdom, we probably get the highest ratings and be the most popular lol.",
        "This is not the game i watched a video for. I would like to play that game (if it exists) but the link brought me this steamer. I'm sure your well aware of this as you've had plenty of reviews saying as much so its obvious to me you dont care. Great way to build a loyal customer base",
        "The game was fun for a little while, but it becomes quite monotonous. The game isn't interactive enough to keep you coming back for more. You more or less just watch your heroes battle which takes a lot of possible fun out of the game right away. If you spend any cash at all on the game, you unlock the ability to \"raid\" your already completed missions. So then when you need items, you will just mash the raid button until your energy is gone. And the energy recharges VERY slowly. You can play for free, but will progress substantially slower than the pay-to-play player. So overall, it's fun for a short while (a week or two), but you will quickly grow tired of it due to poor interactivity. If you are looking for a game similar to this that will keep your interest and has much more to offer, I would recommend Summoners War.",
        "Game apparently 'malfunctioned' and the heroic chest kept saying open free.  This was after I spent $25 US dollars so of course I thought why wouldn't I get some free opens?  I didn't know they were charging me 200 emeralds a pop.  Customer service was NO help.  Hopefully I can get a refund from Google Play.  Don't download!  Bad programming, scam in game purchases!",
        "While the game seems nice enough, it is nothing like the advertisement I watched. Complete misrepresentation gets one star."

        "Was more enjoyable to play before the update. Before I could move items I bought now everything I buy ends up in upper left corner. Cannot really even see each item. I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "Only wasted my time for a few levels then got rid of this pretty quick! Why waste your time completing levels, earning coins to buy stuff to decorate  when whatever you buy just gets a ll plopped down in one spot and cannot be moved. That's NOT decorating!!!! Fix that and I may be back.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average.",
        "This game bites. In the middle of game it freezes up or just returns to the start screen,if you can't fix this problem I'm uninstalling."

        "This game is wonderful for me since I'm very Shakey and tapping obsessively is very fun it's a little confusing to upgrade but when you figure it out it's very fun I loved it and recommend this to everyone",
        "Fun",
        "The game has bugged out now the hero's that did the time challenges are stuck I cant get them back.  I think it happend when the anniversary update hit and I put them in a time challenges during the time.  When I prestige and go to the time challenges it goes straight back to the main menu. And when i do have hero's  in the adventure mode it cuts to them when I pick the time challenges.  Please fix this.  And also happy anniversary 😀   Problem was fixed thank you very much!😊",
        "The game is fine but like all mobile games or eventually gets to the point where it's purely about you parting with money to proceed. That being said even tho this game uses ads for it's reward system it's actually quite pleasant, at no point did it become ridiculous or over the top. I really do appreciate how much of a back seat it it feels like the adds are taking to gameplay.",
        "Almost A Hero is an incredibly fun game with lots of interesting heros to use to battle near endless hordes of baddies. I find myself loading up the game multiple times a day to grab the free chest as well as to push through another couple waves before my next prestige. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this genre!",
        "Update: Ads are broken. I watched almost any that were presented to me in order to get farther faster but now they literally always load up a few seconds, then the game like restarts and I get jack from it. Dudes! Please fix, I am so very rarely addicted to a game like I am/was with this!!  Literally the best clicker/idle game I've ever played. I was glued to my phone for all of my free time five days straight because new and awesome stuff kept getting unlocked."

        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data..",
        "This game is awesome and addictive. My second First Person Shooter Game After Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation.  I only wish the Game Developers can bring back the game control we had in Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation; especially in terms of the gun control, and also create an offline PvP mode using Hotspot and Wi-Fi to connect players. Putting these two features in place will make this game undisputed First Person Shooter Game Ever.  In the near future, we should be considering how one can make real cash while playing online games like this."

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",

I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?"

I also think it takes WAY TOO LONG to evolve Characters, and overall the add-ons are FAR TOO EXPENSIVE for what you are getting, but you don't HAVE TO spend money if you don't want to.",
        "The game is a great game, I love how they added characters from all eras, it sorta reminds me of turtles in time. The only huge downfall of this game is that it's pretty much a pay to play game smh. I've never seen a game that is so money hungry in my life. The $10 monthly subscription  is absurd, the SFX ingame dont work and for 5 bucks more you can play Elder scrolls online that has a ton of content compare to this game.",
        "Subscription should come with better benefits. $10 a month...6 months worth I could've bought an xbox game. Ya know. Pizza re-gen should be a bit quicker. Some people like to grind. And the pizza limitation kills the grind. Good graphics tho, and great characters. But waaaay to hard to acquire the turtles. Big let down on that aspect",
        "Great game just wished Very amazing game especially if you are a turtles fan.. lots of choices with characters.. you can definitely get stronger without having to pay.. you just need to put in the time , and do  do daily event's.. i wish some characters were easier to get;))",
        "After a long battle with the worst customer service i have ever dealt with i will regrettably no longer be playing this game. The game itself is pretty solid but is a money sink. If you need help from the company you may as well quit. The game is a solid 4/5 but the company's attitude and considering you being disposable sadly makes them a 1/10"

You can spin any game, at any bet level, even buy more chips but the payouts absolutely disappear. It will  happen to you, trust me.  Beware of Jackpot Party!  THEY FLEECE THEIR PLAYERS!",
        "Got the feeling playing for free is a frowned upon activity. Ads won't play to get free coins, coins I did get went so fast it's just not worth it. I wonder if your advertisers know you block videos from playing. I could understand if it were for real money but this is (WAS) my bathroom game.",

        "I use to actually win back in the day on this app but now it's about impossible. Also the ad videos for free coins is a complete scam !!!! You receive 200k coins which is basically a spin and you will not win. All free coins from ads will not produce any wins. Please tell me there is not a different payout percentage off the ad coins. But you're making real money from us watching  the ad. Mmmmmmmm....",

We used to be able to purchase potions in guild shop for reasonable  amount but that has changed because the game administration wants more money. This makes me sad because many long time players are leaving  the game. New players will never know just how fun this game once was. :-(",

        "Won't even let me play not worth your time.",
        "Not a bad game, don't need money really to level up and get to a good standing against others. It goes pretty quick till level 65ish  and starts to slow down. If you want to spend money it helps speed leveling and getting your guys up stronger faster obviously. If you have patience and don't mind not leveling to fast, or just taking your time in general this game is for you. Lots to do. My favorite part is trying to find a way to make my team the strongest I can, using the massively different combos of hero's u can use and all the things you can add to them to make them stronger. You can literally go with a 1 man team or a 5 man team based on materials u have to equip them with to make sure they can last in battle. Have fun and good luck all... Been playing for 100 days now, game is getting better players  wise, support  wise not so hot.. they only get back to you when they feel like it I guess, there was a problem I had like a month ago they kinda jumped on right away. But I messaged them a few days ago and they have yet to reply... Gonna drop the stars due to this. Love the game tho, be better to your players developers..",

When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",

So please fix the problem.  Thanks",

        "More and more focus on pay to win and the 4th weapon, the distance weapon makes it too complex and disturbing. In particular the boomerangs because there are almost no chances to avoid a hit. In unequal battles the inferior just got an extra disadvantage --&gt; no David vs goliath anymore possible. It sucks",
        "This is the worst chapter or update in  the game.. when I saw notification of the update I was very excited but when I opened this game the main quest was insane difficulty so I started side quest which was easy difficulty, but it was not for me it was easy for the enemy.. I played that more than 10 times but I didn't win 2 rounds so I just came here and wrote this review... And if you think I'm a noob.. then yes I am but only in this chapter not in previous ones..",
        "At first look it didn't mesmerise me, but after 2-3 matches I feel in love with it! It is awesome and has tons of weapons and other stuffs. The multiplayer option is also great and chest opening is such a treat. One worry is that the weapon below the primary weapon is still locked (why I don't know), otherwise the game is superb. Graphics are top notch and fighting doesn't come more realistic than that!",
        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "After the latest update, in side quest - wasteland I won twice both the times the game hung up but when the opponent wins it moves through to next easily. I can attach the screen shot of wanted.. kindly fix this it's frustrating  Now for the third time this has happened gonna uninstall the game bye",
        "The 1st Main Mission of chapter 4 hot stucked. I deafeated my opponent and it has stocked at that point. Closed the game and started again, the the mission is in same position. Again I played that mission and after defeating the game stucked again. The same thing happened 5 times in a row. Very much Dissapointed."

I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

        "Good app but few glitches. One day I was playing against computer. It made a miraculous move of eating my pawn at a place where none of my pawn ever existed. Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on..",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "The last update sucks! Premove is not at all intuitive. It now just shows the block which we want to move the pawn and doesn't move the pawn itself like before. The toast message that showed 'challenge rejected' was better than the current one. Dislike it!!",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team."

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting"

        "This has a lot of potential. Connection issues are horrendous after this last update. Also, add a help section that explains what everything means. Lots of stats, numbers, ratings, etc. that we have to figure out on our own. Another thing, stopped receiving notifications after updating to Oreo.",
        "Overall it's pretty fun and addicting.  My only real issue came up with today's update. My 40-rated team got matched to play against a 60-rated team in my first Challenge game. wut",
        "The game was great until the update. Took my team from a 43 to a 41. Put alot of time into it, hope this gets worked out. They also nerfed training. Don't even bother wasting 15 coins on an extra session.",
        "Update: ***500 coins for ~350k in game cash isnt even 1 rookie signing.... you can get 3 star players for that kind of coin. **** the latest updates have added cool new features like the coach analysis, fewer bugs and more consistency. The coach analysis function could be cool but every description is \"this player is making great progress, keep pushing him!\" Even for aging players who are getting worse as the seasons progress. It does however project where the player could trend stats wise.  Still no goalie stats. Still no trade options (not sure how that would wotk) but they added refunds to contracts you release from your roster which depend on the player and their contract value,  time remaining etc...  Would be cool to also be able to make in game adjustments, like if your star goalie is letting goal after goal slip through swapping goal tenders would be nice otherwise there doesn't really seem to be a point in having 2 goalies even on the roster.  Overall it's a Fun game with a LOT of potential, if you're a fan of hockey you should definitely give this a try. Would like to see some of these things as the game develops",
        "Please fix how it automatically signs a new player if you don't renew a contract.. the purpose is to dump cap space and it signs some random player and then won't let me release him.  Also STOP changing my line ups. At any point any time ever. There's no need to change it or else you night as well play the game for me. I spend alot of time re doing them and then next thing I know every thing is changed. Not sure why or what causes it buy it is annoying as hell",
        "Overall it is a decent game. However finding an opponent for the games especially the rank games sucks. Either you get another player who is far superior to you or another who is far below your level. It needs to be more equal to be fun."

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

        "This game is so old school and gta 5 is so much better than this game but it is still worth playing. It has a lot of cheats and hacks but it is still very good. It plays up very x1000000 rare. This game is very fun and if you have seen my comment please download this game immediately because it's extremely fun and it is very easy to collect money ps its okay to play offline and if you have seen my comment i recommend you to download this game immediately and have a great time",
        "I loved this game wh3n I was young and this brings back the best memories of my child hood haha.. the controls are kinda lumpy when steering a vehicle. But all other movements are pretty good. Butt,if you happen to have a Xbox one s controller it works perfect on my galaxy s8 plus. Thanks for porting this game to android and giving the option to max the graphics out. Looks very good! Loving the portal game feel too haha!",
        "Just started, i am playing with an Xbox One controller and everything works perfect.  The only problem is you are stuck with the original controls and cant change the buttons functions.  I wish i could use the triggers for gas and braking for driving the cars like in GTA's 4 and 5.  Other than that everything is good.  A classic game, that runs smoothly, and is a great time nostalgia trip.   This one works so well that i am definitley buying the other ports as soon as i am done with this one.",
        "Game could be grate Game looks awesome but the controls don't work right. Walking and running is not fluid. It's stop and go. While driving it is very hard to steer while pressing the gas pedal. I have Max Payne and the controls in that are great what happened with GTA San Andreas. Please fix. Also could you make it so I can move the game to my SD Card. I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 4.",
        "Guys help please! i gave the game 5 stars because i like it so much. But there's a probleme that im facing now when changed devices i had all my data saved on a samsung alpha device, now i reinstalled the game on my new samsung s6 edge and i loged in, and there was no cloud save. Please help me find a way to fix this! Thank you"

When swiping it doesn't always read the swipe and kick it for a try through ball. When shooting the swipe isn't constant, I can swipe as fast as i can and it goes 54mph. Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue. Atm the game isn't going to be played much more because it gets frustrating when it isn't working right.",

Keep playing the same level over and over until you can upgrade, play another level, then proceed to keep playing the same level again. The competitive mode is also messed up as the opponent gets scores near impossible",
        "Everything is great and good but only have one problem. And this problem will killing you all. That's the loading is damn slow no matter you are in LTE network or wifi situation. Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",
        "Even with a perfect LTE speed game struggled with downloading hunts. The game forces you to do certain hunts before you can go back to the ones you like and want to finish. Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",
        "Awsome game, the only thing wrong with it is that it takes forever to load. The graphics are amazing and so is the gameplay. This is something that could keep me entertained all day and I wouldn't get bored.😺👌",
        "The game currently wont open, when it does its constantly crashing and force stopping. I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",
        "During cts theres moments get sudden lag and it throws off the shooting causing to miss when i know aiming right. It never had these lag bits before."

        "It's fun, but I can't play it once I get to the mist part in section 1-2, the game freezes but the music keeps playing... If the devs make an update that fixes this, I'll play, but until then, since I can't play it properly, it's off my phone. Sorry devs, it's amazing but I can't play it right now",
        "The characters look amazing! I haven't got any legendaries yet. Very fun and challenging! One complaint is that in breakout mode, you have to start roght from the beginning. Regardless, it's great!!",
        "Can you pls put in a feature to migrate the data from Line Cookie Run? Line Cookie Run is closing down soon but I have so much memories collecting my cookies and treasures and I already had so much! To lose everything is making me a little heartbroken :'(",
        "Amazing game I love it so addicting...... I played every day all day that's how addicting it is no we got something to do in the game there's 70 different types of things you can do there always doing something on the game whether it's racing competing challenging amazin",
        "I'm a bit reluctant at first trying this new CookieRun from the previous LINE version, but I regret it, I should have play this sooner. Everything is so addicting with new system and better music and graphics as well, awesome!"

The graphics are amazing no flaws there and as a new player right now the newcomer rewards are so helpful.",

But don't join the game until they bring out a new server, impossible to complete with long time playing players unless you're willing to spend a hell of a lot of money to catch up. Current two servers I play on are pretty dead due to this.",

        "Sorry to say, but in terms of balance it is the worst game I have played so far. This game is the most unbalanced game, even for beginners. Currently I have 4 heroes and the funny part is that all four are weak against defense, such as a cannon, a rail gun, 2 stars for the full upgrade. Even high level players can attack on beginners. Defence is too much high for the attacking players, against 2 heros unit and I've noticed that lower level players can not overcome my defence while high-level players pass easily. This game is good and entertaining, there is not much flaw in this game, but this game is very unbalanced and unfair. Many players have complained about this.",

        "I loved the game up until the date of this review. Too many new customizations require leaf tickets. Which translate into micro-transactions. I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "Not really an action game app. If you like Mafia Wars than this is perfect for you.   UPDATE: Downtown Wars is by far not a bad game. The question is it a game for you. The animation is very limited so if you enjoy action then this is not a game for you. The best way to describe what I noticed after playing game for nearly a week, that it is a long level up game of tag. The comment board is one of the best aspects because you can communicate with the community most important you gang/mob members which helps for team building.",
        "Very interesting and a nice game to pass time, love the BGM! Really like the changeable tags, it's so convenient to change it according to our mood/status and the profile erase option without losing the mob WOW! A really big thumps up to that! It also kinda reminds me of Mob Wars and Extreme Mob Wars etc which got me feeling nostalgic because I was really into it but, DTM tops it all! ;) Forgot to mention this, we can put space in our name! That's so convenient! Cool!",
        "I think Elites should be boosted atleast 100 Points - 20 billion then 1000 Points - 40 Billion is 10x the work for 2x the reward.  A huge change could be game breaking but raising it to 80 Billion would give new players a chance against older players that give their minis huge collects every tourney.",
        "Very good game but it could be better. Like when uv got multiple invites u should be able to accept them all in one instead of one at a time. But that's my only gripe. Apart from that it's a brilliant game much better than the dead imobsters. 1 more thing where can we find the boss iron fist who's attacked me a couple of times but I can't find him to attack him back. How can you recover ur account when uv forgot Google account details.",
        "For me with all the rejuvenation down time, I get bored. But when the favors work,  it becomes a really fun game to keep your mind busy.  But by having multiple games like this it's Kool to toggle  between them. The graphics are great.   My Love for this game comes from the interactive game plot. You have to build networks with fellow gamers to rank.  And likewise building enemies.",
        "Great game. I have played this game for years. It just continues to get better.  Recently in last 24 hours my phone crashed and I got it back up and running. But only when I open this game. Does it say UNABLE TO REACH SERVER. I don't know what's wrong. It won't let me open game at all. Plz fix for me"

        "I really love this game, you get rewarded for prioritizing property and it's very satisfying to finish the level with a perfect score when you time everything just right. The diamonds are a little bit too rare to get and since half the updates are priced with diamonds the end result is each location doesn't get 100% upgraded, witch is a little bit frustrating. I love that when you revisit a level it's slightly different, makes it much more interesting. It's a lovely little game, kudos to the developers and designers!",
        "1. This should have an UNLIMITED LIVES option. The stages per level are unenjoyably difficult enough --why do you have to limit the player's chance to try and be better?? Some levels are impossible for human fingers already.  2. You should lessen the required number of diamonds as value of items to upgrade!!! A player only gets 9 diamonds per level achieved. 10 gems per upgrade is ok, but 50??? FIX THIS ASAP or people will be deleting this app.",
        "I love it cuz it's the best but some of the costumers are feisty. The old lady takes three the man and boy takes two things. The young lady is fine. She takes 1 stuff. The little girl I hate her. She rides her scooter in the shop when she know full well she post to ride her scooter outside. But everything else is okay.",
        "I always love supermarket mania. I played supermarket mania 1 and 2 and expect great things for this. But, no, this game infuriates me. The pace is really slow and the customer stream is to long. More over, it use diamonds for essential upgrades like cashier (why should i upgrade cashier??) and cart. Grinding diamonds is a pain in the ass. I think the developer only think of making money than make this game enjoyable to it's player.",
        "I like this game but it needs to give better options earn Crystal's and it should not cost you as many if any at all to move to next level. I play a lot of games and don't mind spending a few dollars but now I'm turned off from it. Yall need to do better. I Won't suggest it to any of my friends for that reason alone.",
        "I really have fun with this game. I also like how you can earn the crystals through playing, not absolutely having to pay. One thing that would be nice was to have the option to fast forward especially with times when you're just waiting for customers or the elderly ladies to finish shopping. Also an endless challenging round would be awesome. Thanks =)"

        "Enjoyed the game. Very fun and im actually spending which is rare for me.   I dont like the orb prices go up with each new arena. I wont be spending now im in in arena 4 those prices are just not worth it. Id also like the ability to save a few different decks. And make gold earning a bit easier its not balanced. Im in arena 4 and been saving gold for over a week not spending on anything opening orbs. And i still cant upgrade any of my cards.   Tbh as much as i enjoy the game. If i cant upgrade without spendig then ill wind up uninstalling eventually",
        "Love it! Very interesting and fun to play, but i have a suggestion. You should add some spells (Poison, Heal...). They don't have to be overpowered, just for slightly more fun gameplay! Also they should be regular cards (Heroes). And one more thing: bring some advatage to players that don't start first in the match, because it's easier to win when you are playing first.",
        "Very unique and fun strategy game. Easy to understand from the first game. Very forgiving to newcomers but if you want to get good, it takes planning and learning. Fun to pick up and play throughout the day. My only problem is that if you sit and play for more than a few minutes, you'll waste alot of orbs winning games. You can spend gems to free up slots, but I'd rather just not receive orbs until I have a free slot. Good game.",
        "I wish that your global rank was more intuitive and less complicated to acquire. Also on the achievement's it says that I can't get the last 2 stars on the found heroes however I have all that I can get. I also wish there was a pm option as the leader of a clan I want to give constructive criticism but not call them out in the chat.. other than that it fully deserved the 5 star.. thanks for makeing this and keep smashing!!😋",
        "The game itself its good, but lack of fun. To upgrade cards you need money which is hard to get in the game and from the clan. In free chest and common orbs you never get any rare cards and money is too less. Would be fun if the cards could be developed faster and if they would have a counter attack possibility when you upgrade it to certain level. You could implement a coop when each plyer choose 2 cards from deck or something similar. In addition I would change which player starts, should be based on the deck strenght. I would also implement the position of the cards on the field and which card is in front and which card in the back, by that you need to start a bit more strategic. Hope that something happens with the gameplay soon, before more players leave. Good luck",
        "Love the game. Really fun to play and balanced so even non paying players can do well. One complaint I have is the new addition of zombie has a bug, when hitting a buffed opponent the poison touch doesnt replace the buff. Please fix this issue."

        "Great game!!! Still some bug's. You have to log out and log back in to collect the 5 hour daily rewards. Sometimes you can't post in the chat rooms. It will say invalid character. A lot of lag at times when you use the power and impact gauge. There needs to be more options to customize character's and or add more. I also believe the daily 5 hour rewards need to change instead of the same rewards everyday. It is a fun game, and highly addictive. Great graphics, which still could be improved on, looking at newer golf games coming out.",
        "Great game.  Only problem is the huge 10 second warning that covers your shot.   Also the game meter jumps.  So I get penalties for taking longer than 10 seconds when I let the control bar reset.",
        "Almost great. The UI is a crowded mess. Too much nonsense. The equipment tabs are broken due to bugs(I downloaded on several devices) making it impossible to accurately navigate between items, and the putting is rigged(obvious padding) resulting in missed shots that shouldn't happen. Besides these glaring flaws there is great potential here.",
        "A great game easy to play and progress.  Only issue is i can't work out how to change my country from the usa to aus. Sick to death of my putts begging taken off me because you have ridiculously stupid gamer play.  If I putt a ball in real life and it hits the edge of a cup it goes in 90 pc of the time.  If I putt one to the lip of the cup in real life it goes ohm.  But bout your retarded physics.  They stop the ball on the edge or knock it away from the hole. What a load of bulls$/^.

But, Paradise seems pretty cool so far, only thing I'm not a big fan of is how everything deals with irl money while in the 'old' one you could build up gems or materials for certain things like VIP levels; also I heard about rewards being given to old players like me? That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",

        "Only challenging for nonpaying playing. Not a big fan of pay to win games. But LoA is always addicting and just makes you want to spend your money. Not suitable if you're addicted to that overall. More nonpaying support would be reasonable for them to at least be able to compete.",
        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",

No explanations on some features, you have to figure it out by trial and error wasting resources. I'm at castle level 15, dragon level makes no difference so far only troop level does. Events are useless because the top spenders take everything before you can even find the location. Misleading descriptions in-game costing you resources. This is utter BS and far from anything tactical as advertised. Drains battery faster than any app/game I've ever encountered",

Also improve tha game's matchmaking skills",

        "Great Game and concept and all... But the multiplayer is so offballanced. I'm only like level 3 and yet I keep getting people who are at least level 80. Also the new zombie hero (Huge-Giganticus) needs to be nerfed as soon as possible. Lastly, whoever makes the daily challenges needs to stop, they are practically impossible to beat and the reward isn't that great.",

Moreover, players who had issues about the internet connectivity problems of while they're watching an ad and letting your opponent to win in multiplayer. Not only that but the Super Block Meter is keeping a lot buggy. Fix these problems now."

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "I'm a sports junkie so of course this game drew my attention. Wasn't sure about the gameplay at first, but I like this game enough to play everyday. I actually have some decent ideas for this game that could put it over the top. If the app developers actually read this review then you should contact me. I have ideas that would make this game have an even broader spectrum in the marketplace, reaching not only sports nuts like myself, but gamers in general.",
        "I like the plays, plus you can put it on auto and watch it if you get tired. Just one problem. Your Dev people need to look into this: I thought if the spinner landed in the bright green, your play would go the yards it was supposed to. If it landed in the dark green, your play would gain a few more yards. Now the bad stuff. If the spinner landed in the bright red, your play and your opponent's play would fail and if it landed in the dark red, the ball was either fumbled or intercepted, depending upon the play. That's what happens to me, but not to my opponent. Many times when the spinner goes to the red, between the 40 yard line and the goal line, he will spin, and the spinner landed in the red. He will get a touchdown. His play was supposed to fail.",
        "I love this game alot but it's getting annoying now. I had to restart bc I lost my other game but my team is about 80points good. I just lost to a team that has 40. I find that sad. My team is way better. Not the first time bc I've lost to a 40,46,50,63,75. Please make it harder for teams that are low beat a time higher then them. Make it more challenging for teams that are lower",
        "I like the game overall but the clock management is really bad. Like 40 seconds for a play? At least add timeouts or make the plays not waste so much time. Also yall should add playoffs for the season, not jus win win win and win. It should be more competitive in the season mode and not just winning cause it gets boring. That's what I suggest but overall the game is good . Pls reply and make a huge update . :)",
        "Are you kidding me. Blitz doesnt help against the run. It absolutly does. And you are seriously telling me that i cant make 10 passing plays in a row. I absolutly can in real life. So unrealistic.",
        "Other than you can't see a lot of the plays it's a really good game. But one thing .you guys should put more indept into the game by letting us see more plays .instead of only the plays that counts. I myself want to see indept plays. But other than that. It a great game"
