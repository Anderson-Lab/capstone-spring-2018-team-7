        "Bright, colorful, addictive game play. Adorably happy graphics. Love \"Mr. Encouragement\", who exclaims \"sweet!\", & \"delicious!\" in his baritone voice. The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. ThanksüòÑ",
        "good way to teach us to be patient should we prefer to play freely.   Occasionally error.  KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",
        "entertains well. but plz try to improve the swiping feature ncz when we want to play the first or second episode ,have to swipe all over down n got fed up with that, its taking too much time to do so. its really urgent to improve that thing.",
        "Very disappointed in this app over the last several months.  Every time I go into app to play game I get kicked out.  It is not always immediate which is very frustrating because I will loose lives etc UN-necessarily."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pok√©mon and I intend to play Pok√©mon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though.",
        "I am currently on vacation and this app has given me more points of interest than using Google Maps alone!!  Every single pokestop is something interesting...  I don't know why I didn't think to use it for this sooner.  I've seen more in this city today than I have the 3 days I've been here!"

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I absolutely adore this app for it's witty, adorable characters and simple yet infinite concepts. I'm addicted! I have one issue, though. The limits on the barn and silo, frankly suck. I have eleven duct tapes but no screws so I had to pay diamonds I didn't want to spend so I could have a little flexiblility! Please fix this.",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan"

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update",
        "its a nice game, but please rate the places lil bit low, it's hard to earn money, and when we save it for a place to buy, a raid takes place... increase the spin no. also atleast from 50 tp 60... it was fun at first.. but due to all this it's becoming boring.",

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "I really enjoyed this game for a while. But anytime theres any sort of update the app wont load up. And it just so happens that whenever this occurs it's during a kill event. I cant explain how stressful this game can become if you actually commit to playing it",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",

        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "It's a really great game but there are some flaws to it. First of the game is reall laggy for me and tends to always disconnect me in a game and I fell as if the reporting thing doesnt work either because they are never really blpcled for a while but those are tge only things but overall its an amazing game",
        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",
        "The game is great but the problem is that some players bully us not good loking so why not add ads to watch them to get free robux can you please add that so that we can focus on our looks so we don't get bullued thanks üòÄ",
        "ROBLOX IS AMAZING!!! However the thing that keeps bothering me is that I have seen a lot of people getting bullied even me.... ROBLOX pls update this so everyone has 100 robux üòä",

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time.

Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complainüòâ best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. üòÅ It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own üí∞. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game."

Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off.

        "I have been playing this for 1.5 years. I love everything about this game. They always have fun events - usually 2-3 events occur at the same time. You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",
        "I love this game! I play at every opportunity I get. Thanks for helping me set up the game on my tablet. I have however, run into another issue I hope you can help me resolve. I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

        "Good game. I love the fact you can get premium crystals or gems easily and on a regular basis.  Only thing I don't like is the golden cup shots or whatever they are called. Make an option to use those gems for shots instead of real cash would be nice but still earned 5 stars. Samsung galaxy note 8",
        "I think everything is fantastic about the game, but after this last update. The loading time is 20x slower if it loads at all. Galaxy phone. I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game üëç",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the actionüòÑ. This is always an exciting game.üòâAh, always an awesome game.üòÜThis is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! üíú",
        "This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven't experienced anything toxic, yet. I've been playing for about a week and it's really great"

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "Updates keep getting stuck with the ver 3.8.1. Since it was released. Download 269 out of 269 but nothing happens after that, and a message of \"connection error\" keeps appearing. Have passed the daily log in bonus, and will probably lose the consecutive login bonuses as a result. Didn't create transfer code or link to fb account yet so may risk of losing account if I reinstall. Please fix this asap.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star"

Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",

Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",

This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",

I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAƒ∞N that SYSTEM Dƒ∞Vƒ∞Sƒ∞ON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER Dƒ∞Vƒ∞Sƒ∞ON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is üëå I love it",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs",
        "I think u guys should find a way for us(we the managers) to get tokens easier . I don't understand why winning the league or champions league only gets you money but no tokens . it really sucks"

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gda≈Ñsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Man√© in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "The match making system could be improved. Match making is based on your level but does not take into account the level of the ship. To test this I took a Heavy Fighter At level 11 and was being matched up with Frigates. No chance in heck to win for me. Even at higher levels it's hard to win if your opponent has a ship 3-4 steps above you. A limit of 2 levels above and below for ships would be a good fix.",
        "A truly enjoyable game with a few simple strategies that somewhat take the fun away.   For instance, warp drives have a big chance of putting you behind the other guy where your thrusters and generators usually are(it's more or less game over if they get destroyed). If you go for a laser heavy they'll have no way of defending since they can't put armor and thrusters and shields don't block lasers.   Also you can't name your ship which is a bit of a missed opportunity",
        "I also liked the game more at lower levels. Maybe you could make it like a loss drops your rating by so many points. I hit lvl 130 and barely win a fight with either of the three of my ships. If we could drop points, maybe we could get 3 straight wins or 5 a day. The higher the rank, obviously means harder opponents. But my ships are only so strong while saving up money to by better upgrades or a better ship. Please fix this",
        "Great game, really fun gameplay. The feature of being able to earn up to ~50 celestium (in game paid currency) by playing the game and doing daily achievements is really good. Only gripe is that there is no confirmation button for spending celestium leading to accidently spending it at a miss-tap and no way to undo these purchases. Other than that very good.",
        "This game if fun....but after trying a couple of the free offers to gain in game currency and never receiving the funds I will be uninstalling. I contacted fyber(the ad company that gives out the currency) and they say they gave the compensation. I cannot support a game that blatantly states that funds may not be awarded and still uses the fraud company. It is a great disservice to the player base and I will not stand for it",
        "Fun concept and decently executed. So much so players don't see the pay to win till you get to level 10 ( the black market is locked till then). The items inside the black market take cash currency in large quantities. And even though you can earn the cash currency, the amount is petty and will take forever to stack up.  Though I can't see people popping in the large quantities of cash to be on top in this game, the possibility exists. Especially when most free to play games have players who are in house ( employees and other sources) and get damn near unlimited in game currency to force the public to invest into the game to compete for top ratings and bragging rights..."

        "Updated This game has become about how much time and MONEY you can spend on it. They don't care about issues in game or what feed back they get. There are hundreds of issues that don't get addressed they just add more and more content hope people ignore the issues. Thed new content creates new issues and in some cases makes old issues worse",
        "Don't bother. Pay players only do well. And it's expensive! Devs have it programmed for pay players so you fall far behind and can't catch up. They match you against pay players that are always stronger. Contests are extremely difficult. Been playing for 2 years so I know what I'm commenting about.",
        "Ever since the new owners took over, content has lessened. Although new heroes appear, it is all about money scams and contests. Turned down drop rates make it nearly impossible to upgrade with dropping piles of cash.",
        "Used to be a fun game with silly characters and lots to do. Since sold by per blue game quality has plummeted. Deleted and moved on to other games that run smoother and appreciate customer feedback.",
        "The text in game as become tiny almost unreadable since last update. Am I the only one? I'm playing on galaxy S8.",
        "One of my accounts was stolen, I had it connected to FB, Google & Email, I have gotten an email asking for things they need to verify, I sent what I could, name, server, etc, I also sent pics of the name it was when I had it and the name they changed it to, also the guild name, still not heard a thing back? It can't be that hard to get it back, I known a few ppl working in the gaming area, and they say it's pretty easy that you guys probably could care less, as long as you get your money...I really like playing it, I've put money into it, but security is horrible if I can have it connected to 3 things, yet someone can still steal it???.....Very disappointed now."

That said if u can get it to work it's a cute game with fun characters but not much in the way of gameplay.. click wait 3 hours click wait 2 hours click wait 4 hours and so on..",
        "Awesome concept on the stories, but it's nothing but a money hungry game. First thing they need to fix, the crashes. Can't even play the game for more than a minute before it shuts down. So you take my money, then you don't let me play. Thanks Fox. Been months now and I can't even play. How you expect me to spend money when the damn game won't run for longer than a minute !",

Also they need to bring back the Star Trek part again!",

Still....... i love the game",

Y'all ripping us off with these tables because it said unlocked at level 19 then I go to buy the table it say unlock at level 22 SMH I'm on level 20 & I only got 10 tables... won't be spending no more money on this game!",
        "I love this game. I've been playing for a while now but the price of stuff is too expensive. I just barely made the money to get the Hawaiian barman and now his price went  from 60,000 to 81,000. This is too much. Please drop the prices down.                  Edit: thank you for the updates. I started over but everything is much better priced I love it!",
        "What could have been really fun turned out to be quite frustrating. I love this game but due to your policy of not providing sufficient tools for expansion makes me giving it only one star. Indirectly forcing gamers to pay for stuffs sucks real big time. I hope you will bring some changes to make it playable again for the gamers who dont want to buy gems.",

Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",

Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. üòü",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",

Sometimes I get matched with people with 2 to 3 times my health and they also have more defense so it's as if they have even more plus can 2 shot me.",
        "It's not stable while playing, it says all the time network issue but, My net speed has 75 Mbps, still having problems while playing this superb game.  Graphics is good Controllers are best.  During phone calls , we lose the match haha usually.",
        "Good game  Except for the constant updates and also why when i use a breaker on someone(example i use laura shiba) and as she hits with her sword the strike move my opponent does still seems to overpower it..wheres the ethic in that? Lost many a battle due to this silly glitch..sort it out!! Once an attack has been made and is hitting the opponent regardless of priority moves it should still count!!",
        "Good graphics. I really wish you could sell rangers and monsters that you don't want. It is way too unorganized for me having all these warriors with flashing buttons saying UPGRADE, when I don't want to waste my coins and crystals on warriors I'm never gonna fight with.",
        "The controls are so bad and unresponsive that I routinely lose battles simply because it's not picking up my inputs. The gameplay is stupid from the fight mechanics to the stupid way you get characters. The game is made as a pay to win and that's just a terrible way to make a game. They keep saying performance enchanements in the updates and I'm just not seeing it. This game is purely a cash grab meant to take peoples money over nostalgia.",
        "Its to much of a gamble. For example i had a match were i started of with block, defense, block. And my opponent had from the looks a breaker, breaker, attack. I got freaking trashed in seconds. Thats the biggest issue for me and like some people leaders are f@#$*** ridiculously powerful. Needs more balance"

        "This game is awesome. The girls are beautiful and the songs are nice. There are a couple of errors I be having with the game though. I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won't get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved",
        "I like music game in general, it's hard to get the game right on mobile. but they manage to get it right here. The LP system prevent you to play continuesly unless you paid. But in my experience the amount is decent enough (this make you enjoy the music more since you dont have to restart to achieve perfection). The card mechanic is added bonus where you can spend hard earn cash. I can see people still enjoying the game without spending anything.",
        "Warning! This game is freakin' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging. The circle disappear sometimes during the live show. Sometimes the app even doesn't recognize my finger touch that makes me miss a circle. But overall. It's a good game  .... ALL HAIL PRINTEMPS AND GUILTY KISS",
        "I love the game definitely but with the new update, it keeps telling me that there's a transmission error then when it went through and finished connecting, it said that the data transfer was successful. I haven't transfered anything to a new device or anything like that. The only options I'm given is to contact support and start a new game in which I definitely don't want to do. It isn't my connection because everything else on my phone that requires WiFi is fine and I can use it. Is this because of the new update?",
        "I love the game and it's wonderful!!  But...  I had i don't know like a glitch or something.  When started to play the rhythm game while I playing suddenly the icon that I should press came faster all or a sudden. But the song is still OK.  After the glitch it becames back to normal.  This happen me for 3 times on the same day. Please fix it. And Thank you.",
        "It's so addicting and a fabulous rhythm game. One thing I'm really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don't do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don't know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls."

I tried to make it work for a day but it's super hard to earn money for upgrades. Even watching ads give so little rewards. Uninstalling. So unfortunate because i really loved the PC version of this.",

You complete the task, you are told you are getting $200 added to you bank account, BUT your $ total does not change.  This makes it hard to get money to spend.  All you can do is breed and sell fish - which takes time.  I reported this and got a prompt response that they are sorry and that they were adding $ and Gems  to my account balances.  Nice, but my $ total did not change.  I did see an increase in my gems.  There is an update 2/21/18 hopefully this will improve some issues.",

For everyone who complaint about money, just relax, breed your discovered expensive fish first and sell it till you have sufficient money. If you have much money you can discover more species freely in order to find magic fish. It's not about speed but it's about passion, strategy, trial error and patient.",

        "Had fun with my brothers after a long time. The games are simple (like those old 8 bit games) and funny. More games are expected. Devs should consider implementing some of the open source free games to make it more engaging. The free version is heavily limited where you'll be locked out for 30 seconds and 5 minutes for every 5mins and 30 mins respectively. In addition, only 2 players can join in the free version. It should be atleast 3 people for a real multi-player (as against dual-player), with ad supported. Premium is very inexpensive, though.",
        "We just spent the last few hours playing these games as a family. It was so much fun.  The kids did not wanna stop playing.    Edit:  After a week or so we are still enjoying AirConsole. It can be hard to get three teenagers to sit and enjoy family time, but this works everytime.  I really recommend this one!",
        "Originally had it at 5 stars. Now has wayy to many ads. Every 30 min makes you take a 5 min break (unless you buy the premium version or whatever). It does have SOME fun games to play with friends....  But It now makes you buy the Super version to play with more than 2 people. So if you want to play with more that 1 friend you have to pay for it. Dont get it",
        "Amazing!!! Being able to play games  on the go is exactly what you need!! A nintendo switch is useless if you have this! Me and my cousins really enjoyed this. However, the only thing I would really want is to view the game on your phone or device instead of on a TV or other things as if everyone who is playing has a nintendo switch and can see their character or whatever on it.

        "This is easily the best console I've ever used. Even if you have a slow internet connection, it still works with almost NO latency. Even the 30 second downtime is good, because it let's you get a quick drink of water. This is my new favorite app.",
        "I would overall give this game 4 stars cause it is very fun and i hope that this app gets very popular. The only problem is that some of the games have swearing and i want to play this with my family. So please make a family friendly section. That is why i rated 4 stars"

Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. üëçüëçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

        "Great for passing time, although at times you get kind of stuck where you can't gather any more materials because of storage capacity but then it takes forever to get the items for upgrade. The coin amount to buy some buildings is quite high on a lot of them, and the same with the trees and extra livestock. All in all I love playing this user friendly game!",
        "It has potential to be a great game. Its just so sloooow because you have to spend gems for almost everything. Its hard to get seeds because it's hard to get gems not everyone can afford to spend on these games. The land expansion sucks!!! It takes way to much, can't get what's needed half the time. Easier ways to get seeds and coins and it will be better.... Thanks!",
        "I enjoy this game. It's very addictive but in a good way. I actually just got my wife hooked on playing it as well.   My one question though, why are there so many differences between the Android system version and the IPhone system  version? On each building, my wife can see each item available and what level is needed to unlock it. That doesn't show on mine. Also, on hers, she has a fair/bazaar looking building, a delivery truck, and a hot air balloon thing.  Why are these not on the android version????",
        "Good game,  potential to be great I enjoy most of this game. To make it even better - more tools or the ability to buy them,  I have land I can't use because I can't clear it.  The ability to move trees,  grass, rocks until we are able to clear them, so we can make better use of our land. Better rewards  for completing collections,  I've gotten coins and 1 or 2 shovels.  Not good considering how long it takes to complete & that it says win up to 10 tools!?!  Better fishing,  I only catch catfish,  bass,  and anchovies.",
        "Half my images are invisible. I can't see half of my buildings or the items to craft, crafted items, items on sale or even my stand. I submitted a report to Storm 8 only to be told in a automated reply that they don't have the staff to handle it and there was nothing that would be done. I loved this game and had recently started over, looking forward to playing. Now, once I hit lvl 8, I'm uninstalling.",
        "Farm story 2 This game could be used and enjoyed more but at this time I am not playing as it is more frustrating them fun.  I need to expand the barn and silo but the things needed are a large amounts and RARE to achieve or even buy in the market.  Frustrated with trying to upgrade my barn so I will be taking a break for a while and will see if I return"

        "I think this app needs to be redesigned as a stand alone non-MMORPG that does not require any form of Sociopathetic Media. Cute design concept. Interesting plot. Clever programming. But I despise anything remotely like Social Media Community gatherings. If people want to meet get outside and go somewhere. The library, park, museum, etc.",
        "I usually download games and get rid of them because they aren't as good as they are made out to be. Also I get bored fast with games. Shards of Magic has been really fun and I play it often everyday when I have time! Nice to have a game that I don't get bored with. Oh! and you can buy gems, however, its easy to accumulate gems just playing! Have fun!",
        "Been a fan since Crystal Saga. Played Wartune when it first came out and participated in the open beta of Dragon pals. Played Crystal Saga 2, am lvl 82 on S1. Now I'm trying your mobile games. Keep up the good work, coming from one of your fans!",
        "Was a great game. But the pay to win has been pushed way way too far. The only way to play competitive anymore is to spend.. and spend big. I have always been happy to buy vip.. but the amounts of money you have to drop now to remain competitive is outrageous. Thanks for killing my favorite mobile app with greed r2.",
        "Game is buggy, you email support... bugs never get fixed.  They run gem promotions to give 30% bonus and it doesnt give any... fraudulent imo.  Dont waste your time.",
        "It's another one of those games that cranks numbers up so high to make us feel special. It's like seeing an item for 4.99. Wowee, it's less than 5! Play summoners war instead. Same concept, less pandering to fragile egos."

        "I've tried many TD so far still playing this one..every level in every map is unique..  its cool how I can pick and lvl Heroes but then it takes awhile to add a new one when running out of gems (since gems are needed for Heroes) unless u pay to keep playing or just to wait for tournaments... it takes patience lol but I don't mind playing again",
        "A great game with unique map designs and user friendly controls, free to play if you have patience and play strategically, pay to win if you want to advance faster. It is especially a good game for busy people like me who can only spend 10-15 minutes per day but need to stay in the game for a large number of days to be competitive. Don't try to use items and gems on every maps, it is fun and challenging to clear them without shortcuts. *Tip for developers*: Instead of giving purchase options for Sethos and Phoenix they could go with Yan and Narlax, gives chance for new players to compete also developers can milk in additional purchases.",
        "Great TD game with decent difficulty and NPCs progression while still maintining a pattern making you work to figure out various strategies.  Ads have never been an issue I honestly cant remember where they are.  I think they may only be for like \"double your rewards for battle\" kind of thing.  90% (A) or better in my oppinion.  Mainly cause I want to see more progression.  Note I am only a few levels in so I dont know if theres a pay to get by an immpassable place yet.",
        "*Updated* SCAM! Games slowly bleeds away your gems without mechanics being apparent. (I lost 300 gems in the last 3 days) Good luck unlocking heroes or content without paying $30-40. -2 stars.",
        "Your game is WAY too hard. I am at level 90+ and found the first 3 worlds great fun and balanced but now you have effectively destroyed the enjoyment factor by making the enemies SO strong that you cannot possibly beat them unless you have max level heroes...and the best max level heroes require so much to level up that without paying an absurd amount of real money you may aswell give up.you have broken what could have been the best game on android with selfish Pay 2 win tactics . Uninstalling after months of enjoyment and gameplay.  You need to fix this and make it challenging but not impossible",
        "It's really addicting, a lot of challenges and puzzles for the towers... really loved it! Good job team!   A bit of improvement: maybe an easier way to access the other worlds would be really good!?"

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks.",
        "This game will cheat you! I  upgraded a bunch of my characters but the next time I logged in nothing had saved! The funds I used to upgrade were also gone, of course. Don't waste money buying anything because the upgrades you make just disappear."

        "After reaching level 15, I was supposed to be awarded points in a different app - DID NOT receive points even after submitting a support ticket. So it was a waste of time for me",
        "It takes to long to cook somethings it don't even take 6hrs to make cookies in real life. The strawberries 2 at a time an 17hrs to grow come on get serious. It's never other ways to get strawberries u have to buy the coin alot in order to get most things which wldnt be a big deal if u wld make things more practical like the time it takes to make food an grow fruit especially the strawberries. Two many ppl order stuff requiring strawberries so they sitting there 2 an 3 days for there order wld not happen in real life. Fix the time it takes to cook an grow food.",
        "Its a good game sorry far I'm only level 11 but the gameplay is good. Only thing I would have to complain about is the lack of excitement in the food yeah it's different but to much stuff to get with so little goodies",
        "A good game, however it would be better if you could earn cash more easily and quickly rather than having to spend real money constantly, it will put me off eventually",
        "So you want to be a chef? Well you picked the wrong game. Might want to try either World Chef or Country Cooking. Either one is better then this piece of garbage. REPLY 3-2-2018 The afore mentioned games don't have any ads (except watch a video). Therefore they are way better in that aspect alone. Get rid of the ads and I'll give more stars. A \"classy 5 star restaurant\" doesn't need ads. So that makes me think this game has NO class or programmers are greedy or both. REPLY 3-5-2018 I did contact in game support and they basically  said: \"So sad, to bad, we don't care.\" So again that makes me think the makers of this piece of trash are just  a bunch of greedy people. If you respond to this quit giving me canned responses.."

        "Surprisingly deep experience. I suppose the obvious comparison would be to Soccer Spirits. This is a lot more grounded in reality (there's a lot less talking rabbits and little girls who can do magic), but there's more to do. There's also a dry cleverness permeating everything.  UPDATE: I've hit a weird and frustrating wall--the game isn't clear about when its days roll over. I guess it might be UTC (there are several indications that the game originates in the UK), but for a few days, my daily quests were rolling over at midnight Pacific Time (like most of these games that punish players for not playing every day), but today I noticed that there doesn't seem to be ANY consistency regarding when daily quests begin and end. Anyway, I'm docking two stars (I otherwise believe that this is a five-star game) until the game's daily rollover time is clarified. I had a nice streak going, that the game's failure to communicate ruined.",

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Great game thanks. as smooth as we like it well-done. To google players if you are  looking for action GTA 5 style then this is the game for you. I can't wait to get home from work every night make a brew and chill on this till I run out of battery lol class A game. (Again thank you for making this game) can't wait for updates fingers crossed",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks"

So I downloaded this one at first I didn't like it little confusing but now I love it the only thing that I recommended being able to find out what is power of means at any given time meaning I can go back days from now to find out what that power up mean otherwise I would recommend this game to anyone",
        "I hate games that say. Free. Then to advance you mustI pay  Or log into Fb.  I would just log on and find games, so far I can advance without paying maybe watch an ad. I have a similar game and you just watch ads for coins. If u like paying, then this is a good one. You can play once in a while. I guess. Good game. I would pay for the game itself, but not for a level. Make a pay game then allow a choice. FB making money. Iove it nonetheless. I play on, and it has gotten better.ü§ó",
        "Great game enjoyed on iPad.  Glad you made it for Android.  Would give all Stars if only for one glitch so far! Can't change profile picture or display name gives error code invalid username.  Wish it would be able to remember my level and placement weather I'm using WiFi or not! right now if WiFi not turned on it woodcut give current stats.  Please fix!",
        "Love this game. Challenging but also a lot of fun. This h as become one of my favorite games. What I really am getting hooked on are the daily challenges. The boosters are the \"bomb\"! This has become my go to game. And I will  add harder as you  progress. Still hooked! Level 234 and still can't get enough! I love it but it's getting really difficult. But still hooked! Still playing. Love the tourneys! Now at level 370 plus and still going!!",
        "Very addictive & fun. I've been playing for about 3 months & having fun with it.  It's so addicting, I don't even want to put the phone down. **Well, I'm still playing, even though I did take about a 3 month break from the game, but I missed playing it...so here I am. You know, you just need a break every once-in-a-while. I'm rambling now, but all-in-all this app is a great way to pass the time & have fun while you're doing it.",
        "Fun Fun & More Fun...Great  Game  Learning more about the game daily. In addition it makes playing solitaire totally exciting. Very Unique & Fun Game & Good  Way To Pass Away Time. I Love This Game So Much I Play It Daily.Just Love This Game! The only complaint is that I don't always receive my bonus points wish I could get Them"

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

        "Where's the 720 potbucks?!  Liars.  Pot farm brought me here.  Need more sexy babes.  A first person shooter mode too, like halo 1 online. Just nother point n click, like bleach online mmorpg.  The game that has all sexy babes no dudes, and the chicks beat dudes and practice femdom, we probably get the highest ratings and be the most popular lol.",
        "This is not the game i watched a video for. I would like to play that game (if it exists) but the link brought me this steamer. I'm sure your well aware of this as you've had plenty of reviews saying as much so its obvious to me you dont care. Great way to build a loyal customer base",
        "The game was fun for a little while, but it becomes quite monotonous. The game isn't interactive enough to keep you coming back for more. You more or less just watch your heroes battle which takes a lot of possible fun out of the game right away. If you spend any cash at all on the game, you unlock the ability to \"raid\" your already completed missions. So then when you need items, you will just mash the raid button until your energy is gone. And the energy recharges VERY slowly. You can play for free, but will progress substantially slower than the pay-to-play player. So overall, it's fun for a short while (a week or two), but you will quickly grow tired of it due to poor interactivity. If you are looking for a game similar to this that will keep your interest and has much more to offer, I would recommend Summoners War.",
        "Game apparently 'malfunctioned' and the heroic chest kept saying open free.  This was after I spent $25 US dollars so of course I thought why wouldn't I get some free opens?  I didn't know they were charging me 200 emeralds a pop.  Customer service was NO help.  Hopefully I can get a refund from Google Play.  Don't download!  Bad programming, scam in game purchases!",

        "Was more enjoyable to play before the update. Before I could move items I bought now everything I buy ends up in upper left corner. Cannot really even see each item. I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "Only wasted my time for a few levels then got rid of this pretty quick! Why waste your time completing levels, earning coins to buy stuff to decorate  when whatever you buy just gets a ll plopped down in one spot and cannot be moved. That's NOT decorating!!!! Fix that and I may be back.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average.",
        "This game bites. In the middle of game it freezes up or just returns to the start screen,if you can't fix this problem I'm uninstalling."

        "The game has bugged out now the hero's that did the time challenges are stuck I cant get them back.  I think it happend when the anniversary update hit and I put them in a time challenges during the time.  When I prestige and go to the time challenges it goes straight back to the main menu. And when i do have hero's  in the adventure mode it cuts to them when I pick the time challenges.  Please fix this.  And also happy anniversary üòÄ   Problem was fixed thank you very much!üòä",

That being said even tho this game uses ads for it's reward system it's actually quite pleasant, at no point did it become ridiculous or over the top. I really do appreciate how much of a back seat it it feels like the adds are taking to gameplay.",
        "Almost A Hero is an incredibly fun game with lots of interesting heros to use to battle near endless hordes of baddies. I find myself loading up the game multiple times a day to grab the free chest as well as to push through another couple waves before my next prestige. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this genre!",
        "Update: Ads are broken. I watched almost any that were presented to me in order to get farther faster but now they literally always load up a few seconds, then the game like restarts and I get jack from it. Dudes! Please fix, I am so very rarely addicted to a game like I am/was with this!!  Literally the best clicker/idle game I've ever played. I was glued to my phone for all of my free time five days straight because new and awesome stuff kept getting unlocked."

Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data..",
        "This game is awesome and addictive. My second First Person Shooter Game After Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation.  I only wish the Game Developers can bring back the game control we had in Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation; especially in terms of the gun control, and also create an offline PvP mode using Hotspot and Wi-Fi to connect players. Putting these two features in place will make this game undisputed First Person Shooter Game Ever.  In the near future, we should be considering how one can make real cash while playing online games like this."

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again‚úå",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. üî¶"

        "Improved in many ways, but you'll most likely need platinum turtles to earn Super Shredder DNA.  He is faster than a level 71 Splinter and he cheats. He uses all abilities with 0 cool down time, he keeps getting armor, shield, and healing... making winning impossible, unless you are +20 levels higher than him.",
        "It's a fun, easy, addictive game. My ONLY complaint is that even when you buy a card, you don't get to CHOOSE which Character you are getting. If I'm paying $100 for something, I better get to PICK what I'm getting - this game doesn't let you do that.  I also think it takes WAY TOO LONG to evolve Characters, and overall the add-ons are FAR TOO EXPENSIVE for what you are getting, but you don't HAVE TO spend money if you don't want to.",
        "The game is a great game, I love how they added characters from all eras, it sorta reminds me of turtles in time. The only huge downfall of this game is that it's pretty much a pay to play game smh. I've never seen a game that is so money hungry in my life. The $10 monthly subscription  is absurd, the SFX ingame dont work and for 5 bucks more you can play Elder scrolls online that has a ton of content compare to this game.",
        "Subscription should come with better benefits. $10 a month...6 months worth I could've bought an xbox game. Ya know. Pizza re-gen should be a bit quicker. Some people like to grind. And the pizza limitation kills the grind. Good graphics tho, and great characters. But waaaay to hard to acquire the turtles. Big let down on that aspect",
        "Great game just wished Very amazing game especially if you are a turtles fan.. lots of choices with characters.. you can definitely get stronger without having to pay.. you just need to put in the time , and do  do daily event's.. i wish some characters were easier to get;))",
        "After a long battle with the worst customer service i have ever dealt with i will regrettably no longer be playing this game. The game itself is pretty solid but is a money sink. If you need help from the company you may as well quit. The game is a solid 4/5 but the company's attitude and considering you being disposable sadly makes them a 1/10"

But you're making real money from us watching  the ad. Mmmmmmmm....",

        "Used to be fun but now all about $$$ I have been playing  this game for a long time and it has been one of my favorite games, but recently playmage has been more concerned about money and is ruining  the game. We used to be able to purchase potions in guild shop for reasonable  amount but that has changed because the game administration wants more money. This makes me sad because many long time players are leaving  the game. New players will never know just how fun this game once was. :-(",
        "Can't turn the crappy music off. You can only turn it down but you can still hear the horrible stuff. I couldn't stand it long enough to even figure out how to play the game. Uninstalling.",
        "Garbage. Played the game for 3 years, used to be one of my favorites. Then it turned into a cash-sucking piece of crap overnight with one update. I have never felt betrayed by a game developer prior to this, but Playmage introduced me to the feeling, and it's a strong hatred. I will never deal with them again. Avoid.",
        "Great game If you persevere you can great cards without spending lots of cash, good combo of skill and luck. Is disappointing they doubled price on revives and energy.",
        "This game was fun and now over time the game is slow and with no changes in sight.  What ever you do don't spend your $$ you gain nothing but pain for you because you got nothing to show for it.",
        "This game is joke pay real money for cards then they nerf them... and they weren't cheap! Don't waste your time or money!!!"

        "Not a bad game, don't need money really to level up and get to a good standing against others. It goes pretty quick till level 65ish  and starts to slow down. If you want to spend money it helps speed leveling and getting your guys up stronger faster obviously. If you have patience and don't mind not leveling to fast, or just taking your time in general this game is for you. Lots to do. My favorite part is trying to find a way to make my team the strongest I can, using the massively different combos of hero's u can use and all the things you can add to them to make them stronger. You can literally go with a 1 man team or a 5 man team based on materials u have to equip them with to make sure they can last in battle. Have fun and good luck all... Been playing for 100 days now, game is getting better players  wise, support  wise not so hot.. they only get back to you when they feel like it I guess, there was a problem I had like a month ago they kinda jumped on right away. But I messaged them a few days ago and they have yet to reply... Gonna drop the stars due to this. Love the game tho, be better to your players developers..",

It is silly to invest an hour into exploring only to lose it all because of an extra click, especially when you have a bunch of telaports. When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",

        "More and more focus on pay to win and the 4th weapon, the distance weapon makes it too complex and disturbing. In particular the boomerangs because there are almost no chances to avoid a hit. In unequal battles the inferior just got an extra disadvantage --&gt; no David vs goliath anymore possible. It sucks",
        "This is the worst chapter or update in  the game.. when I saw notification of the update I was very excited but when I opened this game the main quest was insane difficulty so I started side quest which was easy difficulty, but it was not for me it was easy for the enemy.. I played that more than 10 times but I didn't win 2 rounds so I just came here and wrote this review... And if you think I'm a noob.. then yes I am but only in this chapter not in previous ones..",
        "At first look it didn't mesmerise me, but after 2-3 matches I feel in love with it! It is awesome and has tons of weapons and other stuffs. The multiplayer option is also great and chest opening is such a treat. One worry is that the weapon below the primary weapon is still locked (why I don't know), otherwise the game is superb. Graphics are top notch and fighting doesn't come more realistic than that!",
        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "After the latest update, in side quest - wasteland I won twice both the times the game hung up but when the opponent wins it moves through to next easily. I can attach the screen shot of wanted.. kindly fix this it's frustrating  Now for the third time this has happened gonna uninstall the game bye",
        "Good overall, although I have some gripes about the stunlocking when you're ragdolled on the ground and you can't recover. Also, at the fight with Xiang Tzu in the tournament, after I win the game blurs to blue as it is supposed to, but just stay there and doesn't show my rewards. When I restart the app the game then resets me to before I fought Xiang Tzu."

        "If you like flying WW2 era fighters then you'll love this game. Even for being a mobile game I am impressed with everything the game offers. The only thing I do not like is Android users,like myself, cannot fly the plane from the cockpit, hopefully that option will be available soon!",
        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

        "Good app but few glitches. One day I was playing against computer. It made a miraculous move of eating my pawn at a place where none of my pawn ever existed. Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on..",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "The last update sucks! Premove is not at all intuitive. It now just shows the block which we want to move the pawn and doesn't move the pawn itself like before. The toast message that showed 'challenge rejected' was better than the current one. Dislike it!!",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team."

Awesomeüòí Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",

        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game."

        "This has a lot of potential. Connection issues are horrendous after this last update. Also, add a help section that explains what everything means. Lots of stats, numbers, ratings, etc. that we have to figure out on our own. Another thing, stopped receiving notifications after updating to Oreo.",
        "Overall it's pretty fun and addicting.  My only real issue came up with today's update. My 40-rated team got matched to play against a 60-rated team in my first Challenge game. wut",
        "The game was great until the update. Took my team from a 43 to a 41. Put alot of time into it, hope this gets worked out. They also nerfed training. Don't even bother wasting 15 coins on an extra session.",
        "Update: ***500 coins for ~350k in game cash isnt even 1 rookie signing.... you can get 3 star players for that kind of coin. **** the latest updates have added cool new features like the coach analysis, fewer bugs and more consistency. The coach analysis function could be cool but every description is \"this player is making great progress, keep pushing him!\" Even for aging players who are getting worse as the seasons progress. It does however project where the player could trend stats wise.  Still no goalie stats. Still no trade options (not sure how that would wotk) but they added refunds to contracts you release from your roster which depend on the player and their contract value,  time remaining etc...  Would be cool to also be able to make in game adjustments, like if your star goalie is letting goal after goal slip through swapping goal tenders would be nice otherwise there doesn't really seem to be a point in having 2 goalies even on the roster.  Overall it's a Fun game with a LOT of potential, if you're a fan of hockey you should definitely give this a try. Would like to see some of these things as the game develops",
        "Please fix how it automatically signs a new player if you don't renew a contract.. the purpose is to dump cap space and it signs some random player and then won't let me release him.  Also STOP changing my line ups. At any point any time ever. There's no need to change it or else you night as well play the game for me. I spend alot of time re doing them and then next thing I know every thing is changed. Not sure why or what causes it buy it is annoying as hell",
        "Overall it is a decent game. However finding an opponent for the games especially the rank games sucks. Either you get another player who is far superior to you or another who is far below your level. It needs to be more equal to be fun."

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. üëç"

        "i bought this game on my samsung galaxy s4 octa core version and it looks more of lagplay and not gameplay. this is dejecting as rockstar games has failed to optimise this game for android devices. it is recommended that they make necessary improvements and make the game playable for medium to high end devices. i have 4gb internal storage out of 16gb free yet the game lags, even on low settings like 0% resolution and draw distance .",
        "This game is so old school and gta 5 is so much better than this game but it is still worth playing. It has a lot of cheats and hacks but it is still very good. It plays up very x1000000 rare. This game is very fun and if you have seen my comment please download this game immediately because it's extremely fun and it is very easy to collect money ps its okay to play offline and if you have seen my comment i recommend you to download this game immediately and have a great time",
        "I loved this game wh3n I was young and this brings back the best memories of my child hood haha.. the controls are kinda lumpy when steering a vehicle. But all other movements are pretty good. Butt,if you happen to have a Xbox one s controller it works perfect on my galaxy s8 plus. Thanks for porting this game to android and giving the option to max the graphics out. Looks very good! Loving the portal game feel too haha!",
        "Just started, i am playing with an Xbox One controller and everything works perfect.  The only problem is you are stuck with the original controls and cant change the buttons functions.  I wish i could use the triggers for gas and braking for driving the cars like in GTA's 4 and 5.  Other than that everything is good.  A classic game, that runs smoothly, and is a great time nostalgia trip.   This one works so well that i am definitley buying the other ports as soon as i am done with this one.",
        "Game could be grate Game looks awesome but the controls don't work right. Walking and running is not fluid. It's stop and go. While driving it is very hard to steer while pressing the gas pedal. I have Max Payne and the controls in that are great what happened with GTA San Andreas. Please fix. Also could you make it so I can move the game to my SD Card. I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 4.",
        "Guys help please! i gave the game 5 stars because i like it so much. But there's a probleme that im facing now when changed devices i had all my data saved on a samsung alpha device, now i reinstalled the game on my new samsung s6 edge and i loged in, and there was no cloud save. Please help me find a way to fix this! Thank you"

When swiping it doesn't always read the swipe and kick it for a try through ball. When shooting the swipe isn't constant, I can swipe as fast as i can and it goes 54mph. Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue.

You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",

When I win a game and crashes its actually a lost, keep doing the bad job, and in a few weeks time I'll be quiting and rating this as 1.",

        "It's fun, but I can't play it once I get to the mist part in section 1-2, the game freezes but the music keeps playing... If the devs make an update that fixes this, I'll play, but until then, since I can't play it properly, it's off my phone. Sorry devs, it's amazing but I can't play it right now",

        "Can you pls put in a feature to migrate the data from Line Cookie Run? Line Cookie Run is closing down soon but I have so much memories collecting my cookies and treasures and I already had so much! To lose everything is making me a little heartbroken :'(",

        "I'm a bit reluctant at first trying this new CookieRun from the previous LINE version, but I regret it, I should have play this sooner. Everything is so addicting with new system and better music and graphics as well, awesome!"

It would be nice if the writing matched the excellent quality of artwork on the game.",

The graphics are amazing no flaws there and as a new player right now the newcomer rewards are so helpful.",

        "Sorry to say, but in terms of balance it is the worst game I have played so far. This game is the most unbalanced game, even for beginners. Currently I have 4 heroes and the funny part is that all four are weak against defense, such as a cannon, a rail gun, 2 stars for the full upgrade. Even high level players can attack on beginners. Defence is too much high for the attacking players, against 2 heros unit and I've noticed that lower level players can not overcome my defence while high-level players pass easily. This game is good and entertaining, there is not much flaw in this game, but this game is very unbalanced and unfair. Many players have complained about this.",

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "Not really an action game app. If you like Mafia Wars than this is perfect for you.   UPDATE: Downtown Wars is by far not a bad game. The question is it a game for you. The animation is very limited so if you enjoy action then this is not a game for you. The best way to describe what I noticed after playing game for nearly a week, that it is a long level up game of tag. The comment board is one of the best aspects because you can communicate with the community most important you gang/mob members which helps for team building.",
        "Very interesting and a nice game to pass time, love the BGM! Really like the changeable tags, it's so convenient to change it according to our mood/status and the profile erase option without losing the mob WOW! A really big thumps up to that! It also kinda reminds me of Mob Wars and Extreme Mob Wars etc which got me feeling nostalgic because I was really into it but, DTM tops it all! ;) Forgot to mention this, we can put space in our name! That's so convenient! Cool!",
        "I think Elites should be boosted atleast 100 Points - 20 billion then 1000 Points - 40 Billion is 10x the work for 2x the reward.  A huge change could be game breaking but raising it to 80 Billion would give new players a chance against older players that give their minis huge collects every tourney.",
        "Very good game but it could be better. Like when uv got multiple invites u should be able to accept them all in one instead of one at a time. But that's my only gripe. Apart from that it's a brilliant game much better than the dead imobsters. 1 more thing where can we find the boss iron fist who's attacked me a couple of times but I can't find him to attack him back. How can you recover ur account when uv forgot Google account details.",
        "For me with all the rejuvenation down time, I get bored. But when the favors work,  it becomes a really fun game to keep your mind busy.  But by having multiple games like this it's Kool to toggle  between them. The graphics are great.   My Love for this game comes from the interactive game plot. You have to build networks with fellow gamers to rank.  And likewise building enemies.",
        "Great game. I have played this game for years. It just continues to get better.  Recently in last 24 hours my phone crashed and I got it back up and running. But only when I open this game. Does it say UNABLE TO REACH SERVER. I don't know what's wrong. It won't let me open game at all. Plz fix for me"

        "I really love this game, you get rewarded for prioritizing property and it's very satisfying to finish the level with a perfect score when you time everything just right. The diamonds are a little bit too rare to get and since half the updates are priced with diamonds the end result is each location doesn't get 100% upgraded, witch is a little bit frustrating. I love that when you revisit a level it's slightly different, makes it much more interesting. It's a lovely little game, kudos to the developers and designers!",
        "1. This should have an UNLIMITED LIVES option. The stages per level are unenjoyably difficult enough --why do you have to limit the player's chance to try and be better?? Some levels are impossible for human fingers already.  2. You should lessen the required number of diamonds as value of items to upgrade!!! A player only gets 9 diamonds per level achieved. 10 gems per upgrade is ok, but 50??? FIX THIS ASAP or people will be deleting this app.",
        "I love it cuz it's the best but some of the costumers are feisty. The old lady takes three the man and boy takes two things. The young lady is fine. She takes 1 stuff. The little girl I hate her. She rides her scooter in the shop when she know full well she post to ride her scooter outside. But everything else is okay.",
        "I always love supermarket mania. I played supermarket mania 1 and 2 and expect great things for this. But, no, this game infuriates me. The pace is really slow and the customer stream is to long. More over, it use diamonds for essential upgrades like cashier (why should i upgrade cashier??) and cart. Grinding diamonds is a pain in the ass. I think the developer only think of making money than make this game enjoyable to it's player.",
        "I like this game but it needs to give better options earn Crystal's and it should not cost you as many if any at all to move to next level. I play a lot of games and don't mind spending a few dollars but now I'm turned off from it. Yall need to do better. I Won't suggest it to any of my friends for that reason alone.",
        "I really have fun with this game. I also like how you can earn the crystals through playing, not absolutely having to pay. One thing that would be nice was to have the option to fast forward especially with times when you're just waiting for customers or the elderly ladies to finish shopping. Also an endless challenging round would be awesome. Thanks =)"

        "Enjoyed the game. Very fun and im actually spending which is rare for me.   I dont like the orb prices go up with each new arena. I wont be spending now im in in arena 4 those prices are just not worth it. Id also like the ability to save a few different decks. And make gold earning a bit easier its not balanced. Im in arena 4 and been saving gold for over a week not spending on anything opening orbs. And i still cant upgrade any of my cards.   Tbh as much as i enjoy the game. If i cant upgrade without spendig then ill wind up uninstalling eventually",
        "Love it! Very interesting and fun to play, but i have a suggestion. You should add some spells (Poison, Heal...). They don't have to be overpowered, just for slightly more fun gameplay! Also they should be regular cards (Heroes). And one more thing: bring some advatage to players that don't start first in the match, because it's easier to win when you are playing first.",
        "Very unique and fun strategy game. Easy to understand from the first game. Very forgiving to newcomers but if you want to get good, it takes planning and learning. Fun to pick up and play throughout the day. My only problem is that if you sit and play for more than a few minutes, you'll waste alot of orbs winning games. You can spend gems to free up slots, but I'd rather just not receive orbs until I have a free slot. Good game.",
        "I wish that your global rank was more intuitive and less complicated to acquire. Also on the achievement's it says that I can't get the last 2 stars on the found heroes however I have all that I can get. I also wish there was a pm option as the leader of a clan I want to give constructive criticism but not call them out in the chat.. other than that it fully deserved the 5 star.. thanks for makeing this and keep smashing!!üòã",
        "The game itself its good, but lack of fun. To upgrade cards you need money which is hard to get in the game and from the clan. In free chest and common orbs you never get any rare cards and money is too less. Would be fun if the cards could be developed faster and if they would have a counter attack possibility when you upgrade it to certain level. You could implement a coop when each plyer choose 2 cards from deck or something similar. In addition I would change which player starts, should be based on the deck strenght. I would also implement the position of the cards on the field and which card is in front and which card in the back, by that you need to start a bit more strategic. Hope that something happens with the gameplay soon, before more players leave. Good luck",
        "Love the game. Really fun to play and balanced so even non paying players can do well. One complaint I have is the new addition of zombie has a bug, when hitting a buffed opponent the poison touch doesnt replace the buff. Please fix this issue."

        "Great game!!! Still some bug's. You have to log out and log back in to collect the 5 hour daily rewards. Sometimes you can't post in the chat rooms. It will say invalid character. A lot of lag at times when you use the power and impact gauge. There needs to be more options to customize character's and or add more. I also believe the daily 5 hour rewards need to change instead of the same rewards everyday. It is a fun game, and highly addictive. Great graphics, which still could be improved on, looking at newer golf games coming out.",
        "Great game.  Only problem is the huge 10 second warning that covers your shot.   Also the game meter jumps.  So I get penalties for taking longer than 10 seconds when I let the control bar reset.",
        "Almost great. The UI is a crowded mess. Too much nonsense. The equipment tabs are broken due to bugs(I downloaded on several devices) making it impossible to accurately navigate between items, and the putting is rigged(obvious padding) resulting in missed shots that shouldn't happen. Besides these glaring flaws there is great potential here.",

Sick to death of my putts begging taken off me because you have ridiculously stupid gamer play.  If I putt a ball in real life and it hits the edge of a cup it goes in 90 pc of the time.  If I putt one to the lip of the cup in real life it goes ohm.  But bout your retarded physics.  They stop the ball on the edge or knock it away from the hole. What a load of bulls$/^.

That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",
        "Gave you people an opportunity to fix the stupid chibi icon characters. The latest update didn't fix that so uninstalled.  Also do not reply with a generic response cause you can kiss my ass",
        "Only challenging for nonpaying playing. Not a big fan of pay to win games. But LoA is always addicting and just makes you want to spend your money. Not suitable if you're addicted to that overall. More nonpaying support would be reasonable for them to at least be able to compete.",
        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",
        "I'm getting tired trying to make the in game download to download it keeps saying that it couldn't download it try a different line everytime I get to 18 or 17 please help me... It's not my network so don't say it's my network.. I tried restarting the game that only makes it worst I really want to play this game."

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¬§mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  üò¨ üò≤ üò† üòê üò≠  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "I'm a sports junkie so of course this game drew my attention. Wasn't sure about the gameplay at first, but I like this game enough to play everyday. I actually have some decent ideas for this game that could put it over the top. If the app developers actually read this review then you should contact me. I have ideas that would make this game have an even broader spectrum in the marketplace, reaching not only sports nuts like myself, but gamers in general.",
        "I like the plays, plus you can put it on auto and watch it if you get tired. Just one problem. Your Dev people need to look into this: I thought if the spinner landed in the bright green, your play would go the yards it was supposed to. If it landed in the dark green, your play would gain a few more yards. Now the bad stuff. If the spinner landed in the bright red, your play and your opponent's play would fail and if it landed in the dark red, the ball was either fumbled or intercepted, depending upon the play. That's what happens to me, but not to my opponent. Many times when the spinner goes to the red, between the 40 yard line and the goal line, he will spin, and the spinner landed in the red. He will get a touchdown. His play was supposed to fail.",
        "I love this game alot but it's getting annoying now. I had to restart bc I lost my other game but my team is about 80points good. I just lost to a team that has 40. I find that sad. My team is way better. Not the first time bc I've lost to a 40,46,50,63,75. Please make it harder for teams that are low beat a time higher then them. Make it more challenging for teams that are lower",
        "I like the game overall but the clock management is really bad. Like 40 seconds for a play? At least add timeouts or make the plays not waste so much time. Also yall should add playoffs for the season, not jus win win win and win. It should be more competitive in the season mode and not just winning cause it gets boring. That's what I suggest but overall the game is good . Pls reply and make a huge update . :)",
        "Are you kidding me. Blitz doesnt help against the run. It absolutly does. And you are seriously telling me that i cant make 10 passing plays in a row. I absolutly can in real life. So unrealistic.",
        "Other than you can't see a lot of the plays it's a really good game. But one thing .you guys should put more indept into the game by letting us see more plays .instead of only the plays that counts. I myself want to see indept plays. But other than that. It a great game"
