        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star",
        "Will change my review after connection issue is fixed. The most recent update made this game unplayable. I have played for over a year without issue but not now I cant update the game in app at all. It gets to the end of the update and hangs there then it gives me a download fail no matter what I do. ****Update**** It seemed to download today but I have lost over 3 days of logins which sucks. Looking at the bright side though I can play again ^_^."

Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "Fun way to pass time and super addictive but most of the levels are insanely hard. Some can only be completed if you're lucky enough to get the bonus items in the right place. Also the safe box is getting on my nerves. I thought it was a limited time offer and would go away but it's been there for 2 weeks now!",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Curious to see if they manage to respond properly this time",
        "I have been playing this for 1.5 years. I love everything about this game. They always have fun events - usually 2-3 events occur at the same time. You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",
        "I love this game! I play at every opportunity I get. Thanks for helping me set up the game on my tablet. I have however, run into another issue I hope you can help me resolve. I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",

        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "Well I like the game. It's fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don't open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.",
        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖"

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I love this game, it makes walks more interesting and makes walking different routes worth it BUT my progression has all but halted. I live in a quite neighbourhood with limited players which is not the issue, raids are the issue. I can't get even one other player to raid with in my area so now the game is basically over for me as I can't 'catch em all'. I'm likely to quit if solo players don't get the same chances as groups because I have no choice but to play solo...",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "Overall it improved so so much since it was realased but I still don't like one aspect about Pokémon GO. You can't have parties with your friends and go out hunting the fun factor would go through the roof if you could play with your friends and go find some Pokémon. I still do like the game it encourages you to walk and all but if you could see your friends avatar and their Pokémon that would be great. Also when you catch the Pokémon the animation is a bit too long. And it would be cool if there was a small minimap when you catch the Pokémon. Waypoints would also be much appreciated and it would be such a great feature. I honestly think the game is a bit lacking right now but I hope it will still be improved. Cheers"

        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "I 'my semi-hooked in it.  It's fun and challenging .  The characters are amusing, especially Austin.  I  do, however,  feel the games are  set up so that there are times when  it is impossible to win.  Games need to be winnable.   Some should be just be harder to win especially when  money  can be  involved.  Still, I  like it.",
        "Game is awesome... sometimes it takes days to get past one level which is dumb.... wish I could move ahead in the game faster... would make it more enjoyable."

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",
        "good way to teach us to be patient should we prefer to play freely.   Occasionally error.  KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "entertains well. but plz try to improve the swiping feature ncz when we want to play the first or second episode ,have to swipe all over down n got fed up with that, its taking too much time to do so. its really urgent to improve that thing.",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",
        "Very disappointed in this app over the last several months.  Every time I go into app to play game I get kicked out.  It is not always immediate which is very frustrating because I will loose lives etc UN-necessarily."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I absolutely adore this app for it's witty, adorable characters and simple yet infinite concepts. I'm addicted! I have one issue, though. The limits on the barn and silo, frankly suck. I have eleven duct tapes but no screws so I had to pay diamonds I didn't want to spend so I could have a little flexiblility! Please fix this.",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan"

        "On level 2185, had over 800 different boosters and suddenly all of them are gone, serious glitch in game... emailed their tech center for over 1 week now and only get a automated response and nothing from a real person. Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

I have seen this group cheat repeatedly without any penalties. Also seems odd that this game crashes when you are trying to shield up. Allowing others to attack you. Don't recommend this game to anyone.",

        "This WAS my favorite game and was happy to spend a small amount of money to make my team competitive. If you are a new player DON'T download this game unless you plan to spend thousands of real money you are too far behind to compete. It now takes about 15 million in game currency to max out a character with all it needs. you will only make about 8 million a week if you complete every task and join a good team. So basically 2 weeks per character and you need a minimum of 5 maxed characters to make a dent",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info."

        "This game keeps crashing to the home screen without warning,same problem with Blossom blast saga.Problem started before few days ago,since I updated both games.This problem keeps happening with android kitkat. Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "At level 558 I quit this game like 2=3 years ago... Now I don't even remember how to defeat spiders etc... Thought it would be fun to start over from scratch... But of course in these games not even a chance...  Great fun... NO",
        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",

Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "It's bloody fantastic I haven't played it for years but the game flows better than it first came out keep up the good work 👍",
        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "CPU for army is dumb especially the player's defensive army.  Edit: I've only just found this but I would like to add this: remove the friend request max!! It is hard for new players to gain the no. of friends achievement if there is a maximum number of friend requests you can make as most of the older players will have used them and the newer ones cannot get the final level of that achievement on their own. So please remove it. Plus the guild treasury needs more of a purpose then just guild v guild. I have lost almost 1000 goods to the guild treasury for quests as i do not do guild v guild nor am I interested in participating in guild v guild. So please add a function were you can remove goods that you have placed in the guild treasury (also handy for people making mistakes of putting one too many.",

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",

The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it.",

I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!",
        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "Scam company that's only interested in taking your money. Events are rigged and if you ask them for probabilities or odds on winning a particular hero they fob you off with \"it's all random, and you need good luck\".....avoid spending any money on this app",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Absolutely love this game! Been playing forever, this game never gets boring. It's completely free, you just have to be patient and cautious with your materials. Amazing for a free to play app 😍😍",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

        "Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you're willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜"

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "Love this game addictive and lose time playing it. But anyone else having problems logging in? When i try to log in it just sits on the loading screen (on 100%).. Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "I enjoy the game, but i can't grasp the fact you can't sell items you don't need or will use. I also think we should not have to pay to add sims to household.  Also,  i enjoy the regular theory of becoming pregnant and watching the belly grow. Feast time killer. But once these changes are made if so,  I'll start playing more. Until then the xbox game of sims will do",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio."

        "This season I really put in a big effort to try and win the treble. Got the best players, do all the training, strategy ect. All for nothing. Lost against a crappy team in semi of Cup. Apparently according to IA it wasn't my day. Like I said before, game is pre programmed. Dev's do nothing about the gameplay, they rather concentrate on silly add ons which can make them money. Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is 👌 I love it",
        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAİN that SYSTEM DİVİSİON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER DİVİSİON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "Good game, crashes a lot, players prices are very expensive  (tokens). for some reason i can't trade players with my friends and i'm a level 5 Manager already. apart from that, nice game...!!?",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs"

AND THEN WHEN THE NEW UPDATE COMES OUT.... I LOSE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you PLEASE give me the stuff back.",
        "This is my favorite game.I have played it since I was in P1 but the only things that I want Rilisoft to make are a 4th campaign world cause I have been waiting for almost 4 years and that you can give your friends weapons.But still great and memorable game so well done Rilisoft",
        "I like this game a lot. I don't know if I were think too much but I feel like Everytime I level up, the weapon that I use before was unexpectedly weaker.Lucky chest seem to drop only coins and crysrals(sometimes I got free spin). And some modes, weapons and armor balance is not really that balance (example:last match I used smart bullet bazooka to kill people using 4 rockets to kill them. But he killed me with only 2 rockets of smart bullet bazooka...... How is that even balance?!). I hope you fix this soon. Because I love to play game.",

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

        "My first played MOBA. This is excellent game and there's nothing could beat this game. Otherwise, please make improvement like losing stars cause of that AFK player. Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

Also PVP is very buggy as I am always seeing waiting for opponent or opponent is viewing last match which isn't an option. Just wondering if there is a security team that monitors online activity because it seems like a lot of people are manipulating the network at times.",
        "I like the game but last week 2 of my cards where removed I didn't accidentally delete them. They was locked. I emailed and got told that there was nothing they can do. It is a Titan pro Neville and a beast pro Tamina can someone help me get my cards back I played a lot of games to pro them right",
        "Horrible, disgusting excuse for customer service I have ever seen. Automated response no matter the issue. Never a problem ( and there are many many many issues.) Do not let the WWE license fool you, this is NOT a company I would support and I'm not sure why WWE can't find another company to produce a game.like this.",
        "They are still plagued by PVP issues that they claim they are fixing, but never do anything about. Not worth playing as you won't actually recieve your rewards for playing, and they won't help you if you send in a help ticket. You will only get form letter responses. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "I was expecting this to come out soon, after all another build a medieval city clone. Nothing original about it. I play it only because of GOT theme. How to keep people playing? -Don't make the screen so congested. -Make stuff like buying a second builder permanent, not for 2 days.  -Basically don't make it P2W. If you don't get what I mean look up how EA messed up with Starwars Battlefront 2",
        "Alliances are complicated but use the chat feature and folk will tell you or PM you. It does take up a bit of time..IF YOU LET IT, but overall, not a bad game. Loads to do...follow what tyrion tells you. Wish I could find particular resources for crafting or I'm never gonna have a level 10 helmet haha. Have fun...don't let it rule your life",
        "Real truth! This game is built on your discourage to upgrade without buying. You can increase your castle but you have to spend real money all the time. Their rewards vs investment is 10% for you. You will spend your whole credit on this and still not be eligeable for the iron Throne. This is WB best scammed game out there! Things you 400 of to upgrade, only come as 6 units or less a month which pushes you to buy 100$ packages to upgrade. WB is laughting at you!",
        "12 days is an unacceptable amount of time to respond to a paying customer's problem. Is this the only way to get attention of WB? I have submitted ticket 5 times with no answer!",
        "Unless you completely have no life and plan to spend every waking second playing this i do not suggest it. I downloaded it to have to kill time but unless you spend plenty of money on it and are willing to dedicate majority of your day, you will probably be bullied and attacked by the ones who have no life and spend tons of money on it.",
        "Too expensive. The in-app purchases cost about 5-100 €. Those players who pay that on a regular basis dominate and win the game. Those players who don't are currently about 50 times smaller. It is like fighting off tanks and stealth bombers with flintstone and spears. You will lose."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Devs don't listen, battle fields are very imbalanced and half dead really. It's really a pay to play game so be prepared for that. It could be fun if they would pay more attention to players and not so concerned with how to make you pay for the next thing.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor"

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

I'm playin a level w/ the Monklings, like 124/6 if u watch closely if u catch a long, 6,7,8, row on Monklings KING WILL NOT ALLOW U TO HAVE THE WHOLE row. Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

        "Love this little game! I wish we had five life's, Three just gets me started. But overall, it's a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don't make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!",
        "Very hard and not as fun as the other games but  because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I've noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level. The most amazing part of this game are the graphics.  Awesome really awesome.  Very well done. Still playing this game but also still cannot convince my friends to get out of CC and other games. Will keep on trying though.",
        "This game is set up to STEAL a certain number of lives before you can win a level. Some levels, like Venice, level 79 may never be won. I have bought extra lives twice, extra moves twice, I REFUSE to make anymore purchases. If this was a truly user friendly game, it would BANK any extra moves, lighting, and other bonuses you've earned but did not use. But no, it throws them out. STEALS what you have earned. BANK it for me, I earned it, I should get to keep it. I'm done with this game.",
        "I am glad for the staff at big fish they did a wonderful job getting me back play after all my levels where lost.. They found them all and it made me happy that i can play where i was.. I can not play to often sometimes and had taken me a long time but look forward to every new city i get to open a new and all the challenges i get to participate in.  Thank you all for this game",
        "Fantastic game!  I love the graphics and interesting bits of trivia shared every time a landmark is built.  I also like the extra daily challenges and the special events that open up every so often.  Gummy Drop is challenging but can be played without needing to make any in-app purchases.  One con: the game starts you with three lives (lives replenish after 20 minutes), but in order to permanently increase your lives to five, you must pay $10.",
        "Surprisingly fun! I was setting the ads for this game everywhere but thought they were really unappealing. Work on your ads a little to emphasize the fun prizes for completing levels, the enjoyable hunt for tour letters in old levels, the history of the buildings you save! So many great things happening in this game."

But there's an issue, Roblox pleaseeeee fix the lag and add more available controls for mobile pocket edition is solo laggy and some gears to use are un available to use and not able to okay most of the games. The graphics are  really bad on mobile and you can't higher the graphics which is boring, but I still love this game its really fun.",
        "This game is AMAZING!!! Just fix a few glitches though. I play this game 24/7. I even get my tablet at bedtime and play on it. 1 last thing. Why did your moderators not get our reports and why can't we say simple words when we chat?",
        "It's a really great game but there are some flaws to it. First of the game is reall laggy for me and tends to always disconnect me in a game and I fell as if the reporting thing doesnt work either because they are never really blpcled for a while but those are tge only things but overall its an amazing game",
        "Garbage ot gives ur computer viruses. And games are limited on the phone or tablet people with out robux can't play bloxbrug so its not a goof game and people should be able to customize the character with out buying robux its just dumb",
        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",

If you dont want to spend real money then this game is not for you, you will get stuck on campaign like me and wont be able to upgrade your car for the next mission.",
        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "All round best racing game I have played so far! That said, the game becomes very difficult as one goes above REP 60. It becomes very time consuming to proceed in the game without spending actual money. Useful stuff becomes harder to obtain via docks and via older races, which is frustrating.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7"

        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game.I really do.It has brought me alot of joy. It's great fun and it's a guilty pleasure of mine. With that being said. Your Ranked Events are Not Excusable. I'm v7 so I have skin in the game as they say.. I will pass and when you stop your Ranked Events I will gladly change my review. No Excuse for a blantent cash grab you make a lot of money.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update",
        "its a nice game, but please rate the places lil bit low, it's hard to earn money, and when we save it for a place to buy, a raid takes place... increase the spin no. also atleast from 50 tp 60... it was fun at first.. but due to all this it's becoming boring.",
        "I'm honestly speechless at how simplistic this game is, but it so fun! It's so simple to play, everything about this game is just AWESOME! It's super addicting, a great time killer, eveeything is just great about this. I don't usually rate games but this one made me rate it, keep up the good work!"

        "Keeps locking up with a white screen and doesn't go to the spinner.  Also last few days the helpful hints had gone away.  They need to get rid of excellent flashing on screen.  You'll be in s timed level and you lose time because you can't see under the words.  Some levels its ridiculous to have to do them 15 times to pass it",
        "I think there is difference between hard to solve or impossible. To get diamonds in order you should be able to get them. As example. Need to get circle first then triangle. But you cant get triangle unless circle is moved first. And mission failed because you didnt get diamonds in order. This is repeats over and over again. This is impossible to solve. I even had to deal with triangle being right down at the bottom. And all other diamonds at the top. I failed of cause. I am giving my view because I fed up with this stupid idea.",
        "Game updated now havent a clue what i need on level 421 and objects i need are blank boxes can play game but dont know what i need if any one can tell me object amount and what levels they are on it would be a help. Also have uninstalled game a installed it again but still dosnt help.",
        "I really love this game. But expeditions are more fun then the game itself. I really wish we could actually finish the expeditions instead , of not getting to finish the story behind them. Also during the expeditions to buy things are way to expensive because the amount of maic it takes to remove one item. Pls address these issuea. Really hope to see some expeditions we can really have fun and finish with.",
        "I love the expedition part but not enough time to complete them. Also i cut one tree down and have to wait an hour to cut another. Its takes to much magic to clear paths.Its hard to build the bridges and stuff because of this. Other then that i have no problem with it.",
        "Love the different puzzle styles that go along with the basic mahjong matching game. It gives an extra challenge to completing each game. Sadly I have only gotten to 250 levels after a year or 2 of playing because the puzzles are constantly rigged to lose. I am not a cash player as I have more important living expenses to spend money on so buying power ups and such are not an option for me. Would be great if there weren't so many losing games one after the other. I'm referring to the ones where you get to the last couple of tiles and the gems needed are at the very bottom so you are made to match the 4th set of gems when you are supposed to match the 3rd set first. I get multiple games where the matching tiles are stacked on top of each other so it requires a shuffle to win. As I said I am not and refuse to cash shop on a game that is not worth spending money as it is not a necessity so it would be nice to be able to progress without 10-15 losing games in a row. The spinning wheel doesn't always have ads available and I rarely get power ups from it. I mainly get paws."

Would keep people playing more and they would have more purchases! That's how I'd rack in the bucks if it were my app!",
        "2ND UPDATE: 3/21/18- Thank you for adding new bathrooms and bathroom rugs! Thank you also for giving new, unique furniture on 5th or 7th consecutive days. Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",
        "I like this game but it's frustrating how it's hard to get stars and then they want you to waste them on things like giving the cat a bath... I want to decorate the house not do all the silly side things."

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info.

        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "Overall game is very good n addictive, been playing the game for awhile now. 1 major issue of the game is bugs that cause the game to lag esspecially after every game update. Reali hope Pocket Gems will look into this matter seriously and build a better game foundation. I will review my ratings when the game is more stable.",
        "LOVE THIS GAME!! unlike other timed games you don't have to wait around.  When things are upgrading you can literally spend hours if you want just attacking other bases and breeding dragons.  Graphics are amazing and this is one game that constantly has me coming back.",
        "Wonderful game, all these pay to win comments are slightly misleading. There are several power ups and time reducers that come fairly easy if you participate in events. Which, the events are almost always going on so you don't get bored!  Only problem I have is that the app keeps uninstalling itself from my phone. Not sure if it's the app's fault or my phone, but it doesn't happen to any other app on my phone...",
        "PG needs to fix a lot of stuff. They never listen to the community and with the Atlas update has destroyed many alliances by creating a class divide between teams of all ranks. Huge let down and am afraid of the future of the game when game design decisions like this are allowed to occur.",
        "Fun until you have to wait a day to do something. How can you play a game if the game won't let you play, but by good it takes up space. So you want me to have a game taking up space in my phone but I'm can't play the game. So it is literally a waste of space.. developers are stupid and selfish."

        "Everything was thought of. Very easy to learn the rules. And totally awesome to be able to start playing this game for real with. Out having. To spend money.. I will spend a little though to make a nice deck",
        "This is a very polished game. Everything is on point from graphics to game play. The meta game is very diverse with many decks being fun to play. I've come to really enjoy the speed duel format as it works great for mobile gaming. Having only 3 Monster spaces and spell/trap spaces makes you think about what you are using."

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The Sims keeps progressive challenges fun and interesting, and the Club Wars make for a very fun multiplayer experience!  The graphic attention to detail is amazing! It's quite relax just to watch the shadows of the skyline stretch as the sun crosses the sky or to see hot air balloons floating around the metropolis.  This game is lots of fun!!"

        "Sometimes I would give it a five star other times 4 star. Good number of challenge keys per visit to none challenge sites. As few as two visits needed for one visit to challenge site in final level of challenge (requiring 25keys). Love the two modes for cards of fate. No time limit but fewer tries works great if you write down what you find. It surprisingly has improved my timed play of this mini game. There are getting to be too many items and NO search functions to facilitate where to find a particular item, what collection items belong to if someone wants it and you don't want to send it anonymously (case if you send a requested item) and don't send it from the gift bar. One of the better hide and find games.",
        "I changed my previous rating. There are so many glitches, especially with new events  and support doesn't respond to requests. I haven't gotten totem bonuses for three days and new event is nearly impossible at times to find bunnies and objects. This used to be my \"go to\" stress reliever but now it just creates more stress.",
        "Instead of relaxing me this game stresses the hell out of me. New bunny location is extremely hard to find the 🐇. And the time limit is too short. I know im wasting my time writing this cause I've seen a lot people complaining about it and nothing is been done. Will be unistalling if it doesn't gets fix. Good day",
        "The main complaint is that some tasks have insanely short timers, like for the new event where you have to find optionnal stuff that's really well hidden as well as the usual pack of items that usually takes the whole timer to find. Great game, bases itself too much on money dropping.",
        "The only thing I don't like about the game is that by the time you search a couple of places (depending on ur level) is how long you have to wait to get enough energy up to search again. Depending on what you want to search it can take up to an hour or more to get the requirements. Other than that I really like the game."

        "Love the game. Definitly think 8ts rigged on tower of fortune for sure. Az for going through 3 different phones with the app i have actually had luck linking it with my fb never had an issue. It would be alot better if non active clan members could get kicked. Im trying to achieve the legendary chest which is impossible with maybe only 8 active people. Other than that its pretty addicting. I play every morning before work and every night before bed. Plenty of levels to keep busy!",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out."

        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

        "A wonderful survival game that Ive been enjoying nonstop for around a week. I personally have not experienced slow loading, and the rare items to find are fun for me, not too hard. The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",
        "This is not actually a review its more like tips for those who like to play the game. I started playing on December and I already have a chopper. I could easily build a second one. The alpha bunker is the best place to get parts. Try using the traveller and selecting 5% chance to find a car part before you open the treasure boxes. Keep the best weapons for the  bunker.  Spots that appear on the main map that have timers are the only places you will find your body incase you die out there. If this is helpful I will give more tips on clothings.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and addicting, with patience.  My only complaint is that everytime i die,  which is often,  i lose all my stuff and can never find my body again.  I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",
        "WARNING: every time you update the game, it cannot connect to your google play account for god knows how many hours or even days! The risk of losing all your progress is VERY high. If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",
        "I love the game. But seriously? You get 1 energy every 5 minutes and at minimum need 13 energy to get somewhere... Also why do you stop letting us watch ads? It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",
        "I'm done with this game... I have spent hours on it and despite being level 99 the game has stagnated. This latest update... Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game."

        "It's a good story and all. But I only wish they would let me save up energy or at least give me a little more. It gets frustrating when I can't Carry on, I'm not a patient person. Graphics are good. Controls are good. Story is great! Loving most of this game so far. I just hope they change the energy part of it. Though I guess it's a lot easier to read thn most episode stories.",
        "I love the story Line just like I've been reading in the comments the energy sucks I know it's just to keep us from reading the story so fast an to blow our money on, but if there was another way instead of us waiting for so long for just a little energy it's defently keeping me from downloading another game like this.. it takes so long to receive the 300 energy I done forgot an really not into the story Like I was when I 1st downloaded it.",
        "The story and art art great, like in the other game, and I love the music too.  I have 2 major complaints though: 1. It's not indicated anywhere in the appstore that this is a work in progress (there's currently 4 chapters in English). This particularly bothers me since I bought energy so I could get immersed in the story, only to be torn out of that immersion by an incomplete story. 2. The energy system. I mentioned this in my review for the Drogo one as well, and plenty of people pointed it out here so I won't go into detail.",
        "I think all of these Is it love stories are absolutely amazing. The writing has given me inspiration to read more romance novels. But I don't like the energy system. I foolishly paid a lot of money to read/play longer and I'm glad the author and developers get the money for a product I thoroughly enjoy. I just wish the daily energy was 1000 or something",
        "Amazing story... When will there be more chapters?! I also don't like how I have to buy energy in order to not just have five minutes (maybe) of reading the story and making decisions. Please come out with more chapters soon!",
        "Loving the story so far and the graphics.. It's all so beautiful. Only wish that they would give you more energy over time to read it.. when you lose time to read you lose interest in the story by the waiting. Help us stay interested!"

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring.",
        "After playing this game it's extremely pay to play. You never get notified if you get placed in a higher tier. There is very low rewards which makes upgrading your weapons and armor a grind unless you purchase them. Whenever you get a duplicate insignia you're supposed to get gold but you never see it. Because of these things I'm uninstalling the game. It's garbage. Good job devs!"

        "I love this game up until it asked me for a loan for one of the characters for 250 gems that i purchased. I contact Tech support and nothing is being done. After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",
        "In the world of cafe games this one is a gem that stands out like a diamond in the rough. Fun and easy to play, it's set at a relaxing pace with you learning new recipes and chatting with your customers. Who are all really interesting people with unique storylines....I think one of them is trying to steal the Mona Lisa,lol.",
        "Fix the controls! Atleast have an option to enable and disable the editing of the layout or location of the items in-game. Such a pain that God-forbid you touched an item for a half a second too long it will prompt you to move, delete or put that item in storage."

        "It's a nice game, with a great graphics and such but the auto-update for extra files it's kind of annoying. Is there anyway to turn it off? Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

        "great game! auto play is helpful for players who do not have a lot of free time in the real world. eats up battery like a fat kid at a buffet.   not worth downgrading a star but I noticed there is no audio mute option, just turn down volume bar as far to the left. So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",
        "It's been ok so far, I personally don't enjoy the auto feature but I get why it's there... I'm a busy person I have other stuff to do while I really want to game. Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",
        "Not only is it laggy, now after loading and installing the recent update, I can't even log in. After log in screen and after it checks for any update, it logs me out to main menu! This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",
        ".... Like the 100 or more people before me after the March 14th update I'm no longer able to log in for some unknown reason.. No info on the netmarble site about this issue which is odd.. I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it's a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team.

        "I love all the Is-it Love stories, they're fun and a great distraction. My only complaint is that there isn't enough free daily energy! You only get a teensy bit of the story every day, which is maddening. There should be loads more ways to earn energy, especially like the mini games.",
        "Matt seems like kind of an asshat in Season 2. She should just dump him. Could do way better. Like with Daryl perhaps? He obviously cares for her wayyy more than Matt does. Matt only has eyes for Lana. Like he says he loves our girl? I don't think so. I wish you could choose somebody else to date.",
        "Energy is too short & there isn't anything other than a side game for 100 more points to keep you entertained. The app is basically a story with a couple of nice artistic pictures.  Way over priced. You can buy a book for less at Barnes and Nobles and still get twice the amount in content. The the amount of money they ask for engery in this game is ridiculous. Don't be silly  and spend money that you can do better with. Just play for free or not at all.",
        "I think it's a good game but... Let's be fair you don't get to play for long each day before you run out of energy and have to wait 24 hours and even then it's only a few minutes play.... The lack of play time makes me loose all interest in what I believe might be a decent game",
        "So. This is an addictive store. The main characters are very well thought out. A few Grammer error and hick ups in game play. Although this game can be expensive if you don't make the right choice. I had bought the same secret scene twice and it still asks me to buy it. This is the second time this has happened. All in all great game.",
        "I find it aggravating that your energy goes down so fast. You get a few seconds of free play per day. I've paid to get more. But I can't and won't keep doing that when even paying for extra doesn't last long. 😒"

The updates are very slow you have to wait for a while if you've gotten to a certain level,  that sucks for a real gamers.. Hopefully they get around to updating new levels faster. until then I guess I'll download something  else like chess.. Hopefully there's no long wait for updates there!",

Or its my phone or what I don't know. Help please if its a matter of upgrade please do it for us King. I've updated on my phone but still am stuck on rank 11.",
        "My favourite game love the extra games at weekend eg the mountain game wish there was more. This is the game I play all the time love it even when it is difficult would be no fun if it was all easy so good balance keep up the good work give us more of extra challenges where you can win boosters not just at weekend please. When we come to a road block please give us a complementary game to play until we can update it's frustrating to want to play the game but can\"t",

        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "Had friends refer me to the  games. At 1st I wasn't  happy I couldn't  just  select  the games I wanted to play I had to earn the level it was on to open them. It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm",
        "Have so much fun playing this. It's nice to be able to have a \"flutter\" and not use real money. Good fun, great graphics and so many different slots to choose from, plus the rewards are well worth it. Thank you hof! Awesome!! Love this game! Though only one thing to gripe about, the adds are becoming more invasive. Despite this I thoroughly enjoy myself! So keep it up!"

        "I'm not a fan of mobile gaming, but this game is truly something else. I love The Walking Dead, so I gave this a shot, however, after playing Road to Survival (or whatever it's called- it's the TWD game based off of the comics), my expectations were pretty low. This game though, is not Road to Survival; it's so much more. This is how you do a free to play game with microtransactions right. You can buy a lot in this game with money, but you can easily obtain everything on your own, and quite frankly, it's more fun to do that anyways. This game is super addicting and gives me something fun to do when I've got a few minutes. I've been playing it for months, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.",
        "Just a suggestion, it'll be SO MUCH MORE AWESOME probably 10 stars for TWD fans if you could do better missions or events that allow us to get better opportunities to farm for TWD character tokens or class tokens, and also more chance for farming or creating weapons instead of the current set up now. Don't quite like the fact that when deals are awesome but they cost a ton! Try lessen the value a little bit and im sure some players dont mind spending (just my opinion). But overall review, its awesome for TWD fans out there!",
        "It's got good action in graphic. Been playing for a 2 years in 10 month's now.Stay human and Survive.  Up dates all the time love it keep them coming Robert Cregman. Thanks for making the Walking  dead show And game. New stuff to do all the time. In wow all these new survivers. There are some loading issues action issues movement issues alot more mission.",
        "Originally gave you 4 stars, but its one of only a couple of mobile games I have never deleted since installing. Constant content coming in, great use of TWD licence! Keep up the great work- seriously from someone who hates most mobile games!",
        "I've been playing for over 2 years. A few more new maps would be nice and stop nerfing our great traits like interrupt and wrestler! Other than that, great game and great community.",
        "Really good strategy game. The thing that lost it the 5th star is that when I started a second game on another device, it won't play ads for free stuff"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Update: Now it won't even open. Once you find out your progression is rigged, the fun wears off. You will have a win streak going, them \"mysteriously\" a machine will show up with just the right set up to beat yours. Then once you finally get the right configuration to beat that one (however long that takes) another machine with the perfect set up to beat yours shows up again preventing you from progressing. Over and over and over....",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete."

        "So much development has went into this game, the reason why I like it is because of the consistent updates and new stuff. It's hard to find games now with nothing new to bring to the table. It makes you want to invest into this game. Not to mention how generous they can be with the free gifts and whatnot. Keep it up Netmarble!",
        "NM is slowly setting up higher prices for uniform qualities that should be 750 when on sale.. Now all new uniforms are 1050 when on sale even if the bonus and changes are trash. I'm disappointed that this game is changing drastically to a greedy game. Soon i will uninstall this game if this will continue.",
        "This game is awesome. Love playing it everyday and everytime. But  recently I have a problem with the game crashing almost all the time. Please help me fix this problem.  I also want to ask when will you give Odin a uniform? A better skillset, a heal, and a piercing ability for him to shine again as a god. Looking forward to it Netmarble.",
        "There are some incredibly predatory practices with the in app purchases.  For example, if you buy the new Emma Frost pack, you won't get her work fully leveled gear, and that isn't made clear on the purchase screen.  You will need to buy the package at least once, and possible multiple times over to actually advance her.",
        "This game was good. The past 6 months have just been a display of how game companies do not care for user experience but rather their pockets. Cash grab all the way. This game had potential to be the greatest, but a pure let down for the entire community.",
        "Game is easily a 4/5 stars, it's fun, addictive, and fair. It has had it wobbles but for new players, there is enough to do to keep you interested without needing to pay cash."

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "Please improve the casino...it's kinda a bit unfair because no matter what I've spent, I don't seem to get a lot of diamonds... considering that the places require diamonds to upgrade...so in order for the game not to be so stressful, you should really improve the casino."

        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Like ot a lot. Taskforces need to be improved drasticly. Focus on playing with others makes it a lot more fun. EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "New Review because of update: ° I really love this game. I'm hooked. Relaxing yet stimulating. Some levels are easy as cutting through soft butter with lots of delightful bombs and others take several tries to master and need that one devise a strategy and some others are much up to luck. I love that variation: relaxing and stimulating and sometimes a bit frustrating. ° I had finished all the levels of version 2 and then waited for an update which came with new levels and I finished them also about 4 weeks ago. I've opened the game every day since to see if yet an other update came, and yes, yesterday it did and have already finished all levels (that says more about my fanaticism than it says about the difficulty of the game). ° I appreciate the tournament (I topped the monthly yesterday but had dropped 3 steps while I was sleeping and have clawed my way back to the top this evening, but I guess I'll be back down tomorrow. But it's fun! And I got generous daily prizes. ° And I love the new version that even though I again have finished all levels, I can just go on playing thanks to the Level Tower (even if it at 46 repeated a previous level). ° Lovely graphics, good game sound.",
        "Annoying and boring. Got headaches playing this. You can spend 5 sets of 5 lives each without passing the task. It's rather a \"Push to pay or wait forever\" game. Uninstalled. Sorry.",

        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?"

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "good game but y'all gotta fix how valuable the gems are. its impossible to get lots of gems without paying and you're only rewarded 1 per video. and then it costs me 150 gems to get TWO hatchery spots? that's bs. fix that and I'll give 5",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous."

        "Dear team, It's really a awesome game ever. I'm playing it since 2 years. Very addictive. But i request you to all, when we start a TEAM RACE many players join clans for playing team race n take efforts in team race for getting better reward but many of them team leaders kick players just before ending the team race n players won't receieve any reward for it. It was happened with me 2 times. So please do any update for those players who take much efforts in team war and then also they get nothing. Thanks",
        "This game used to be 5 star. They've changed it where all team events are gem sucks. You have no chance of winning without using a considerable amount of gems. They've taken away most in game free ways to get gems, and to buy them is not worth it, they're very over priced. It's not a team event, it's a paid for event. If they change it and make it more fair for everyone I'll make a new rating.",
        "It's a nice game with so many awesome monsters. I like it and it's my favourite game in this category. My suggestion is that if you can include an option to cancel ongoing breeding by giving gold or gems or without anything, it would have been better. The game has events that comes very frequently, it helps so much in getting new monsters and or progressing in the game.",
        "The game is awesome! The game play, the monsters, and also the actual fighting and graphics. This is one of my most rated games and my most played; I couldn't go a day without it. It's competition is so good online with people and in dungeons and the map, also team wars are fun with your friends. Get this game you'll never regret it.",
        "($$$$) Don't play this game. I understand games want to make $ but this is just cazy. There's only a handful of monsters you are able to buy with gold ALL the rest require gems. Only played a few days but there's really not much you can do in this game other then collect food, gold and breed more worthless monsters."

It can be the best fun ever. But it exponentially grows so you'll never hit the top without continual spending .  Miss all the wonderful peeps but refuse to be a whale or a cash cow .",

You can only get so far, then you a required to spend actual cash to continue playing. If you want to max out your base you better have DEEP pockets. This is not a joke, if you want to be a serious player, it will cost you around $300 a week just to keep up. Only the rich get anywhere in this game.",

One cyber Titan can zero anything that has highest normal T52 troops and best bio titans...... without sending a commander Once u reach building level 1100 offered for less than 19.99 USDyou will have no access to packs less than $100 USD and no access to RSS for older troops",
        "I use to have one of the strongest bases in MKST.. Mistress Vixen..nickname Vix.  Anyhow i have spent easily around $3,000 us dollar on this game. And one day my shield lapsed and I got zeroed after about 40 plus hits. I quit playing. I started back and spent  littke money cause I missed my alliance people I started to consider family after almost a year of play.  Anyhow now they came out with cybernetics and the packs for that are $99.00 everytime. I'm sorry this has went to far. This is a pay to play game 100%.",
        "Lots to do to increase your power, tons of new buildings giving massive power boosts, just wait a little bit & you may get lucky with a $99 pack being reduced to $19. Make sure you have plenty of money for this game. If you don't have the money, then starting out new, you'll be at a stand still around HQ level 20 & commander level 50, with only increasing power by researching, training more troops, & building traps for your wall. This game has been slowing down a lot lately though, not sure if it's the game or my phone causing it.",

Their lvl and power are bigger than mine, so I spend more money an that still don't help for the event this game is starting to suck. My res base I have never spent no then on it and I have it Hq lvl 350 what is up with that. Helping a base who has not spent no money. Help the people who has spent money"

        "Game is amazing Love it. Customer service well you have none. All you get is automated message and no way to speak to someone about any issues. You give them what they need and no one fallows up on it. All you get back is the same automated response. Then they remove your ticket. So if you have problems with the game don't bother contacting them it's a waist of your time. THERE'S NO ONE THERE FOR YOU. Can't get my account back. That's all I want. It's simple NO???????",
        "Another month, another violent smash and cash grab. Putting an entire LT behind a character requirement that 99.9% of the player base has next to no chance of getting with obfuscated \"odds\" that require one to spend 1000s of dollars for a \"chance\"(not even guaranteed) to get a character. At this point, I'm only updating the game to keep my reviews more relevant and higher weight.",
        "It's a good game. Awesome graphics, great gameplay,amazing superstar etc. But not good for free player because you don't get good superstar and rate of getting better superstar is very very low. Even some time in 4 pulls. I didn't get any 2 star silver card. Please make rare superstar drop rate more or I can't go any further in this game and make this game more free player friendly.",
        "Basically I have been playing this game over the past year... It is a totally addictive and 100% entertaining game... Only downside which has forced me to stop playing is that I have just acquired a new phone and attempted to load the game with my login details (for both Facebook & Google) but have found that I now have to start from the beginning again... I've now become mildly disappointed unless this can be fixed I don't think I will be playing again as I put too much time into this for me to start from the beginning again!!!",
        "It is my favrt game ever when i play this i stuck with this game I want to say something  now it's giving  too many ads and a problem  when I log out it says only one thing again and again that this account using on another device  but it's not real and what I do I am help less and I can't get new powerful superstars 😭😭😭😭😭when I open with cash he always give me duplicates.. Give some new cool events like wrestlemaina T-shirts..",
        "Love playing this game until google services crashed my phone and when I came back on to the game after having to reset everything, I lost access to my account. I have contacted customer services and all they do is send a pregenerated message that answers and resolves nothing!!  5 days and still receiving the same message back.. Even my faction leader has provided information to determine that my account is indeed my account and that I am active in his faction. But still SCOPELY send the same annoying generated message. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICES EVER!!!"

        "For a free game? I can't complain too much especially if i don't pay for it. The containers are actually a good addition to this game since you get containers for free. If you're lucky enough you can win a premium tank and those things are not cheap! But wargaming actually give them away for free. The event is impossible to finish if you don't pay with gold and to win a tank you must pay a huge amount of $$$. But for casual and f2p players? I think you'll enjoy it. It's a game guys, play for fun!",
        "The game is good compared to the game i often play online. I could have rated this game all five stars. The controls for driving must have other options to choose from. And its not suitable for android phones that has 5 inches sreen display. My thumb keeps slipping off whenever i try to maneauver the  vehicle. On Pc's much more easier to handle using a keyboard and a mouse.",
        "Hello. I love WOT and trying to play together witg my son. But we've chosen different servers (Europe & Russia) and now i cant find him in the players list to be able to join one platoon. I also cant connect to his server and he cant connect to mine cause system doesnt allow it. can you please suggest how we can join one platoon in this case? Thank you.",
        "Best mobile game I've played, more fun than the PC world of tanks for sure. Only real complaint is that it takes up a lot of space on my phone... It's worth the investment in memory though. Make sure you're in a good wifi spot and have a portable battery and happy tanking",
        "Not a bad game.  I'm a little sick of the unrealistic tanks.  Also the unrealistic play in some ways.  I wish there was a mode that limited you to real tanks of the same time period and had more realistic damage based on the weapons.  For example, I don't want to see the Dracula tank and the 88mm on my Tiger should blow a Sherman away in 1 shot at point blink range, not 6 shots...",
        "Why is 6 of my team on one area while I am in the other. Because of this spawning system I died literally 5 seconds after the battle started. Great game though. Why is there so much lag. And why are my controls frozen. I move forward a  little and then I move 50 feet away from my spot. Fix this and then you get a big fat 5 stars."

One is like every one else is the continuous loading every now and then to the point that I try to avoid getting back to the main page so I won't have to wait for it to start loading. Bandai Namco can do better than this. The other issue is the short period of the gashas and not acquiring gold god cloth characters like what was promised. By the time I acquire the required amount of holy stones the gasha event is already gone.",
        "Good graphics, lots to do. Only bad thing is the non stop loading wheel in the bottom left of the screen that causes the game to constantly freeze when going back to the main page of the game.  Seems like the developers don't care about the infinite loop, they just won't fix it, just sad because it's a good game.",
        "When the game works, it's great. But the same problem like everyone with the main menu screen crashes and no icon pressing works.  Update 1.39 and the loading issue persists in the main menu.... Really dev.!?! The only new thing is their app icon. All the problems stay.... Unbelievable.",
        "New 1.38 version still does not fix the spinning wheel bug that is caused by the chat functionality.  Since the issue does not happen in Asia, the developers don't even acknowledge the bug that happens in the rest of the world. Sad!   Solution: Just REMOVE the CHAT functionality from the Home Screen. It's useless anyway.",

Its that it crashes too often loading forever having to restart the whole app again simple issue but get a little annoying after a while.  But other then that love this game",

        "Excellent storyline, graphics, and doesn't waste your time with ads. This is how the e type of games should be done. The only thing that would make it better is if they actually gave out gems. This is their 1 downfall - not receiving any gems at all. Therefore, you are forced to either buy them or select the choice you didn't really want in order to get the free choice. This, of course, changes your storyline. However, you can see at the end of each episode the percentage of your choices compared with other users and its normally in the 90 percentile. Still this is a wonderful game that I would highly recommend.",
        "Awesome game but it take 4hrs to give only 2 tickets and u play for almost 10min and u dnt get extra diamonds.. Thats the only part putting me off the game. Also waaay to many ads!",

        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The only problem I have with this game is that, if you have brought everything out of each of your stores and still have coins available WHY CAN'T WE USE OUR LEFT OVER COINS AND BUYS SPOONS? Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

The game creators could give 2 sh/ts about what is going on .",

Problems free=5 stars.. What happen? I cannot even play the game now.. I once install and play and later uninstall because of game problem. Now I install and try to play again. I cannot play.. What is the problem? I also want to recover my account too..",

Some upgrades take up to a week of upgrading rendering those villagers useless aswell as the rate at which resources comes in as you collect doesnt compensate enough for the costs of upgrades. Its unnecessarily STRETCHED OUT. because of this its a 3 star rating...DONT DOWNLOAD IF YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE. Been playing a year and i dont feel my progress is a representation of the time i have put in. Been playing almost daily!",

My game since the update has been freezing up and lagging to the point that I select something (a wall for example) and the whole  game freezes and takes a million years just to LOAD. If this game isn't fixed, I'm demanding all my money spent on the game refunded and uninstallment. Not happy.",
        "This is the exact definition of a strategy game, the controls are great and its free. You get to choose your own nation which just adds to the strategy, plus whatever you do in a battle can affect the entire battle. I would recommend it to people who want something with strategy and a bit of hardcoreness. The learning curve is quite steep sometimes."

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "I just started the game a couple of days ago, but I'm already hooked.  Like most games, you kind of learn as you move along, but a little more guiding would be very helpful. Thanks for making a fun game! I am having a problem getting past the loading screen though. I tried clearing cache, forced stop, delete files, even uninstalling and reinstalling again.",
        "Easy to learn with loads of variables to keep it interesting. Graphics are stellar. As with most 'free' games, there are lots of incentives for you to get out your wallet; if you're as unwilling to do so as I am, you'll have to be patient. Can't fault the developers. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though"

        "I'd really like to give this game a 5 star rating. Their customer service is fantastic. The graphics are great. Lots of missions to go on. And they have events every week. Exactly what I'd be looking for in a star trek game. But the thing I just can't get past is the gambling aspect for role playing. All I want to do is role play as a captain of a galaxy class starship. But after a month of almost daily spins at the Dabo table (including spending real money on the vip pass and dilithium, and rolling multiple times a day) I haven't gotten a single galaxy class schematic. I don't want to play borg, or klingon, or older enterprise (hell, I'd trade all of those for just a generic galaxy class). It doesn't seem fair the game doesn't give you a more direct way to role play as your favorite ship. Isn't that the whole point of a game like this?",
        "Great collections of star trek universe, but the game screams micro transactions and gambling around every corner. The game gives you a great concept that gets hindered by currency gates. Only play if you want a nostalgic taste of star trek themed free to play game",
        "I absolutely love this game! It's concept is (though not entirely unique to Star Trek) cool. I just love the voices for characters and would love more characters to have voices.  For the longest time I was a F2P player, and when Events first started I was constantly in the Top 1000 so don't buy into that \"You have to pay to win\" nonsense. If you do put money into this game make it the $4 Monthly Dilithium Card it is worth it $4 for 3000 Dilithium if you can afford it.",
        "Progress stalls unless you spend insulting amounts of money (dilithium prices are absurd) to get better characters. In the early days of the game you could progress easily, but now I feel as more high-paying players have joined they want you to spend money to progress, and their prices really are absurd. The game is fun, but they're greedy. In the events especially, those who pay more get significantly better awards. A bit disappointing for those of us that have supported the game with occasional purchases from the beginning.",
        "Don't listen to the haters who say it's Pay for Play and DB is a greedy company. It's bull, no amount of money will get you where time invested into the game will. Oh, and if the game even loads slow for a second DB is likely to send free stuff. If people complain about somthing...free stuff. So I say keep up the great work! One thing though, I'd be awesome if we could name our starbases. Just a thought.",
        "Love everythinggg tho id like to like i want to controle the ship my self manuver it myself open world like eh thats my piont this might change the game and other peoples view/perspective pionts but it would complete my dream of getting the one thing i always love and always will love star trek.😁"

        "This game is amazing a full on batlle with strategic ways to beat your opponent. The only thing im concern with is not seeing much to do in an alliance than donating troops. I would like to see a way were you can team battle and get awards but other than that its a five star game",
        "This game is amazing! But enemy units keep getting stuck behind walls Also there are a few enemy lands that are not responding when you tap on them. This didnt happen before.  I think updating attack list would be good. So you could see who you have attacked, not just who attck you. Just  a thought",
        "Very bad customer support!!! I was lost my phone and they can't help me to back to my account where I was spend lots money and time . I get access to my email ( i was ask for authorization code on email... refused )I can show my transaction from bank account...refused. only I don't have transaction on my Google play I don't know why.  Very poor help!",
        "It's a great game but I think it be better if you created workers and mined,  lumbered, and gather favors or technology like warcraft use to be like.  The commands are also touchy and the battle displays for viewing if kinda difficult to  keep up with. But it's fun and a little bit addictive.",
        "Amazing graphic but really poor gameplay... Even lowest level, it's hard to complete easy campaign. Every win need to paid. Useless to raid... Uninteresting how the mission needed to complete... Disliked this game bcoz of the poor gameplay and the way of how to complete the mission.",
        "Awesome graphics. Awesome concept. You actually choose your tactic. Not just....\"I'm going to send a march at a castle and hope for the best\" like so many other games do now. In my opinion, its a very nice single player game. Only things that would make it more intriguing would be the addition of defensive towers or being able to attack at same time with an ally. Other than that, great game. And you don't NEED to spend money!"

        "Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "The game itself is fabulous. Cute farm. Good graphics. Good work on that front. Yet being a bit more generous with westbucks in game or making some things more payable with your coins. I get that games don't create themself. But I personally am more likely to pay for games you can actually play for a bit after doing a purchase. And I don't really get that feeling here. But none the less the game itself is a work of art 😊"

        "I am ABSOLUTELY LOVING THE NEW GAMES!!! The free coins are very generous, but my only pet peeve is that I cannot seem to keep them very long. They go as fast as I win them! Also, the club coins could be a little higher. I send gifts to both friends and club members daily, but they're not enough to truly help anyone to continue to play.  But besides that, I just love DoubleU casino. I've been a member since practically the beginning and I will remain a faithful user! ☆☆☆☆☆",
        "You don't win the bonuses The free credit u get dont last, as quick as u get them u loss. I been playing for awhile now  ready to delete just wasting my time. No jackpot at all. I dont know how people get millions even billions. Don't buy your credits... A year later nothing has changed",
        "This game is the biggest ripoff I have spent 100s of dollars of real money for nothing lost it all. Never get a Jackpot. A huge scam all they want is your money. No fun playing when you lose all the time really sucks would not recommend to anyone. I know you can't allways win but once in a while would be nice. Thanks for nothing Double U Casino.  Nicky",

        "Really enjoy this game but its very hard to do well unless you pay real money to buy extras! There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5☆",
        "I love this game, but some of the glitches are very annoying. For example I just bought a shirt for a challenge and it will not let me use it. This has happened before. I've probably lost a few thousand dollars of in game money because of this glitch. There are other glitches but that's the worst one. Overall the game is fun though."

When resizing the map to the smallest via pinching, the resource selection icon on top of the buildings  is still too big and overlaps buildings next to each other. It doesn't look great. The sizes before the update were perfect. Please fix.",
        "This is day 16  i still cant open the game. DO NOT UPGRADE.When I did upgrade my game will not work. DO NOT UP GRADE an they will not respond to my emails my posting. Sent a ticket. Nothing at all.  I Folloewd all of the list the developer told me to do now I lost my game all everything I have done the loss of alot of real money an still have got refund or info how to. I loved this game. Now not at all we hold our end of the contact why are you allowed to break the agreement. Its now 2016 an I still no help",

        "REMOOOVE THE NEW UPDATE.  loved the game till the update yesterday,  I have spent about $400 on this game and now I feel like \"throwing it away\" the huge icons are in the way and the up down arrow for all the extra controls was unnecessary when they were better all small,  I feel like it hurts my eyes trying to play this game now.  I will update my review with 5 stars when the game us updated again to the way it was.",
        "Customer service SUCKS. I have had nothing but problems with gems missing, cant watch the videos to spin the spirit wheel.  They sent me an email today for me to uninstall the game and reinstall it and that they said should fix the issues. Well it started my game back at the beginning and the is no way for me to retrieve my last games progress which was pretty far along. This use to be one of my favorite games but on Android it still is fun but to many bugs and like I said CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS"

It took me over a year to get my VIP high enough to get the monthly meta heroes. I get an hour or two a day out of it and even when I didn't have the monthly paid heroes I had a fun time. I don't mind spending $15/month for the amount of time the game helps me kill.",
        "I'm a paying customer, which they call \"VIP\" but you best believe you are far from important. I had an issue with a purchase in December, but support takes a week per message to reply and isn't useful at all about the issue and tells you they can't help. Should have let Google refund the money before the 48 hours instead of giving their support a chance.",
        "Don't download the game . If u want to win u must spend thousands dollars. A huge skins with control every month 2 new heroes with amazing power. Every month making new heroes and the old ones getting trash. Random game no strategy. Just click for pic. Ucool don't do anything. Don't download!!! I played more than one year and every month it's getting worst. The forgetting about players. They think only for cash. Ucool one of the worst organisation..if u don't spend a money please don't start the game .nice pictures  and that it )))",
        "This game was a very well balanced game between free play gamers and those that put money into it. Not anymore. If you want to be competitive you must put handreds of dollars each month (no joke). Very dissapointed in the way this game has become.",
        "A very good game but a pay to win. I myself paid 73$ and I am VIP 8. This game can be fun without paying but to get the most out of it atleast  buy an annual card for 30$. If you have even more to throw away try buying all the cards when they run out get a new one. (Mainly Annual and Season Card. Week card isn't a must have). Also if you are new to the game wait for a new server to start. That way you wont fall behind. I am on server 210 and have also played on server 207. I was in this game when it was brand new and purple heroes were the best. I was in 1 of the 1st servers and f2P I quit the game at lvl 50 though. All in All if you want to play this game prepare 100$",
        "The menu is very unresponsive when scrolling. Also, when killing enemies, particularly after using a special ability, the enemy simply freezes and then fades away - there's no animation for the death of the enemy and this is disappointing and detracts from the immersion. Otherwise it's a good game, but significantly more heroes would be necessary to keep me interested."

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",

You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",

Has caused me to not play for a day or two because of this but also what makes me come back it offers that challenge that is often lost in most games like this where is the fun of there is no risk. Not to many tedious tasks after about day 5 no longer logging in every 3 hours to start a build project or something.",
        "Other people might think its a boring game, but this game really fits for someone who doesnt want to get stressed out in a game.. really love the concept. Been a player here for almost 6 years now.. tried other games but still going back to this game.",

        "Worked fine yesterday, logged in this morning and it now says I'm back to level 14 with no diamonds stars or coins and barely nothing on the island??!!! No way of contacting support/help desk either as just get error message when trying. Hugely disappointed after all the months of playing!",
        "Should have longer time on the tradefest. Not everyone has time to just sit on the game 24/7.  More opportunities to win things. Don't like how I have to pay to plant my own crops on my own island though?! And why has the harvest count changed? Why make bad changes to the game? It just shys people away.",
        "Loved this game and the players in it. BUT if you are not in their beta test group it's getting discouraging that you are not treated as equal as the others and you need to put much more effort and time to get rewards and move along in the levels. Don't start unless you like to be treated with no respect at all",
        "Well the game is great!! This morning when I was using it tho the time it would take for things to be done was reduced greatly, everything was 2 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins and 15, and I was impressed and decided that if its a new update I'd glady play more often. The second time I went back on everything was back to the old time period of production. I was disappointed and didn't bother to spend even 5mins more on it. I believe everyone would find it more exciting to play if the time for production wasn't so long. I hope that this can happen in another update, if not, well I can't do nothing about that.",
        "Gave it a lower rating because I sent 3 messages to support regarding loading error and never received a response just kept sending me to the games web page which was of no help. Very fun game but no support it seems",
        "I love this game! It is my favorite! I like how can earn gems! I love the different 'contests.' However, I tried really hard to get the snowy owl and didn't make it in time. Now I'm not playing as much but still love the game!"

Then you get a message assuming you dont understand how the game works and a thanks for understanding.  So the poor customer support is what got this game it's 2 stars from me and the prize screws.",
        "I have 1 level 20 T. Rex, 1 level 10 T. Rex, and a level 10 Pteradon and I STILL can't beat it. It's pissing me off. Do I need to have 3 fully maxed out T. Rexes in order to beat this stage? It's stupid.",
        "It was good at the beginning then I  got to a high level and it started kicking me out. I still have the same problem. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it even went onto their Facebook page and explain but there was still no fix. I give this game 2 stars. No point in trying to advance if problem is not fixed.",

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "Cannot get the app to load properly, but it is a really fun and addictive game. Great challenges, and I like seeing what designs others have come up with. I've won challenges with very little money, it is possible, if that is a concern for people. I would like to see challenges developed more quickly, and ways to earn more money. I usually have very little money to work with. Maybe have an option to get keys or money when voting. But overall I really enjoy the game."

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "It would be better if they offered more free chips. Rather than bombarding us Every time we log in with there outrageous prices. Also a flush draw Every other hand and usually someone hits. Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done."

        "I have really enjoyed this game from the first week it dropped. Never spent a penny. Most things I can compete in. What players say about pay2play is true though.  If you want to play at the highest level you HAVE TO PAY! There is a very clear pay wall and everyone knows it. If your starting off and your free to play it will take you awhile and I don't even think it will be work it unless you plan to put at least 6 month in to be somewhat relevant.",
        "Stop doing these tutorials that force you to select their options, if I need a tutorial I'll use the tutorial, if I want to just play the game and figure it out along the way let me do that.   I'm so sick of these games that don't give you any option. Is there anyone that likes tutorials that are done like this?",
        "Pros: • Semi-Balanced pvp. • Tons of characters. • Fun leveling system. • Entertaining in-game events  • Challenging story mode. • No need to pay to become very strong.  • Auto-battles that save time.   Cons: • Constant Pop-ups reminding you to purchase loot boxes. • You will get wrecked by serious pay-to-wins. • Impossible drop rates for 5☆ characters and Chaos/Order heros. • Paying to unlock 5☆ heros that may or may not be 5☆. • The company spamming copy pasted messages to players who have beef with thier game instead of constructive replies.  Overall: Still a pretty cool game.",
        "A game with buckets of potential, led astray by poor decisions & short term constant cash grabs(multiple times a week)  Poor balancing - stat accensions, Crown dust upgrade costs ( when even  avip 10+ lvl60 developer acc hadn't upgraded any crowns..I've checked dozens of high vip lvl 60s 0 upgraded crowns) 6* artis are pointless & don't feel worth owning.  Constant pop ups, easily 40-50 store pop ups per day sometimes multiple times within a minute.  the Lucky 7 quest was criminal, horrendous design & I won't be spending a penny with you guys again until I see you go down a better path.   the positives, autoing but being able to leave the game. Festival/ hero events are pretty damn good although it be nice to see different style events that 'have gameplay'  Characters are well designed & are extremely fun to use.   To summarise, has some excellent features but it's let down by some horrendous balancing & constant cash grabs that would get EA taking notes.",

        "Fun game. Good graphics, and overall good fishing simulator. However, its ridiculously rigged. I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",
        "OUT OF ALL THE FISHING GAMES THAT ARE ON THE APP STORE I'VE FOUND ONLY 3 WORTH PLAYING,AND THIS MY FRIENDS IS ONE OF THEM!!!!!!! IT'S A MUST DOWNLOAD AND TRY FISHING GAME/APP!! GREAT GRAPHICS, AND DESIGN!!! IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS FISHING GAME/APP THEN YOU ARE MISSY OUT ON A FANTASTIC DAY OF FISHING!!!!  SO STOP READING AND GET TO DOWNLOADING THIS APP, AND GET TO ALL THE INCREASABLE FISHING FUN!!!!!!😎😋🤣😄😅😁😂🤗😜😛😌😳😱😰",
        "This game is so AWESOME! This game will also teach you alot about the fish you are catching. Great time killer. Just becareful you'll kill to much time. LOL I just realized it's 2:04am. I have to be at work at 6:00am. Download this game now! Thank you for making an AMAZING fishing game. Hats off to the creater's",
        "This game is great and what it does, massive castles sprawling battles across the ages with wizards on dragons back firing missiles at unicorns below... Erm it's fishing they lured me in and I'm hooked, what else is there to say. Great game.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

I have looked at my data usage for this game and it has used well over 2gb of data from 19 th February untill 19th March, a months data usage. Not pleased Abount it as I only play the game for short intervals.",

It was fun however I don't understand how to play it. With the right instructions I could probably do better. Maybe my son can explain it to me a little bettet.",

        "I love playing this game. It is now my favorite phone game of all times. I have seen other reviews about waiting for energy takes too long. It does take a long time but to me that is part of it. It makes you slow down and enjoy simple fun. Too be honest all of us need to slow down and enjoy life around us. I play it on my breaks at work. The way you play this game allows for  short or long periods of play . Also it's quite fun seeing the little guy demolish tiles. It truly is an awesome game. I have recommended it to family and friends.",
        "I deleted all of my games except for Diggy's Adventure. This is my favorite game. I am going to play this game until me and Diggy win, and then I'm going to play it again from scratch. Google should make a whole lot of games like this. They are way better than match 3 puzzle games. I love cats I wish they could make a kitty's Adventures game like Diggy's Adventure.",
        "I've played this game for almost 2 years and have not once had a problem and have spent a lot of money. For some reason it's now crashing every few mins. I don't lose progress or anything but it's getting frustrating to have to keep restarting. I've even updated the app on my Android. Please help? It's my favorite app and I just want to dig!",
        "I really like this game but... It has been glitching A LOT for me lately. While I am playing it will freeze my phone. If I walk away for just a few seconds it freezes. My favorite glitch is after I watch a video for energy and before I use it the game kicks me out. Upon my return the energy is gone and I can't get energy for 2 more hours. 😐",
        "Very addictive game but you spend more time waiting for energy than playing. When you have unavoidable tiles of over 400 points it doesn't take long to lose all your stored energy. I thought games were for playing, not waiting around. It's play for 5 minutes wait for an hour. It's a shame because some of the puzzles are quite good.",
        "I love this game. It's super addicting and best paft..you don't HAVE to spend money on diamonds or add ons to actually play. I really get bored of games when all they want is more of your hard earned money. So keep up the great work."

        "WOW. This game has everything! My only complaint is that the \"earning\" free in game currency section (downloading and playing other games to certain level), does not yield in game currency, so do not bother. Just pay for stuff when it goes on sale. But otherwise, WOW! This is like fanfic, sims, empire, battle, idle, all in one! Hpw often do you get an all in one game based off an amazing franchise?? (As of this date, ive been playing for 2 months, spent $10)",
        "I reckon this is the best game in the world!! I am a enormous fan of how to train your dragon, so i reckon you have done an awesome job at making this game. But, the only problem is i don't like the part when it loads and takes forever, and sometimes it doesn't even load and yo have to use wifi and takes up alot of storage on your device. So i sugest decreasing those things or stopping those things.",
        "First everything went out smoothly. Now the assets keeps on redownloading everytime I try to play it. My phone still has 7gb free memory, I also tried following ghe suggestion to clear up some space it still doesn't work. But overall it was awesome. I just hope the issue of redownloading will get fixed asap.",
        "When you complete a level in the currently available adventure, you may spin a wheel. Why do I always get resources? Do I seriously need 18 cards worth of resources, each card worth approximately 1 million fish or wood? Please tweek the chances of getting something else! I don't even mind getting lots of sage fruit at this point... At least it would be useful. Resources aren't really useful when you are filled up on resources.",
        "Love the game. Just wish it gave a little more direction on what and how to do certain things. And wish you didn't have to wait hours sometimes 19 to hatch an egg. But they do give you the option to pay to speed up the process. Also wish that they weren't so stingy with giving ruins/coins to pay for things they ask you to do.",
        "Love it! I downloaded this for my kids who love the movies and TV series, but I've become addicted! I've spent a bit of money over the roughly 6-9 months I've had it, but I haven't minded. The earn free runes has created issues in random phone calls and spam emails, so I don't use that anymore.   I agree with someone else's comment about the Book of Dragons - I found it much easier previously. Also, I've had a red number on mine for weeks and I still can't work out what it's for...I've searched through the book, I'm searching for dragons when I can, and still no idea what it's about.   I keep getting the download new assets but I know that's because my phone is full and I can't delete anything else LOL. I'm looking to upgrade my phone soon so hopefully it will stop that.  Overall, it's definitely a game I'd recommend (and I have). Thanks."

        "This is a fairly clever game, my son (5)and me enjoy the strategy.  Once you learn the importance of each character it becomes even better. The main negative is it's completely fixed to try and lure you to purchase better cards and upgrades. You can win 8 games in a row then you lose them, it's about that number every time, coincendence? I think not. it's very hard to even get to castle 6 and we've been trying for about a month.",
        "Your game server is from the stone age.  Too slow. Ruins the entire game.  You charge money for this game.  At least fix the server. Also opponents get gems faster at times.  Prob server issue also.  Editors choice?  They must of played it for 30 min.  Played for a few months. Fed up with frustration.",
        "1.The player with the highest data speed wins the war. 2.I wish  mana can be looted from opponents. 3.I wish there is a clan war. 4.Some epic cards are too expensive that they can never be owned by poor players.  Just a point of view.",

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "💖LOVE THIS GAME!  BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING GRAPHICS on each level. Continues to the next story line and game level without any ads. Only issue it keeps freezing up on me as a new player to this game. I hope I don't have to uninstall it as  its the best came I've come across that I have truely enjoyed. To many games on Google play with kiddie themes. This one is just what I've been looking for. I 💖💖💖💖 it. But if it keeps freezing up I'll have no choice but to uninstall it. How sad that would be.",
        "Game is not fun at all. You spend too much time looking for stuff that it won't give you, not to mention that you need to match 5 gems to get any kind of special gem unlike other match 3 games where you get a special gem when you match 4 or more gems. If they change that I will be willing to give it another try. But until then I'm uninstalling the game and won't reinstall again.",
        "I wasn't expecting to like this game but I started it 3 hours ago and I'm still playing so it must have something good about it or I wouldn't still be here. I'm more of a play a few min and move on. It has pretty graphics, and nice story line.",
        "I love this game! The graphics are awesome and the games themselves are difficult but winnable. Just don't plan on playing through it very rapidly. The only complaint I have is that the story line is disjointed and sometimes difficult to keep track of. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes match 3 games.",
        "Great game, nice to play. But too many instructions to play makes this game BORED. Waste a lot of time. Sorry to say, I just uninstall.",
        "It is ok and worth a download. I am at level 36. The first 10 levels took two hours, then it got hard to make progress.  This is greedware requiring many $100s to play very long. The initial game plays over an hour, then becomes tedious and time-consuming. It is fine to play when on the toilet in the morning, and that seems appropriate. Mostly, this is just another match three game with excellent graphics and a modest story. Skip all the side games, those just waste resources prompting you to buy time or resources for real cash.  Never waste jewels to keep playing as there are unlimited replays only requiring you to wait for more energy to slowly but for free to build up for the next day's 15 minutes of play. The rewards for playing daily go at least for a year, so it takes a long time to finish."

        "I absolutely love the story line and I've spent more on the game than I'd like to admit. But spending money doesn't really get you much farther because the energy goes so quickly. I think you would get far better reviews and more happy customers if you got rid of the energy system and upped the ads for more revenue from that standpoint. Then you could keep the micro transactions for the secret scenes. This way you'd still be making money,  but your customer retention would go up. I have so many ideas that would help this app out and I'd love to share them as I love this story. If you are interested in what I have to say please reply",
        "I love the game. Wish we didnt have to pay for every secret scene and had a little bit more energies before having to wait for more or buy some. Would be great if we had more options for free energy. Love the story and characters. Hurry with season two already!!!  Im anxious to see further stories on ryan and the character Lol ❤.",
        "It's really a good game. It's awesome! But that energies are my main problem! Don't you think that...... only 300 energies that means only 30 lines are not enough and too little for a day..!?..!???!.. and 10 energies per line isn't too much!!??! Please make it down to 5 energies for each lines...and only for dialogues.. And if you give 500 or 100 energies (if 1 line cost 5 energies then there will be only 100 or 200 lines. Not much for a whole day!!!!!) and take 10 hours to get free energies again then the game will be perfect!! Everyone can't buy energies (including me)! You know! Please consider this case sympathetically.!.!..  I beg you.....!....",
        "Lovely story line... love story that keeps you coming back everyday.... at times we are urged to buy energies.. however the energy provided gives sufficient dosage of the story each day... sad that it's going to get to the end...  And i wish I could go back and re read certain moments which is not possible.... apart from it.. this is amazing...",
        "Great storylines!!! Great graphics!  However the energy to even do one chapter is way too low!!!  There should be more choices in filling up the energy.  Let your veiwers choose to watch more ad's or something similar to games where each day you can have one chapter and keep the secret moments as a paid option.  I myself would  have more of my friends play,share and even buy if the cost wasn't $100+ for ten chapters!  Oh and FYI check your editing just a few hiccups in a few clips.   Huge fan on the writer/authors...  Very steamy!! Sincerely JR",
        "This game is misleading. You can only play the \"secret scenes\" if you pay, but the wording makes it sound like your choice so you keep playing in hopes you can see one. And the secret scenes I assume are the ones which actually push the relationship forward. The game staggers and is deeply misleading."

        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "Good game but......after a day into it you make no coin. After every level upgrade it pushes the (buy) equipment option. Not to mention every time you level up. You got to.exit out 15 boxes.before you can continue. Good game but, it's a failure on the free to play aspect.  My rating is fair and final. It's a (ok)  game but many better ones out thwre",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",
        "Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s"

        "I think this game has very good everything, the only thing about the game play is that they trick you kind of and it is hard to get Easter Eggs and stuff. Or when you jump off a train and there is one of those things you have to roll under but you have no time so the police catches you. Or maybe I am not good with those things. Yeah, probably just I am not good at this game.",
        "Why is it difficult to get daily challenge without using data?  And one can't see other users scores without data. Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

I really want the teleporter but I can't get enough coins and I've been playing for AGES! Otherwise, brilliant game always fun. Time consuming.Thank you!"

        "Who made that script, for mobile games it has been the most exciting sports game. I must say it is very complicated specially in the starting but you get addicted to it just for its complications but love to be a manager.. Well done not easy to create such a difficult so deep kind of script.",
        "Let me start by saying awesome game, great graphics playing on and off for years but what's is going on with this game play. Defenders literally running by ball carrier, ridiculous passes by my team and missing clear scoring opportunities. Slowness of my team, no attacking effort, no tackling effort, keeper not even stopping a single shot. Guess I need to just stop playing again. Overall good game just work on the gameplay and AI decision. Uninstalling."

Unfortunately, i have one issue i can't access the chat room, no messages, cant access mh own profile. It keeps saying network error even though i am currently playing the game smoothly. If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",
        "If you put gold army in your garrison troops its impossible to invade you even the attacker is highest level. Attacking castle is very costly you need to attack many times for few resources. The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",
        "I think I would like this game but somehow I have never played it or downloaded it until today but the game is not at the beginning and I keep getting kicked off as it says I have logged into another device.  Not the first time I have ran into this problem.  Please help me fix this.  I have cleared the game data uninstalled and all that nonsense.",
        "i would rate it 5* but i can only play the game on wifi. unable to play on Data. Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom....so i got a new phone but still required me to start up the game with WiFi then i can play on data. very annoying.",

They do not follow their own rules.  They do not compensate players for their mistakes.  They let Chinese player buy packs cheaper and use at accounts.  If you are a Westerner do not play or pay on this game.  Their customer service sucks.  They actually try to get you to feel sorry for them.  Its amazing.  They will only steal from you.",
        "This is definitely a pay to win game.  And I agree with previous reviews saying it favors Chinese players.  The developers claim it's not, but if it wasn't true, then why are 99% of the servers dominated by Chinese players?  Plus the Chinese to English translations are terrible.  You will barely understands what they're saying.",

Like things that have been improved on in this genre of game in other apps are still frustrating here. Oh well, what can I expect from a freemium game? Overall it's enjoyable but I have to take it in doses; basically until I get frustrated by the gameplay or other players. All in all, there are worse was to spend your time."

        "I wasnt sure about this series at first, but it's really grown on me. The unique art style, interesting characters and immersive world make this an incredible game, especially considering it's a free mobile app! I would definitely love to see more sims like this in the future, (especially with the bad boy type). Seeing it transfer to desktop would be awesome! Overall, everything about this game is wonderful but, like everyone else says, the amount of energy given for free isn't enough! I think it would be wise to either lower the cost of energy actions take, give more free energy out, or split the story into parts in which 1 part can be played for free each day. Other than that it's a great sim!",
        "My absolute favorite of all of the Is it Love games. Colin is an amazing character with an equally amazing backstory, and the way he connects with the MC is just incredible. The twists and turns in each chapter leave me craving more of the story. The energy they give you is somewhat lacking, but I'm used to it by now. Highly reccomend!",
        "Really don't like how the guy treats the girl, what a scumbag! Plus I've been playing for over a week and the plot is unbelievably slow, the energy doesn't last long enough. There are much better otome style games out there.",
        "Well the energy situation is beyond annoying. You only get very little for free and the prices for the energy and just WAY too expensive. I do like the story a lot though and will probably take 8 years to complete the story so I don't have to pay 50 bucks",
        "OK, so I absolutely agree with everyone that the energy you get for free is nowhere near enough & packages are too expensive for what you get. I know, I've bought many. This story particular started bad, but now that I'm at the end, I'm hooked. Please continue to update. I have lots of bought energy going to waste!!",
        "I don't really like the concept of earning energy every 24 hours. But I've got to say every time i see that message when my energy runs out. It leaves me on a cliffhanger and it keeps me in the story. Even if the energy wasn't there i would still play the game to my hearts content! Overall AMAZING story and characters!!"

        "First off to all those saying too many ads, there aren't any ads. What you're seeing is game packs that can be purchased to help you advance within the game. I love the game. Everythingis great. I just wish they would give everyone time to adjust to previous items before creating something new. And also the pricingis too high. $20-$50 is fine but $99 is way too much.",
        "This game has become a cash cow for the developers at MZ. New features are added making the game more complex and diverse weekly. Costing players money. While old features players are familiar with and depend on break down  After contacting MZ you get a nice form letter stating thank you for bringing it to there attention but they hope you understand these things take time to fix.",
        "This game should be awesome, but the updates just come too fast now. I bought 2 packs this week and still got zeroed as soon as i dropped shield. By the time you spend 2 days clicking upgrades, someone is stronger than you and just waiting for you to try to use your new stuff.",
        "This game was fun about two years ago before MZ started trying to milk players each month for money.  If you buy a package from them,  which ranges from $14.99 to $399.99, make sure you get what you pay for. ..many times you don't get everything they promise; especially with the BOGO packages.   MZ will do little if anything to correct the matter.  Also, even after you spend tons of money, if you wait long enough they will give you the same stuff for free to all players.   My advice...find another game to play. ..something more fun and worthwhile. ..and not sponsored by MZ.",
        "If you want to be at top of this game then be prepared to spend more than the price of a top end BMW in one year. I am not kidding. MZ releases major game changing upgrades every day for several $99.99 packs. Then you get tge worst customer support in the industry. Terrible software quality control and business practices that mirror drug cartels.",
        "Mz took a once decent game and ruined it.  The weekly changes are senseless change is to be gradual.  Im finally walking away.  Im done with ur bots, done with admin accts and done with daily chances.  More and more people have quit and droves more will follow.  Choke on the money u got from all  of the foolish people who actually paid.  You deserve none of it"

        "Very pricy game with limited game play. You will spend a lot of money to advance. There is no other reasonable way to play. Too many moderators/players( they play for free) who steal/destroy resources causing you to spend even more money. The game is a money pit. Stay away.",
        "Please fix the launch. I cant log in. i have reinstalled it multiple times. If it is a maintenance thing or update,shouldnt you at least talk about it in your facebook page or forum?If I lose my account because of this....",
        "To compete even fairly with the others, it's either you SPEND TONS OF MONEY or play the game for a long time, patience is needed here (not even joking, grind hard, pray hard for rng).  While it's a P2W game, I assure you it is fun and addicting for just casual play. Lots of contents in the game to keep you playing.  Finally, DEAR DEVELOPERS kindly reduce the stamina consumption and the number of soul stones needed for raising stars. This helps us, casual players, a lot."

I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and installed and nothing. It just sits on the opening screen, sadly I will have to delete. Wish I didn't have to but it's just wasting space on my phone now. Otherwise, I did enjoy it.",
        "Its completely pay to play. You have to use diamonds to expand your land, but you can't earn them. You have to buy them with real money. It would be a problem if you could buy a small amount for like $0.99... But the minimum is $10 Its ridiculous.",
        "I would love the game,if there was really something to do, no interaction,from what I've read this is a useless app.i got on after the update today,and my screen is blank except for my buildings,the scenery is gone,black! I am on a mobile and can't use any of the great functions everyone talks about. I can't even help my team,totally disappointed,that's for sure. And I've spent quite a bit of money. I am so bored.Theres only a couple things to enjoy on it.Come on ,why can't you get this game together for Android users?",
        "Playing on the phone app. I am disappointed that I cannot play the full version. I cannot send messages to my fellowship members, I cannot see their cities, I cannot participate in the events with my teammates. All I am doing all day every day is trying to build up resources for upgrades, and those are high compared with how much you can make. You cannot earm free diamonds, and many of the buildings you cannot get without them. Will rate higher when these things are improved.",
        "The game is beautiful, but its a bit to complicated. And the in app purchases are rediculus. I'd love it if you could actually advance in the games. There are just too many things needed to advance in the slightest. It's too bad cuz the game it has great graphics.",
        "Game is great. Love building games. Only letdown is that is pay-to-win. It would be better if non-paying players would have little more easy time with game, like give more builders at least... 😉"

        "This is a great game. It's fun, addictive, and a great time killer. The only problem I see is that I created an account on the game thinking it would save. WRONG! I had to do a factory reset on my phone and now I have to start over. I was so far with some really good cards, but alas I know more about the game now, so maybe I'll get there quicker this time.",
        "Don't bother downloading this game.  The customer service in this game is terrible.  I submitted a ticket because several combinations i researched in game disappeared.  I got a response that the game would fix itself and my ticket was being closed.  The problem didn't fix itself and i can't remember every combo lost. I submitted another ticket and I'm waiting for a response but after how my first ticket was handled I'm not confident they'll fix it. I've only been playing a few days but if the game is this buggy already then i don't recommend downloading it.",
        "It's actually surprisingly fun. The card mechanics are simple to grasp but with a enough depth to keep you trying new decks and combos. I chuckled a few times at some of the dialouge between the characters. 10/10 would recommend",
        "The game is addictive, but in short it's a gamble for cards. The prices are a lot for what you are getting. Lots of repetitive challenges. Unfortunately the quest for cards is really a quest for your wallet. I played since 9/16 and decided to walk away. Unfortunately you get to a point where the only way to move up is to spend, spend, spend. The gambling pulls for cards on real money game currency got old.",
        "The main problem with the game in my opinion is being able to attack your opponent while they have other cards in play. Perhaps if you could choose to block rather than be forced to take it the game would be a bit better aa youd have to manage your resources a bit better rather than beat hard until its over. Aside from that it is a very fun game to play",
        "Waste of money. No matter what you spend you never get decent cards. They stack the odds so no matter how you buy cards you'll always get ripped off. Mom's box is supposedly random yet I've bought hundreds of boxes I've never got anything worth a damn. I've played over a year and wasted a hundred bucks on this game w no reward. I strongly recommend you don't spend a dollar on this game. It won't help. The game will still screw you. Money will not help on this game."

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

        "Not a bad game but it's typical like some other games. It starts off with the levels being super easy, letting you build your confidence to get you thinking you're really good.  Now I understand the higher the levels the more difficulty there is but not to the point where they make it almost impossible trying to get you to buy more chances. Another words they're trying to get you to pay to win and advance not necessarily on skill level. Very sneaky. Uninstalling. It's fun for a while but overall I do not recommend.",

        "Love this game, but it freezes up. I go to try and reinstall it after a few days but it won't let me reinstall the game. Just stays at the same  level last completed. Still having the problem of when having to reinstall I lose all my lives and charms. Love the game but hate ,owing all my lives and charms",
        "The update took me from level 400 back to level 1 very upset be first I wasn't getting my daily play rewards so I figured like everything else it may need to update and the update blow my whole progress. I'm so pissed is there a way to fix this?",
        "I actually enjoyed the game and would give it four or five stars except 200 coins and multiple items were taking away simply because I got logged out if Facebook. Also several levels were lost.... This I understand, glitches happen. What I don't understand and don't accept is the lack of response from the developer. I've sent several emails and have yet to get a non automated response.",
        "I installed the game about 3 times and gave up. Can't connect with Facebook and when playing it suddenly stop and say it's not responding."

        "Overall great game as far as playing is concerned. Major thing that could use work is matchmaking. Currently an 89 overall getting matched against 98-105 overall players. No chance to win and may discourage some people from playing the game. The gameplay is awesome and I have lots of fun, 100% worth your time if you avoid Head-to-head or tournaments (unless you have money or don't mind being poorly matched).",
        "This is my full honest review. Madden Mobile is back!! I'll admit before it was not fun and I complained that you need to pay to win but EA really did good when I came back to play. The game is fun and is somewhat easy to get 100 overall players and now they are bringing back Draft Champs and I have seen early drafts and it looks great. The promos are great. I would like to say great job EA on bringing this game back and making it fun. I always want to play everyday and build my Ultimate Team",
        "I have played this game for 3 seasons now.  I can't even begin to say all that is wrong, but one of the things that stands out most to me, is that your players stats mean nothing.  You spend a lot of time and effort completing events and grinding, and improve your team only to find out that when you play a team way below your level, it seems that that teams players are much faster and tend to play way above their ability.  this game seems to have the liberal bug that everyone is equal.  I am done with this game, don't get caught up with it, it's not worth the waste of your time",
        "Thanks alot EA for this new head to head style. Great to know that all the grinding and work put in is only allowing those who have a 100 overall or better reap the rewards. Everytime playing one of these individuals they have a counter for every single play. This really turns me off to the game.",
        "For the person hoping to find Madden 18, this is the closest thing you are gonna get. Yes, it doesn't have practice mode or my player mode, but it DOES have a incredible roster of players that you bargain for. The graphics are pretty good for a game on a smartphone.  Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE for NFL fans. 10 outta 10.",
        "You know I really like all of the Live Events but when I get these old collectible cards that aren't worth anything I have to cut them one by one. It takes way too long and I've got over a hundred. I would suggest having a way to group delete or in Madden terms \"cut\" the old dead weight."

Sure there is a point where there is a wall, but at least you know your one of the strongest. Plus it makes me want to climb that wall, and topple whales.",
        "Maybe one of the best games that still let you play to win. You can get everything with enough patience and a little luck. If you do want to pay though, it's gonna be pretty expensive and the stuff you get does not really let you advance a lot (unless you actually spend A LOT of money).",
        "+ Easy to play + Good story line + Also easy to get the items + I like the game mechanic  - Need more challenging on battle - Need table of hero type - Inventory items don't include the gear being use  Overall i like this game, very good. Also, more hero will make this game more good. And... adding charge chain attack will be awesome  Edit: After update my account was lost, please fix it",
        "This game is great. It doesnt beat you over the head with paywalls, you could probably play f2p and still have a ton of fun. Graphics are good and mechanics are deep and satisfying. Only complaint is the reddit coommunity, but cant blame the devs for that.",
        "Previous rating was 👍👍. Now 👍.  Content drought at the end of the game with some very expensive in app purchases. End game is killing the same dragon or farming the same level over and over and over...there are daily tasks which are a chore. Hoping for quality of life improvements similar to what the reddit suggests.   I really like the art style.",
        "Great game with the most responsive and generous developers.  The only thing bad about this game is the toxic gaming community.  Full of unjustifiable whiners who are so poor they need their freebies for EVERY event or else they have a hissy fit and threaten to quit game AND also cry koz of nerfs on their heroes and threaten to quit(but really don't). They also attack every person who does spend for the game (casual spender or whale) God-forbid the devs need to also earn for a living."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks.",
        "This game will cheat you! I  upgraded a bunch of my characters but the next time I logged in nothing had saved! The funds I used to upgrade were also gone, of course. Don't waste money buying anything because the upgrades you make just disappear."

        "Nice Game! At the start its easy, like many players said, but maybe they didnt stick through to further their games,I believe the easy start is needed to build for the later part of the games specially if you are a f2p player. Though being F2P isnt as bad here as it is on other games (speaking from experience). I like thier new updates now and specially the \"sweep\" requirement. Thanks Devs! my only hope is that please make planting/ crops a little easier on us common folks,it gets a little bit tiring to have to press from seed&gt;plant repeat (depending on your available field). Anyway, besides this i do not regret playing the game, easy controls, f2p friendly, graphics is good, controls are good. Keep up the good work devs!looking forward to more updates",
        "For the love of God let me grammar check your game...",
        "Very nice and addictive game, i like it.  Would be nicer if pvp is already availble",
        "Nice game. I just hope more free diamonds to be given during quests :)",
        "I love the game but what happened to pk cus you guys are an different company",
        "Downloaded the game just to see LoL heroes like Ahri and Sona on action only to found out most of them in preview screenshots doesn't exist in-game. But overall a fun game and f2p friendly.  Edit: upped my rating to 5 after 5 days playing, you guys deserve it. Keep up the good work. :)"

        "Would be 5 stars if I could get back into the game. Have tried uninstalling but it still keeps crashing after the loading screen. A Mikaela screen comes up with a Start Download button and it crashes on this screen.  Update: I can't login on your website to log a ticket with your support team.",
        "I do miss the old LOA - Fire Raider style of art and play, just came back after maybe a year or so and it was gone! But, Paradise seems pretty cool so far, only thing I'm not a big fan of is how everything deals with irl money while in the 'old' one you could build up gems or materials for certain things like VIP levels; also I heard about rewards being given to old players like me? That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",
        "Gave you people an opportunity to fix the stupid chibi icon characters. The latest update didn't fix that so uninstalled.  Also do not reply with a generic response cause you can kiss my ass",
        "Only challenging for nonpaying playing. Not a big fan of pay to win games. But LoA is always addicting and just makes you want to spend your money. Not suitable if you're addicted to that overall. More nonpaying support would be reasonable for them to at least be able to compete.",
        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",
        "I'm getting tired trying to make the in game download to download it keeps saying that it couldn't download it try a different line everytime I get to 18 or 17 please help me... It's not my network so don't say it's my network.. I tried restarting the game that only makes it worst I really want to play this game."

        "Well this is not a grate game this game is FANTASTIC  !!! Haven't seen any adds in over two weeks I've been playing it. I think they asked, but I came all by myself to rate it because its a grate game! Gorgeous graphics, controls are excellent, music is good  and most of all its quite interesting! Way to go people ! Thank you! Came back to update on my experience with this game. Over a month paying no  surprises, no adds, no asking to rate it just wonderful. Challenging at times than easyer and so on. Congratulations to the creators of this game and keep up the grate job!!! I am at the level 126!",
        "I am at level 218, since the recent update I am unable to play, screen goes to loading the level them just keeps loading, I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times with the same result. There's a glitch that I wish would be fixed before I decide to uninstall for good. Lost all of my gold bars, all of my cherries upon reinstall. It's a shame.",
        "Used to love this game. Now game is too difficult. Have to repeat level over and over again to move on. It is no longer fun to struggle at each level. That is frustrating...not relaxing.",
        "AHHHH ONCE AGAIN AN UPDATE THAT WIPED OUT EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED FOR.  SOMEDAY YOU'LL FIX THAT BUG!  It's better than any of the others despite bugs.",
        "Use to love it but shuts down every time I try to play lately!  Also have never been able to pick apples always says oops try again!",
        "I lost  300+ gold & 700+ cherries after the game crushed last night. worst update ever   UPDATE 20 MAR: Would you please add a comfirm message when using 10 golds for play on? I have to restart  saving for  golds after the evil update, and I just lost all the 40 golds by wiping play on accidently due to slow respones of the game."

I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",

Also, when making moves the move I make is not the move that happens. Also, when watching the video for the xtra coin: when the video ends the game restarts taking me back to tohome screen to press play to enter back into the game.. Thank you loyal player!!",
        "The sound effects of the tornado is kind of frightening but I don't fear because all the characters are near as I ease on down the road. The characters interactions will assist if I follow the yellow brick road. \"I can't wait to meet the wizard\" I believe I'm going to be granted more golden bricks to extend the yellow brick road. I'm curious like a lion. Lol. The best for the whole family. Thanks!",
        "This is by far the greatest game that I've ever played! A lot of my friends play as well, so I  can enjoy playing for a long time. Caution: Very addictive game!!! I find it hard to stop playing once I start. This is one app that you're going to want to download if you want to have some fun.",
        "I use to enjoy playing this game.  Lately though, there are less power ups to achieve and more of the movie tickets.  I would rather have the power ups than the tickets.  This is why I am changing the rating I previously gave of 5 stars to 3.  Also, you should really have more of the Glenda versus the Wicked Witch challenges.",
        "Great game but I really wish that daily rewards are better. It used to be you would get a crystal ball often, money and other things that to help with game, but lately it has been stuoid little rewards like two coins or one row clear. What happened to good rewards for players that come on every day and expect to get a little help in the game play",
        "I love this game except for ONE big aggravation.   When you win extended life you don't get to choose when to use it.  It starts immediately and sometimes you've been playing to complete a sprint or another section and you CANT play another two hours.   That means you lose that extra time.   Today I've lost a 3 hour extra play and now I'm about to lose another 2 hour play.   Very Annoying!"

        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance",
        "It's a great game where you can race and customise your own car. However here are some ideas I would like you the imlament please  1. If the cars from the NASCAR can get the custmizeing like all the others.   2. To extend the custmize can yo add a tab where you can put spoilers, air intakes And other things you would put on a car.  3. Finally to make this game real racing 3 if when a race of just go to see all the car you have.  There be a \"i\" button that will give the player real information about the car the player is looking at."

        "I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I have to say, I didn't have high hopes when I started. 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop and I wanted to play more. It's a different take on a Final Fantasy game, and it really does feel like a Dissidia game in RPG form. The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

        "I am only giving ABF a 3 right now. I have played ABF since the beginning of it's time. I feel as if the coin rewards are very slim in the higher leagues. I am a Diamond Star 4 and I feel as if the higher the level the higher the reward but, the rewards are all the same. When you work your way up you want to feel rewarded! If coin rewards increase in the higher levels so will my rating!!!!!",
        "I would give it 5 stars, but they've changed a few things. It's now more difficult to earn coins for power-ups. So in order to win the tournaments, they've put people in the position of having to make purchases more often. Needless to say, I don't play as often anymore. I've also noticed that several of my friends don't play anymore either. Too bad, the game used to be a lot more fun.",
        "Been playing this game for years. Loved it in the beginning.  Seems the lower I rate the game as they try to make easier for people that are not good.  the birds I throw are nearly useless a lot of times compared to playing the same game for a star 2 player I know. And now the game is crashing constantly. Wish I could sell the nearly 100,000 bird coins I have. Seems I won't need them.",
        "Ok so when there is an issue that needs addressed, sometimes it take a couple of days for the tech people to get to it. But overall the game is awesome! This is the only game that I still play every day from the time I got a smart phone, which has been several years!",
        "I love playing angry birds friends. I'm an adult woman and have played since they came out with the game. Scoring in first place many times. Recently there seems to be too much graphics and sometimes using plays from other games or other angry birds games. If people are submitting what they have thought out, please make sure it stays within original angry birds friends game. Some levels are too far out there.",
        "I loved this game to keep in touch with a few friends but please take those stupid Dignity ads off... They do not close and always end up missing up my game. I have to close the game out and start all over. Loosing many power ups and coins in this tedius game making it more frustrating than fun."

        "A well made app that's immersive, addictive, and the essence of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. The app is mission based and has a complex but easy to use medal system with rock-paper-scissors type of combat. You can join/make a party, or go solo. Money isn't an issue so long as you pace yourself. It gets better the more you play. There are optional event quests and a story, but don't fret if you can't get the app or just starting out; it's slow going. 735 quests.",
        "Liking the cute art style but my god does this game take forever to download even with a low resolution. Has taken me two attempts and I'm doubtful that it's related to my broadband speed and connection (not sure if it's to do with my phone? But again, doubtful.) Would be great if this could be fixed somehow.",
        "I freaking love this game! However I have a small complaint that is probably fixable. I was wondering for my lg g6 if you could expand the borders so the screen would fit. And if the screen is not able to get any bigger, I'm hoping you people can at least put a cool border around it instead of leaving it as a black bar. I know you people can make cool borders. Thanks for your attention!",
        "Hey guys, huge fan of the kingdom hearts series and also the game in general. Though one thing I wish you could add is the option to link your data to your Google Play account as well as Facebook. Not a lot of us use Facebook so I wish there was more options to get your data back if you ever deleted the app. Otherwise, good game!",
        "I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn't really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.",
        "[Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!"

So far, and I am a budding designer myself and I will keep this one as long as they support it and update it... Aces, review by Da1 G Reaper of the Sun Tzu Ghosts Gaming Community... #livfreeplyhard #STGGC",
        "Good luck in this game if ya don't want to spend money. No game balancing meaning a lvl12 can attk lvl  1 with no post attk shield or protection of any kind. Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",
        "Hi A.K server 52. Have been playing for couple of months now and still love the game.just when you think you are on top of things something new comes up. I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",

        "This game has a great support department, they try their best to resolve all issues that come up in the game quickly.  I love playing this game it has some of the most fantantic story lines and great graphics.  Again I would like to thank all the staff at My Tona makers of Seekers Notes and especially Amy Smith for all her help. Trina   P.S. I would like for the makers of the game to make the COINS available towards the purchase of RUBIES - either at the bank or in TRADE at one of the shops, I have $2,509,310.00 at this time and still accumulating, I never use that much at the shops.",
        "Deceptively simple it's very enjoyable and a little addictive. Challenging enough to keep me interested it can be a little frustrating that is not as generous as it could be with producing items needed but it's not so slow to produce as to put me off. Love the challenges and find the interaction with friends is simple. After the most recent update I noted a lot of complaints but these all seem to have been addressed by the developers.",
        "Only just got going on the game and so far it's a pleasant way to pass the time. I'm guessing it could end up costing a bit as some items are so hard to find!",
        "Love this game! Updates are just frequent enough that I can complete the missions before the next update without getting behind or waiting too long for the next update. Also good about listening to feedback",
        "I REALLY like this game! The only two issues I have is that 1) some times I'll click on a (correct) item while playing the game and it won't accept it so I'll click it again and then it deducts 10 seconds and I'll have to click it AGAIN and it'll do ally accept it. I also don't like that when I'm completing a collection if I already have an item in the collection, it won't let me skip finding it and still makes me play the level to find it, even though I already have it. It wastes my energy and that's annoying. Other than those 2 things this game is AH-AMAZING! And super addictive.",
        "Need tutorials more often during the game for fuller enjoyment."

I'll give more stars when this issue is fixed... until then if you don't wanna lose your money die to crashes and glitches DO NOT INSTALL!   Update , I wish I could give negative Stars,  it is continuously CRASHING if my troops die due to FAILURE which is caused by the developers faulty upkeep this time, I'll quit and never play another game made by this company again!  SIMPLY FIX THE ISSUES ON YOUR GAME OR REDUND OUR MONEY, YA CROOKS!!!!!!😠😠😠😠😡",

        "Addictive and engrossing game.  The bonus covers work well. The constant character tweaking and release rate makes the vs progression awards with wins is very good.  The favorites is a good way to let folks focus on building certain characters.  The transition points are still frustrating, especially when you get a run of bad luck with tokens.  Tokens might work better if they scaled instead. Biggest issue is progression awards in versus and the tough transitions in levels.",
        "I have been playing this game for a few years now and love it! But a little suggestion... Because of the time I've spent playing it and the already difficult ability to get 4 and 5 star characters, I have nearly 3 million iso-8 that I literally cannot spend. Please add a way to convert iso-8 into hero points or command points!!! I'd like to get further in the game instead of literally stockpiling iso-8. This has all been done without spending a single dollar on the game too, btw",
        "This is an awesome, addictive and hyper fun game. Brilliant idea and concept. In all the games I have played this is the first I have spent money on. VIP member. Have a couple suggestions for developer tho. Can you add abilities to swap covers with alliance members and maybe add as a bonus drop for playing, an extra free slot. Keep up the brilliant work. Truely love this game.",
        "This is my go-to game. Day and night. It's fun, simple and sometime challenging. My only complaint is that i have like a million of Iso-8 and don't know what to do with them. My thought would be that if we don't need so much Iso-8, be sweet to give some to aliance member who needs it or so on. Great game. Don't know what I'd do without it!",
        "Suitable for all age groups, Marvel Puzzle Quest is a great game for everyone. Progress with higher tier characters may be slow but yet significant. The wide variety of heroes and villians within the game allows for endless possibilities of the \"best team\". Highly addictive, I would recommend this perfect game to anyone and everyone.",
        "Love that they are always adding new characters. Would like to see some different characters like Cable, Domino, Sabretooth, and Bishop just to name a few. Just because they don't have a movie... Would also like to see some new events, new animations, and less repetitiveness. Love the collection part and finally being able to use characters when you've finally built their powers enough. Love that it can be played for free. Love that feedback is read and the game is constantly evolving.Thanks."

After players matching ,game is hacked/stopped by several times.Only way to win that kind of match,any of one player has to quit or network issues.Its waste of time,also harm for devices (battery drainage,high heating). So,admin plz look after these prob.Why it's hanging or hacking.",
        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "Could you please enable the user to save his progress in a Gmail account??  So that, when you lost or change your phone, you can recover the level and progress you had before instead of restarting from the beginning!!!!!!!!!!!!   If you could allow more media for sharing the game, it would be better, Facebook is not the only social media!!   And sometimes, it bugs!! Sometimes, the game is very slow and causes you to lose. Indeed, you shoot but the ball goes after many seconds even though the connexion is good!! Consequently you loose against a weak player, And this makes very angry!!!   Should those problems fixed, I will rate 5 stars.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person."

        "The game itself is wonderful, but I've had this bug ever since Chapter 2 or 3 (I just finished Chapter 12) where when I finish the final level, the screen goes black and won't play the cutscene. I end up having to close the game and never get to see it, then I go into the next Chapter not really knowing what's going on. The story is important to me and it's very unfortunate that this is happening. A fix from the developers or a suggestion on something I can do would be greatly appreciated.",

Don't like waiting the 4 hours to regain energy and I would gladly watch ads to be able to fill my energy. It would be nice to have a larger expansion area while needing the same requirements. Love the speciality collections!  Great job!",

You should patch the game after some time, after you have the revenue. Cars not even look like they \"look\" in the real life. The gameplay is alright so far, might become enjoyable for a longer gameplay.   Just started, but I wasn't suggested to invite my friends to play. Correct it also for making the community larger. Where is the option to play with my friends? Also, any crew creator option? So far , 4/5. Started yesterday",

        "I liked the game but the reason its a 4 is because on the 0 to 150 races i have a car that its high is 157 mph but it just randomly stops at 134 and says dnf my car is way faster plz fix the Chevrolet Impala 1967 and my Chevrolet Camero 1970 can make it to 145 mph on a mile drag but cant make it to 130 mph on a 0 to 150 race, thats bs plz fix these cars' top speeds plz. They r broken",
        "Great game, constantly playing, was crashing this morning but fixed now so up to 5 stars.  Would like more ways to make money once the campaign is 100% complete, maybe more, or replayable campaigns, or new game modes all together, but still great fun.",
        "Since yesterday I can't even the game anymore keeps crashing right after the loading screen I wish that a lot of money on this game if it's not working properly I will complain"

One last thing, the co-op mode has some bug where u created the room but unable to start the game even when u have enough player. Please fix that, thank you.",
        "I think it's a good game. Suck that you have to pay money to go up against other people that already have SS Hero's. Just wanted to say y'all should make at least more S hero's that are FTP so y'all can get people to get back into the game I don't want this game to die off.",
        "The game is really addictive. Hours of game play and activities. I really like it. However, since it's international the time for coop game should be more flexible so i can join with my friends at suitable time. Tournament matching is a little bit unbalanced, either it's a raid or it's a total defeat. And heroes skills should  give more details on stats, so we can plan effectively. Thank you for such a good game.",
        "They are about to make it more of a money trap with an update that screws f2p and budgeted p2w. They say they have free events and events so part time p2w have fun. Then why are people talking about quitting? These are high paying players. I know you plan on making it so hero's bought for special skills like stun and silence won't work if there's a big gap. You've made it so hero's bought for the purpose of moving these budgeted p2w are useless. So it's in favor of real p2w. It should be a reverse. Make the lower people have a better chance not a worse one.",

        "the new fusion medals added make it so you can not fuse heros without spending money this game is officially broken theres no free way to advance anymore dont download. its very sad i like the idea behind the medals but whos going to grind with 0 progress for 8 months and still not get thier first 6 star .... its messed up",
        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

        "Really entertaining story. Great tactics gameplay and characters. I enjoyed this much more than I expected. Steve Jobs said, good artists borrow but great artists steal and I feel that that is what this game did. Very heavy Naruto vibe with Logi and Dias. Then of course,  the Full Metal Alchemist feel with alchemy and the door of truth and leaving part of your body on the other side of the door in order to gain power. 7 kingdoms, 7 deadly sins. This had a good animated opening and song. This game has been very entertaining and I'm looking forward to the next episode to see what happens next. Good stuff, Gumi.",
        "Quite unique game with active players who already experienced the japanese version. UI needs lots of improvements, my goodness! Like Units page must have a back button, and be available not only when going back from Home (Talk abt inconvenience). Loot pieces on-hand should be available when newly acquired loots are pressed and hold! Screen transition also needs optimization for faster reaction.",
        "So far I have only been playing the game for a few hrs. The graphics are sharp and the controls are easy to learn. My only complaint is you can't turn the camera a complete 360 to get a better look at where you opponents are. Other than that it's a great game. Closest thing to Final Fantasy Tactics on Android. Love it.",
        "Best Turn based tactic game. You dont need to be a whale to be good bcos of10% \"rainbow\" summon chance. The stage and event is quite challenging. The only problem is MULTIPLAY. Please make the player can switch between private (code) room to public so that if we only wait for 1 friend, we can switch to public to fill the other 2 slots. It is because if we go to public there is a high chance our friend cannot enter our room bcos of full slots. And then force us to disband and recreate room over and over just to make our friend enter our room.",
        "Game is SUPERB, however it will be awesome if devs could implement following suggestion 1. Quest mission pop up is super annoying if we want to manually farm the equipment in the story mission. 2. Try again mission should be automatically enter the dungeon instead of choosing the team formation. 3. Auto go option, so player can easily farm the dungeon.",
        "Great VAs and story. What I mostly disliked is how slow the combat is even with the accelerated mode, to grind materials it can be quite annoying if you lack skip tickets. I hope they add an option to skip combat animation soon."

        "This is just amazing! Once you get started it gets a little tough, but you can have other people help you if your stuck. I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",
        "I absolutely love this game, and have never had any issues with it. but today it froze on the loading screen when connecting to an online match, I had to force restart my phone and now everytime I try to start the app it stays stuck on the loading screen until it times out. I love this game please fix so I can continue playing and rate 5 stars.",
        "I'm only putting it as one star in hopes the devs see this, but please find a better way to recover accounts. I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out."

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I've really enjoyed reading All the Wrong reasons.  The author is very talented, a true story teller.  As I was reading I felt like part of the story I was so enveloped in the lives of the characters they were alive and real. I was sad when the story ended wanted to keep reading.  I was overjoyed when K. I. S. S.  came out by that very sane author who transported me to a whole new world yet again. I look forward to reading more from this amazingly talented storyteller!!",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked."

Hey people try the link I was given  05.12.2017 My app setup it's on my quick lunch to do the force stop after every 3-4 game moves. Left the game for 10 min to get going still frozen.

        "Well like every game they will trying to grind you and empty your pokets. Buut as gamers with brains we can enjoy the game without waisting money. Its like second world you can meet people and do things with them. I hope they will creat an update that we can realy feel like alive. Than just standing like a wall and only chating. Anyway its simmiler to sims. Give it a try",
        "I love the game, its a great way to hook up with friends. I have one request though. The streaming music is a great idea but I was wondering if u could add in a feature that lets u type in the song u want to hear. I be very happy if u did and even more excited to play this. Edit: also could u pls include a choice to exchange diamonds for coins cause the amount grows fast while ur coins go down at the same speed & it pisses me off",
        "The tapjoy didnt work. What the hell. I played the counting cats and spelling bee and i scored 70% and there's no reward even after 24 hours. If i made a report there, you would simply give me a copy messages and ignored it. What a waste of time",
        "I love the game but with every update it seems to be more problems with mystery box. The videos don't play at all or no reward and these are the non mini game videos. Please fix the game. I will change my rating back to five stars when I can play like when I first started playing. OMG now I can't even log in this is getting frustrating.",
        "Idk, if others are not able to join social spots or message friends or do pretty much anything if your on android. Cuz for me I got nothing this started right after I made a purchase of the second build machine. Ever since then NOTHING has worked EDIT: SOME of these things work but usernames and other things are no longer showing up! Please fix but otherwise great Social game!",
        "I like decorating the houses they are beautiful. I just wish the music from the music streaming stereos doesnt stop when we edit or open a window. It kind of starting all over again whenever that happens. Also the mystery boxeswont open after watching some adverts. Pls fix it. I like this game except the boring part people dont usually chat a lot. But overall this game is ok coz its on the go."

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

        "I love this game! But, there's not enough energy or chances to win energy or earn it. 10 isnt enough!There's times when I'm out of energy and have done everything I can do and have to leave the game but still feel like playing. I've spent money on this game but I don't always have money to buy energy or coins to buy energy. There should be more give-a-ways, prizes, little games, etc to earn more energy so I can keep playing!! Also, I'd like to be able to friend request other players and send them things. Like people on my team on here.  Thank you! Lynn Mauger",
        "Amazing! It is an amazing game that you go and figure out the death of somebody. You go through stages and different areas and you must find hidden objects. You get coins and bucks that you spend on things to make your world. Great time taker.",
        "There are quite a few objects that are incorrectly identified. For example, there is a screen used for changing clothes behind, but it is what you need to find when asked for a \"lamp.\"  The pace is not good. In gameplay, you collect coins used for buying decorations. You have to place decorations to advance the gameplay. But if you have no coins and are at an impasse in the gameplay because you need decorations, you're stuck unless you lay down real cash.  A lot of the problems the developer is aware of, because their next game like this, June's Journey, is much better.",
        "For some reason the game is frozen and won't  go past  the wooga screen it is also doing it on  June's  Journey  please fix because I  really  like  to  play these games",
        "I really like it. It's something different every time your finding new things same things different order etc lots of fun",
        "Very addictive. Not enough hours in the day."

        "FIRST OF ALL (and this is from my first review) why did it ask me if yhis was a skateboarding game, a role play game or a happy game? Its just funny second up the graphics a bit and lastly i like the call of duty mixed with clash of clans and have its own mechanics",
        "Great graphics good game play. The only problem I have is that there needs to be a base building button it's a pain with the current set-up. Also the rotation of the screen isn't really necessary I don't use it at all. Other than that great game hope you keep improving it",
        "For once, just for once, Activision, please release an update that is bug free. The recent update to 4.6.0 basically renders the war screen useless. On opening the war screen, the game bugs out. Any attempt to fall back to main base layout or to try to go to war overview is useless and it is stuck in the war overlay. Apparently we lost an Alliance war that we would have easily won, thanks to your \"competent\" developers releasing such \"wonderful\" updates.",
        "It's slow paced but has it's moments, graphics are decent for the style of game but the micro transactions are brutal.  Overall fun game but unless  you buy your way up its going to take a LONG time before you are any good",
        "I like the app overall but it can be confusing at times. That could very well be because I don't pay attention to the game sometimes. ❤ an overall 4⭐⭐⭐⭐.",
        "Love the game. One of the best app games out there. Wish you could use apple id accounts with it as well as Google's on an Android device other than that game is sickness"

        "DO NOT buy play in this game, it randomly disappears. I had 1.2 billion coins & my whole account disappeared today. I was playing earlier then shut it down for 15 minutes. Next time I opened the game it was at the welcome page for new players. The game logo on my phone shows I have 32 saved charms...which I can't access...cuz my account (& money) is gone.",
        "Not as fun as it use to be. Payouts SUCK lately for the amount of coins I use. Unfair. Took the fun out of it. Not cool to loyal players. Mistake 1 - do not EVER purchase coins!! Update - 2/8 Game has been a bit better last few days. Getting better since upgrade!!! Getting better & better!!!! Love it!!!",
        "Can i please have some money to play with. I need big money. I dont get enough to play big. More money pleeeeese i play everyday all day 😭😭😭😭",
        "I have played this game close to a year now and I love it more and more! Great games and fair payouts! I would recommend Hit It Rich to any slot lover!",
        "Of all the casino apps I've used, Hit it rich is my favorite,  plenty of free coins and fun to play. Great job to the folks at Hit it rich.",
        "Not enough coins to many problems that take way to long to fix need to give more coins and on the bonus it most of times stops on  5  don't like the way you have to unlock your favorite game to play need to put the games back like they were and stop doing these road games and challenges also reels dropping to fast on spins very disappointed that you are putting the Christmas games up I love playing some of them boo"

        "I do like the game because it is fun.  The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is challenging; however, the new update includes an option to purchase updates to units by way of credits, alloy, and crystals.  The wording is not specific and I wasted quite a bit of crystals, credits and alloy and did not receive what I thought I purchased.  Although I am unhappy and will most likely NOT make any further purchases in this game in the future, it is still worth a try.  Just make sure you do not make the same mistake I did.  I do hope the developer reads this and makes the appropriate chsnges.  Enjoy.",
        "Loved it to begin with and spent a lot of actual money to progress...... but it only helped a little, you have to have deep pockets or too much time to get anywhere. Oh and now it's crashed, having to re install just to see if I've lost all my money!",
        "I gave 2 stars.  I used to like this game but not anymore. I am lvl 7 and the only people who ever hit me are lvl 10 bases!!! What is up with that? Don't give me some bs excuse is because regardless, this is not right and I am thinking of quitting because of this.  I'm a paying customer but I won't be spending another dime on this lopsided game.  Thanks for stealing my cash and my time.",
        "Would definitely give at least 4 stars, but there's one thing that really makes me mad: The Attacking/Defending Algorithm. Out my entire squad, I have the least attacks, but I'm the leader, by far, in defenses. I don't WANT to attack anyone yet. I want to farm and get stronger. But I can't do that if I'm getting attacked 7-10 times every hour. Even when I win defenses, I still lose resources. Fix that. Make it to where people that rarely attack, are rarely attacked.",
        "this game used to be good but they have ruined the opponents. being a level 9 on all  units costs more to build to attack than the resources you can scavenge from your opponents. also the developers are allowing hundreds of absolutely identical bases to be produced so even if you decline an attack and are repaired you get matched to a different 'player' but with the same base. it's a disgrace.",
        "The new event challenge is great but the number of times the game crashes now is unbelievable. To make it worse it only seems to crash when I'm almost getting a 3 star win so I then end up with a loss and lose any troops which take ages to rebuild. Please fix it."

Just nother point n click, like bleach online mmorpg.  The game that has all sexy babes no dudes, and the chicks beat dudes and practice femdom, we probably get the highest ratings and be the most popular lol.",
        "This is not the game i watched a video for. I would like to play that game (if it exists) but the link brought me this steamer. I'm sure your well aware of this as you've had plenty of reviews saying as much so its obvious to me you dont care. Great way to build a loyal customer base",
        "The game was fun for a little while, but it becomes quite monotonous. The game isn't interactive enough to keep you coming back for more. You more or less just watch your heroes battle which takes a lot of possible fun out of the game right away. If you spend any cash at all on the game, you unlock the ability to \"raid\" your already completed missions. So then when you need items, you will just mash the raid button until your energy is gone. And the energy recharges VERY slowly. You can play for free, but will progress substantially slower than the pay-to-play player. So overall, it's fun for a short while (a week or two), but you will quickly grow tired of it due to poor interactivity. If you are looking for a game similar to this that will keep your interest and has much more to offer, I would recommend Summoners War.",
        "Game apparently 'malfunctioned' and the heroic chest kept saying open free.  This was after I spent $25 US dollars so of course I thought why wouldn't I get some free opens?  I didn't know they were charging me 200 emeralds a pop.  Customer service was NO help.  Hopefully I can get a refund from Google Play.  Don't download!  Bad programming, scam in game purchases!",

Spirit Rest runs rely on speed and now it seems after 10-15 minutes (of inactivity, in an idle game) the game becomes unresponsive until you force close and restart, potentially losing what progress you had made. I know this is an implementation to stop bots but it has only made the game more cumbersome than ever before for living players. Please reverse this Ekkorr! Surely you can find some other way to combat bots without placing such a heavy burden on the rest of us.",

        "I have played this game for years now. Great new levels, still challenging, and fun ways to earn power-ups without having to make a purchase! Loved it until it quit working on my phone. Doesn't even crash anymore, just quits mid-play and I lose whatever progress I'd made. I play when I can on my tablet, but it's just not the same. I don't know why it won't work on my phone without spontaneously closing! 5 stars if it did...",
        "I love, love  this game is difficult to play, but to my opinion is the best game on line ihave been playing for 2 years and my goal is to beat it . you get rewards. I spend money but with the rewards you get something back  ,also I just started another game with is similar like pandapop and iam a also give it 5 stars . even that iam a grandmother of 72 years old. I still popping. !!",
        "A wonderful game to have very fun and exciting install right away you won't regret it. I've reached level 1049. It is super exciting to me learning how to Ricochet the balls off the walls. The projection of the angle need it. This is my all-time favorite and I highly recommend it to my friends and family. Plus, the little bit of flaws and the enemies within the game, will have you taking a break and coming back for more. Just know that I've deleted this game twice but always came back to it because this game , is fun and challenging .  If you don't like a challenge you won't like this game .  Just so you know , it does not require internet, to be able to play this game like others. Technicians please put out more games that don't need the Internet to play. This game is one of them. Just know that option is super helpful. We need more games able to be played without internet intervention. Ty taking time to read this. Have fun a Poppin. LOL",
        "Not bad, not great. Randomly stops in the middle of play and you lose a life. Also takes a long time to load and to move to the next level. Okay for free, but if I paid for it I would be asking four a refund.  Update: I've contacted the developers multiple times. They keep sending the same canned response.  Game crashes frequently. Frustrating when you are just about to finish a level. Uninstalling.",
        "I use to give this a 5 star rating until I lost all of my panda belt progress when I updated, 5 days ago. I sent a report to you and got a message that said there was a problem with the update. I'm still waiting for an answer on when this will be fixed. I refuse to play any levels or specisls, like badboon lair until I can receive the panda belt credits. If I don't receive the panda belt credits or if I am not credited for the points that I lost I will uninstall this game!!!!!",
        "I loved this game and have played it for a few years now. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the last few months, it just closes on me mid play and I lose on my progress, as well as any items and special powers that I used to advance in a level. Very frustrating to lose items and have to start all over on the level."

        "The game has changed over the years to make it easier for any gamer to join at any point and still keep equal grounds with some of the older gamers. Just like any free game their is a \"pay to win\" area in the game, this makes it unfair during the area, in which I thought was great till I descovered it",
        "A long time player here. The app has taken the garbage pay to win route. The event drop rates have been nuked the summon rates are even worse. You literally have no chance at getting any of the LR rarity cards unless you spend hundreds of dollars. It used to be fun and free players actually had a chance to get decent drops in the past. After the inclusion of the tower event everything went downhill.",
        "Ok look I been playing for a year now I gotta say its the same thing over and over and after you put the tower events in it was fun but then you taken the free jewel crystals off for us free players in the tower rewards... Pay to win game.. This game is getting boring",
        "Card art is great, but more importantly surprisingly deep meta plot where characters frequently do throwbacks to past monthly plots. Tho albeit the monthly plot is linear, kinda basic, repetitive x10, and don't get me started on tower events. BUT joining a guild adds a whone other level of fun chatting with other players and the Devs really care about the community! Who offer ALOT of free stuff to free users (especially during the holidays) and aren't afraid to apologize for making a mistake. TLDR: simple game, great devs, and Oracle is best girl",
        "Ever since the October update it has started to crash a lot. Love the game play and graphics but the crashing can be annoying if it happens in the middle of an important battle. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars across the board.",
        "A card battle game with a wide variety of characters and abilities to develop. A perfect game for those with the time and patience to devote to it. And for those in a hurry to win, the gem system lets you buy your way to success and power."

The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",

Started buying DBs to support you...please include free ssr tickets for 50 and above DB purchase! Sr+ tickets for 40 DBs and less.  You'll have more buyers if you do that. Keep it up!",
        "Nice game to play,very addictive. Unfortunately there's so many bugs in the game,such as freeze suddenly (can't click aything in game),sometimes game ended before 45 min (often ends in 29 min) and force close issue (not responding). Please fix this bug ASAP. Much appreciated. Thanks.",
        "i dont know what to say... i feel grateful for your march event log in bonus. New & old player can snatch 1 SSR player but this new event though why you make it more depressing feature ? i figure playing this game is like working to get money.... i thought this game suppose to be fun and bring childhood memories, i know you need effort to get gold ticket but this \"effort\" is all based on luck already see many people day 1 got 0 gold ticket day 2 got 5 gold ticket...... just how? seriously if u want to make new event at least make it friendly for user i dont see point to play this game all night long to get that rewards your just making people to stay aeay from your game not attracting them shame event",
        "the game is just awsome but it has many cracks. the problem now is that matches don't start they keep loading forever this all happens when the photos in the missions menu appear white space. i don't even know the reason behind it ! i would rate the app 5 stars if it got fixed.  everytime this happens i have to reinstall the app",
        "Remind me of childhood anime.. Good game but have some minor bugs as far as I played.. Should be add ability to substitute players in middle of match, not only when half time rest.. Maybe some dribble or combination attack skill should be used to pass multiple players and get our player closer to the keeper. Please add more story match. Also fix regular online match, it's always freeze.",
        "Never watched the anime but played the game on snes and was a fan ever since. Its great to see it alive. Just wish it wasn't so much pay to win."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much",
        "At first I wasn't sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn't weigh down on the phone's processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go."

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "I don't understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed.",
        "Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved."

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Please give us the option to disable Auto Target Tracking in settings.  The auto tracking can cause you to fire at ships your not wanting to target, especially if there lined up side by side. And cause your shots to fall way short or too far if the enemy ship is coming straight towards you. If love to have the ability to disable this feature in the settings."

        "Hi! I have been playing bloons td ever since the 1st one came out and I'm still playing btd5 today. I can't wait for btd6 and btd adventure later this year! Also. One suggestion, I feel like a lot of long time players including myself would be much more likely to participate in the random events on maps if they were also doable on mastery mode. Thank You! I look forward to more big things from Ninja Kiwi!",
        "Works good on my Sony Xperia XZs. Only problem is if I'm doing an impoppable track and I'm using Monkey Engineers. On those few levels where a mass of regeneration bloons come in, the game lags like hell. My workaround for that has been to be lame and just get sun gods",
        "Extemely good game for pretty much any age or level of play. Easy to get into and there's enough depth of game that it will take a lot of playing to get bored. Also works well on any platform - I have it on my ipad and Samsung phone. :)",
        "Bloons TDs have always been a favorite of mine. But I'm only giving 3 stars because of a technical issue that's mind boggling. I'm on a galaxy note 8, and I start to experience game halting slowdown on level 79. I had played this game on my note 4, and could easily double that before the hardware struggled. Please please fix it",
        "I love this game. It works great on my phone.  My only problem is that I had to reinstall it and I don't know how to get everything back. If you could help that would be great. Also to be totally honest, I'm pretty sure I didn't save it to the cloud or my Facebook account.",
        "I love this game only problem is I broke my phone and had to get a new one. Trying to figure out how to get everything back. I have purchased alot of things. $31000 and now only have $100. Logged in with my Facebook account still nothing. Help!!!! Please so I can get back to enjoying this game!"

        "A well made app that's immersive, addictive, and the essence of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. The app is mission based and has a complex but easy to use medal system with rock-paper-scissors type of combat. You can join/make a party, or go solo. Money isn't an issue so long as you pace yourself. It gets better the more you play. There are optional event quests and a story, but don't fret if you can't get the app or just starting out; it's slow going. 735 quests.",
        "Liking the cute art style but my god does this game take forever to download even with a low resolution. Has taken me two attempts and I'm doubtful that it's related to my broadband speed and connection (not sure if it's to do with my phone? But again, doubtful.) Would be great if this could be fixed somehow.",
        "I freaking love this game! However I have a small complaint that is probably fixable. I was wondering for my lg g6 if you could expand the borders so the screen would fit. And if the screen is not able to get any bigger, I'm hoping you people can at least put a cool border around it instead of leaving it as a black bar. I know you people can make cool borders. Thanks for your attention!",
        "Hey guys, huge fan of the kingdom hearts series and also the game in general. Though one thing I wish you could add is the option to link your data to your Google Play account as well as Facebook. Not a lot of us use Facebook so I wish there was more options to get your data back if you ever deleted the app. Otherwise, good game!",
        "I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn't really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.",
        "[Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!"

        "I like the game itself, I just want the microphone button be back because using voice chat is really effective while playing. Another is that, please let the other teammates know that the host of the game is trying to match a game, it seems like while the host of the game is matching other teammates stare blankly at their phones without knowing if the host is making a match or not. So far those are my concerns for this game's update.",
        "This game used to be good but it then sucks. When I go to barbarq arena everything turns black cant see anything, the score list skills and settings disappears always and there are other players that are censored. This game is very laggy and has lots of bugs and errors. I will rate it 5 stars if these are fixed.",
        "It's awesome. Though after the latest update I have weird ping jumps eve though my net is okay... But overall I love it. Im not a mobile gamer type. I rarely play games on my phone, but still this got me hooked",
        "I just updated the app but when I try to enter, an error window pops up with the message \"You are not playing the latest version, please update\". Please help me so I can rate it with 5 stars.",
        "Almost like pay to play.. using the last character that shoots bubble seems to be invincible... almost instantly death once you got hit by the bubble. Become dummy in the bubble... also connection very bad",
        "The kind of game that doesn't consume too much data but requires stable connection. That's the most important thing after all. It allows user to partially immerse into the game   and it's super fun and at certain level it requires a very good teamwork with the rest of team members in order to be on the top. Heads up: Avoid teaming with a selfish stupid player..bring no good so far."

        "Only reason im giving it 3 is because i cannot claim my reward fir my decour keeos telling me i need to exi build mode but there is no other way to claim the reward. Otherwise its such a fun and addictive game. Load time on certain items takes a bit longer also",
        "I love the game! It's been a while since I haven't gotten bored of a game. This reminds me so much of restaurant city a few years back. Everything is well put together to keep you playing. I didn't even notice time passed by so quickly as I played! The only thing i wish was added is that you can send more things than just rubies to friends. I'd like to be able to send items to help our friends. Overall amazing game!!",
        "I easily get bored with daily quests from other games, but I rated this 5 stars coz it has kept me hooked for 3 months straight, unusual thing for someone like me. Love the cute graphics, i get hungry with all the food. I love the other users with cat avatars and i love having them do part times for me. Definitely one to recommend. I get network errors, but its cool. Love how its constantly updated wih new and exciting things though i wish i could buy more rubies with real money, but i cant. Dont have real money. Leveling up is fair. Not too fast, not too slow. Just love it. Keep up the good work!",
        "It is really a good game. I just have an issue with one of the quests for the Peter Pan episode, with Wendy to be more specific. I have already tapped the said character to hear her say \"Is this love? \" more than that was required, and yet it would not let me move forward to the next quest simply because it was not counting accurately. It was really irritating.",
        "I love this game so much that i wanted to have another account. I've tried installing it on my computer using bluestacks but sadly,it doesn't open. There's a note saying use of third party apps trying to modify data is prohibited. Does it mean that the game is not supported in bluestacks? Please enlighten me. Thanks.",
        "I'm on Level 31 and my i have my game saved on my google play. But when i installed it on my new phone, it doesn't sync my saved game data. It was already connected but there's nothing happen. But when i checked my achievements on google play games, all was there. I contacted the developer on GMail but until now there's no update on how will i retain my saved game data!"

        "No point in being able to have a ton of ppl on your friends list if you can't send more then 5 gifts. Should be able to at least send to all. 148 floors before u can rebirth? Too much a pain in the ass when you get stuck on a floor cause you can't beat the boss with current gear but you need to advance to get better gear.",
        "Wow.. I though it an RPG game.. Well ur role is to create an account and that's it... All auto, game play (if any) is rushed..no time to savor the game.. what so ever.. U keep getting full bags.. When u try organizing, it full again in before u finish...and much more.. In my opinion.. It's not a really a game..  well just money sucker maybe.. (Just my opinion).",
        "Picked this game up because it looked kind of like Nonstop Knight, and I liked Nonstop Knight. Unfortunately, it's not LIKE Nonstop Knight, it IS Nonstop Knight. It's a lazy reskin of the same game with more micro transactions bolted on.  Don't waste your time. Nonstop Knight is more fun and it won't do everything in its power to drain your bank account.",
        "Stay away from this game all it does is rollback after you do stuff in game it's so great to get to lvl50 3 days in row to just be knocked back to lvl47 3 plus times a day.  They steal items gained, don't bother to reset attempts, just waste of time.",
        "The gms in this game care nothing for their players. There was a \"rollback\" bug that liked to remember everything you spent, but not any of the rewards or achievements you recieved. After losing over 4k gems, multiple pieces of advanced gear, a very rare talent, countless forge points, and even a rare pet, they decide to give everyone 1000 gems as a \"shut up, take this even though we know you lost so much, but we aren't doing anything else to keep our players\" as a reply pretty much.  The game it's way to buggy and full of support that just doesn't care about their players are all. I would never suggest playing this game to anyone.",
        "As promised here's my edit. The latest update seemed to resolve the issue, at least for me. Although I see in chat others are still having the issue so hopefully this will get resolved for good. Thank you for your speedy service."

        "Awesome Game!  I love everything about it. From \"Zelda\" look to it to the strategies needed to succeed. At first I thought it would be boring cause it doesn't look like the latest technology but that's what's awesome about it. Totally old school baby! Big two thumbs up from me. You have to try it. Don't judge the book by its cover. Easy play, great graphics, affordable if one chooses to pay which is not required. I got an 8 star card without paying a dime. Just participate in the events and you'll be fine. Thx for the fun guys ( and girls 😆)!",
        "I don't understand why this game isn't under the strategy section, for plenty of it is involved for all players! For example, you have to strategize how much money you're going to take out of your paycheck each week to play this game and actually keep up with it. I've been playing this game ever since the highest rarity was 6 stars, but the 11 stars are absolutely amazing! I just can't wait until they announce 12 stars! Or 18 stars! Or 27 stars! I'll definitely be paying $100 - $300 for a single card then!",
        "Fun, sometimes It's a fun game,developed to encourage you to spend money. \"I'm done with this game! After $300 I still didn't get that 10 star!\" Is a common phrase I hear from my allies.. My reply is \"you spend money on this game???\" Anyway, I've been playing for years and I have plenty of 9 star cards and one 10 star. So year it's definitely a pay-to-win kind of thing. But luckily the Events can be fun, and it's a distraction at least.",
        "Been having a problem starting 26/12/2016 where i try to enter the game and it says i need a working internet connection. My internet is fine, uninstalled, reinstalled. Same issue. Please help me out!! Brilliant game, super addictive play it all day every day. You don't NEED to pay to be effective, just patient and smart. But paying could help you I guess if you have the favour of the RNG gods.",
        "This is an update to my original review in 2013. Fantasica is light, fun and intuitive. The mechanics for the tower defense are well set out. Constant events and new cards are always being added to keep things from feeling stale. There are cooldowns, like all free games nowadays, but fantasica doesn't force hours of downtime.",
        "Sent them email asking:  Why is my login count stop at 256? Do you cap it at that number?   Moba reply: \"Regarding your concern, please provide us with the following information so that we can properly assist you:  Account name: Mobage ID: Date the issue occurred: Screenshot of the issue: Device type: Device OS:  We hope to hear from you soon.\"  After I sent them those details.

I will update my review with 5 stars when the game us updated again to the way it was.",

This use to be one of my favorite games but on Android it still is fun but to many bugs and like I said CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS"

        "Fun and easy to pick up and learn quickly. The game has nice effects and a huge variety of characters to play an upgrade. Love the auto play button for when I'm doing something around my apartment. I can still play it but not having to keep my eye on it too much. Music and voices can get sort of annoying but that's what a volume button is for right?",
        "One of the better rpg strategy games out. There's a ton of things available to do if you run out of stamina. The main currency is diamonds which you can purchase but surprisingly they are not that difficult to acquire in game.  Overall I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed games like Fate grand order, syd story and dokkan battle.",
        "Its kinda good, not my favorite but still pretty good. Also, J hate that you took Sayori from Doki Doki Literature Club just so you can have it in your commercial. Talk about copy right.",
        "Game is fun. I like the arts of character, well designed but some new arts like Cynthia looks really weird. End game seems alot of harder, and lately requires alot of luck or money to get stuff like skins etc. Still a great game, been playing for over 1 year.",
        "I used to love this game before a few months ago and was having a blast just playing hours on end until the next daily mission. But ever since the update, servers are terribly slow, game always forces out from time to time. Even despite that internet is at a excellent proximity range, the servers are just terrible for some reason which is sad since as an experienced player who been playing and supporting this for over 1 year, it feels as if it's getting worse and worse with each new update",
        "This game has not fixed the commercial issue. Still illegal. Plus the loading screen is taking forever and it seems they did not like my last review so they deleted it."

Thanks Big Fish❣❣ Still enjoying the game",

For example; I haven't been able to play the new Leprechaun game sine the last update and I'm not signed in through Facebook so if I uninstall the app then reinstall it I'll lose everything. Also I have great 100 Mbps WiFi but still get bumped out room, especially if I'm on a winning streak. Fix my Leprechaun game and give you 5⭐s across the board!!",

        "This game is quite relaxing and can be competitive at the same time. It's a good game for you to chill.  Hi gamegos, could you do something about the accidental purchase? Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",
        "Love this game spent some money on it but still very fun.  They do specials on packages pretty cheap that speed things up.  Has a lot to do in it too doesnt get boring.  Good if you have a long time to play or just a couple minutes.",
        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

        "This is an amazing rogue like. I only have one problem with the game - WHY IS THERE NO CONSOLE/PC VERSION?!? I would pay good money for a PC or console rendition of thus game. As a mobile game it's nothing much, but throw this on steam and it would rival Binding of Isaac. All in all a great, smooth and challenging game! I definitely recommend it!",
        "Hay soul knight! Good game! The 4 player thing is a good update, but the next update is more of a hard 1 to think of is it? it like its has no more to improve :( But I have a idea! Why not have gun skins! Most gun games have gun skins! But its up to you to do it or not. P.S. I have tested a PS4  controller and it WORKS! Did u add it or is it a gust a random thing? Thx",
        "Five stars! I don't give good reviews  unless I like the game, with Google play that's becoming kind of rare so having a breath of fresh air like this is truly amazing. One thing that this game just different from just about every other game on Google Play is that it doesn't Force ads on you! Instead it will offer you an add for currency or an extra life, purely by choice not by shoving it down your throat! The art style is so old-school and I love it, not to mention that the wepons are insane!!! I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this, keep up the good work ChillyRoom! :D",
        "Great game! Very addicting as well...  But Multiplayer-wise: This game needs to be more optimized for slower devices in order to avoid Server Crashes/Lags, and also needs to improve on the Multiplayer Connection difficulty... Then last but not least, could you make a SEPARATE Save File for Multiplayer Games? Seriously, it bugs me when my friends and I save a game to continue the next day without being able to play at all unless if I want the Save File to be lost.",
        "I saw this game earlier back in 2017, but was reluctant to try it. Though I'm very glad I decided to try it out today, because the first several minutes were pretty awesome. The music on the title especially got me hyped to play. I'll probably be keeping this one for a while.",
        "Would've put 4 stars but I have problems playing multiplayer. Whenever a multiplayer game starts,  our phones would suddenly go back to the home screen for some reason. Pls help or at least explain"

The customerservice page also seems to be a Facebook page, where upon successful contact of the customer service they will ask you for your device model your gamer ID they will ask you way too much information that they do not need as this is all computer based and should be quite self evident as to what server and person is contacting them. I had no choice but to contact Google regarding this as it doesn't seem like a normal practice given the amount of games that I have played from the Google Play Store of this type.",

        "I absolutely LOVE this game!! The stories of each character are amazing! I just wish they had more suitors. And I wish they made more games exactly like this but with a completely new story line and characters. Like, I love the voice animations and how long the chapters are and how long the story line of each person is. I also love how your character talks like a modern day girl when she's at the sengoku era. You don't have to pay to see more about each person either. It's amazing. I Love this app. Please make more!!!! ❤️❤️❤️",
        "So, this is my third update. That's how much I love this game 😂. Thank you for giving us castle and closet space via game events. Very helpful. I don't have anymore lag issues. And I appreciate the diversity in storylines. No route is the same, unlike other Otome games. Also, the relationship development is fantastic - not too slow or fast. The main character actually talks like a real person and less like a \"character\". Art is beautiful, too. I just feel bad that I can't say much about the music or voice acting, as I usually have my phone on vibrate.",
        "Idk what to say, but one thing for sure I really loveee this game!!!! Is so awesome, the chara omg so magnificent. I don't mind spending much money on this game hahaha it's so freaking beautiful!!! And I really love the MC she's so strong and cute, it's just like I want to have a route for MC too. But rn I'm waiting for KENSHIN UESUGI route, I hope it will come out soon. Damn, Cybird always make such a beautiful otome game. Thank you for making this game, it just made my life💗💗💗💗",
        "I couldn't resist to do a newer version of the review, so here it is. I've been playing this game for nearly three months now, and that's saying something. First of all, the story is really engaging. The characters are really sweet, and I love how we don't need to spend money to enjoy it, unlike other otome games. Shout-out to the people who made Ieyasu's route a dream come true.",
        "There are only a few routes out currently but they are wonderful all the same. The main character is funny and reacts realistically to situations! Not to mention the voice acting is impeccable like wow I don't speak a word of Japanese but everytime Nobunaga speaks I'm just nodding along. Also this game has an adorable animated series and it is the best",
        "The most romantic and sweetest experience of falling in love game..  I feel like I'm truly falling in love with Masamune date.. Love his playful side, his sweetness,  fierce yet gentle  sometimes.. The only reason I CANNOT RATE 5 STAR is I cant read back the route chosen even though I have spent actual money..  Its like I'm purchasing the story,  but the fact is,  I'm not.. This is frustrating..  Atleast after having spending so much money,  we can keep the story to be read again afterwards..  Please reconsider this..  Thank you"

        "This game is not stable on android phones at all. I find i cannot play it \"due to network instability\" on my phone when I can on my iPad, using the same wifi network.  It crashes and sometimes lags.  Very frustrating. #firstworldproblems",
        "I can't play it if im using data. But if im on wifi, its all good. This only happens to me after i change my phone from Huawei Mate 9 to Mate 10. Pls get it fix!",
        "This is a fun game to play, when it loads. It shows the video of the Tsum Tsums then it freezes on a black screen. Very annoying that it takes 5 or 6 attempts to start it before you can play.",
        "I like this game a lot, but it has some one big frustration. In a game that involves the collection of various characters, it can be disheartening to spend money on this game and still not get the tsum tsum you want,  even during the so-called \"lucky times\". I recommend keeping your money in your wallet since it is unlikely that you collect the ones that you want, when you want them.   There is also a minor glitch in loading the game, but if you try multiple times, it will eventually load.",

        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Like ot a lot. Taskforces need to be improved drasticly. Focus on playing with others makes it a lot more fun. EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "Addictive and engrossing game.  The bonus covers work well. The constant character tweaking and release rate makes the vs progression awards with wins is very good.  The favorites is a good way to let folks focus on building certain characters.  The transition points are still frustrating, especially when you get a run of bad luck with tokens.  Tokens might work better if they scaled instead. Biggest issue is progression awards in versus and the tough transitions in levels.",
        "I have been playing this game for a few years now and love it! But a little suggestion... Because of the time I've spent playing it and the already difficult ability to get 4 and 5 star characters, I have nearly 3 million iso-8 that I literally cannot spend. Please add a way to convert iso-8 into hero points or command points!!! I'd like to get further in the game instead of literally stockpiling iso-8. This has all been done without spending a single dollar on the game too, btw",
        "This is an awesome, addictive and hyper fun game. Brilliant idea and concept. In all the games I have played this is the first I have spent money on. VIP member. Have a couple suggestions for developer tho. Can you add abilities to swap covers with alliance members and maybe add as a bonus drop for playing, an extra free slot. Keep up the brilliant work. Truely love this game.",
        "This is my go-to game. Day and night. It's fun, simple and sometime challenging. My only complaint is that i have like a million of Iso-8 and don't know what to do with them. My thought would be that if we don't need so much Iso-8, be sweet to give some to aliance member who needs it or so on. Great game. Don't know what I'd do without it!",
        "Suitable for all age groups, Marvel Puzzle Quest is a great game for everyone. Progress with higher tier characters may be slow but yet significant. The wide variety of heroes and villians within the game allows for endless possibilities of the \"best team\". Highly addictive, I would recommend this perfect game to anyone and everyone.",
        "Love that they are always adding new characters. Would like to see some different characters like Cable, Domino, Sabretooth, and Bishop just to name a few. Just because they don't have a movie... Would also like to see some new events, new animations, and less repetitiveness. Love the collection part and finally being able to use characters when you've finally built their powers enough. Love that it can be played for free. Love that feedback is read and the game is constantly evolving.Thanks."

        "A good graphics for a good beginning franchise. A well tame game for an anime base. But my concerns on playing this game is sometimes ita forcing crash. (I thought this was a high end game so basically you need a good phone that can handle a game like this) im looking forward for better improvements such as more charcaters to come. And much more sfx. Big thumbs up for this game.",
        "Great game and graphics. Need to work on the optimization though as constant crashes occurs. Will also be thrilled to see rework on Yomo as he looks really plain in this game. Character collision and ability lock in also needs improvement, especially those with dashes which will be better to have single target lock in. Overall as a TG fan I love this game.",
        "The game is absolutely amazing ^^ This is definitely one of the better start up games in the app store. I would love to see more improvement with the graphics, load time, and effects. I can't wait to see the characters that will be added next. If I may I'd like to suggest that everyone's eyeball fascinated mask maker be added. Uta is definitely one of my favorite characters and it's a shame Yomo was implemented but not Uta. Many wishes for this game ^^",
        "I have been waiting for someone to make a Tokyo ghoul game now here it is. What can I say about this game other then its awesome I love it , but I do wish they would add more characters and maybe add some from the Tokyo ghoul re manga but anyways awesome game. Now someone needs to make a my hero academia game then a one piece game and I'll be happy.",
        "Had been really enjoying this game despite the consistent crashes.  Now; however, the game won't even start.  It stays stuck on the beginning loading screen.  Please fix and I will update my review.  EDIT:  issue fixed.  Looks like it was maintenance they didn't bother announcing until after the fact.  Love the game so still 5 stars but would be nice to have to some advance notice with these things.",
        "Ok, as fun as this game is, it has a lot of problems. Severe lagging during missions and crashing, just to name the few. On top of that, lately I can't even start up the game, cuz I get stack on the loading screen before I can even log in into the server. Very disappointed. There's hoping the devs will fix that issue soon, since this game shows a lot of potential."

Need to loosen slots. Been playing over 800 consecutive days and over level 1220. Side challenges and jackpots dont pay either. Best of all the slots I've played tbough. Would give 5 Stars if payouts were better and emails would work.",

I waited to review this game until I was able to redeem some rewards so I could know if it really works, and I'm happy to report that it does.

I buy average 40 to 60 dollars a week in points plus the free points and the games games just don't have a good payout rate. That's probably the worst thing. And not alot of free spin hits. They use to now like everywhere else you can go they are tight and just take take take.",

I have managed to successfully transfer all my old data to this new app before, but I would like to transfer my new & existing data to another device. I have registered & followed all of the instructions to the tee on the transfer form & it always says \"could not transfer data\" . Also there is no fill space on the form that prompts to fill in  'Support ID'. I hope this gets looked into.",
        "I find this app very convenient and like it a lot. But there are a few small bugs(eg. BMP's scene transition fx) and if possible, I hope the data on device can be stored in the SD card as it's taking up quite a lot of space. Thank you very much for the hard work and improving the app all the time, Voltage. ^^",
        "I have no problem anything except the roulette. I hope Voltage will change the value of coins from 5 to 10(bronze), 10 to 50 (silver) and 100 (gold) remains the same.  It requires unfathomable patience for how many days just to get the whole story. One chapter for 100 coins, I'm fine with it if it has only 5 chapters but aside from too many chapters it has also separated sequels and epilogues. *cries*  Please reconsider changing the amount of coins. Hopes for better system and greater stories.",
        "Loved it,even though at the beginning,i 'm a bit skeptical about it, it is kinda efficient in some way.but i do miss the standlone apps.also the login bonus is quite dissapointing,like we only get 5-10? At least give us a bit of generous amount like 10-20 coins",
        "For anyone looking for an MC who isn't a pushover, try the newer stories. Our Private Homeroom stands out as unusually well-localized, to the point it feels like someone studied the English speaking hemisphere of the Internet for modern slang. I very much appreciate the upgrade in sass and backbone, so it was pretty well done nonetheless. I've been a monthly subscriber for months with no intention to change this.",
        "Prices aren't competitive with paperback books. Why spend $4 per chapter when I can buy a 400 paged book new for $8. Also, the daily login bonus gives 5-10 coins per day; it would take months to unlock a single chapter at that rate. The only thing thia app has going for it is the free story every 2 weeks. 🙏🙏🙏 I suggest making this work more like Voltage's Lovestruck app & also letting us watch adds in exchange for coins."

I mean, his skills are good but poor in execution. His skills took too long to trigger. He would take too much damage before he trigger his skills.",
        "I really like this game I've been grinding it everyday since the 2nd day it was out. The only thing that is really annoying is the fact that the 3rd and 4th skills are going to take years to max out. Like one lvl 4 monster for 1 little space? That's like 300 evolve spores for 1 space and over 1000 for 1 letter upgrade. That's like a joke in my opinion",
        "Terrible customer service. Great game and I wanted to keep playing, but I lost my account due to a phone issue and it's been several days with no response even as a paying customer.",
        "Actually i like it. The art-style, the gameplay. It was just that it is very annoying when you cant update or even play via Wi-Fi. It \"is\" a huge problem. Not all people have their internet on a reasonable price. And they do tend to update their app on Wi-Fi hotspot. It is a trouble and a bug. You gotta fix it. Other than it. It is a pretty good game. Cheerio",
        "Compared to similar games, this is a lot more fair. You aren't at the mercy of RNG, with enough time you will own every monster in the game. The roster is pretty small, but balanced. It definitely deserves a try, though the racy tone and humor might rub some people the wrong way.",

    "description" : "Large war strategy game \"Glory Road\" 2018 new version, Valentine's Day party! Strive to create a more perfect gaming experience.SettingDuring the several decades of King Edmund's reign, the Kingdom of Glory had been peaceful. However, the king's younger brother had been coveting the throne,  and he has even decided to launch a war to usurp the throne because King Edmund's son would soon inherit the throne. In order to win the war, he signed a contract with the Night Demon - the lord of demons. He sold his soul to the Night Demon and he thus gained a large number of Wights in return to dispatch.In the end, King Edmund died during the war and he handed over the throne to the prince before he died. Since then, the new king has been taking up the heavy responsibility to fight against his uncle and also the Wights, rebuilding his homeland and reviving the kingdom...FeaturesIn contrast with traditional simulation games, this game has more elements of strategy and development. In the game, you can build your own territories, rally troops, develop arms, cultivate dragons, and fight together with various heroes and even gods. Like traditional simulation games, it has a siege system, too. In addition, it has numerous elements of war, including adventure, military exercises, Dragon Treasure, battle for capitals, battle for the throne, and so on.

However, the king&apos;s younger brother had been coveting the throne,  and he has even decided to launch a war to usurp the throne because King Edmund&apos;s son would soon inherit the throne. In order to win the war, he signed a contract with the Night Demon - the lord of demons. He sold his soul to the Night Demon and he thus gained a large number of Wights in return to dispatch.<br>In the end, King Edmund died during the war and he handed over the throne to the prince before he died.

        "I'm not a fan of mobile gaming, but this game is truly something else. I love The Walking Dead, so I gave this a shot, however, after playing Road to Survival (or whatever it's called- it's the TWD game based off of the comics), my expectations were pretty low. This game though, is not Road to Survival; it's so much more. This is how you do a free to play game with microtransactions right. You can buy a lot in this game with money, but you can easily obtain everything on your own, and quite frankly, it's more fun to do that anyways. This game is super addicting and gives me something fun to do when I've got a few minutes. I've been playing it for months, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.",
        "Just a suggestion, it'll be SO MUCH MORE AWESOME probably 10 stars for TWD fans if you could do better missions or events that allow us to get better opportunities to farm for TWD character tokens or class tokens, and also more chance for farming or creating weapons instead of the current set up now. Don't quite like the fact that when deals are awesome but they cost a ton! Try lessen the value a little bit and im sure some players dont mind spending (just my opinion). But overall review, its awesome for TWD fans out there!",
        "It's got good action in graphic. Been playing for a 2 years in 10 month's now.Stay human and Survive.  Up dates all the time love it keep them coming Robert Cregman. Thanks for making the Walking  dead show And game. New stuff to do all the time. In wow all these new survivers. There are some loading issues action issues movement issues alot more mission.",
        "Originally gave you 4 stars, but its one of only a couple of mobile games I have never deleted since installing. Constant content coming in, great use of TWD licence! Keep up the great work- seriously from someone who hates most mobile games!",
        "I've been playing for over 2 years. A few more new maps would be nice and stop nerfing our great traits like interrupt and wrestler! Other than that, great game and great community.",
        "Really good strategy game. The thing that lost it the 5th star is that when I started a second game on another device, it won't play ads for free stuff"

So there would be more players. Also if avatar emojis features were there, it would be fun to intract with players, like sitting, crying, sleeping, like those in age of wushu.. Other than that This is an awesome game.. Better than age of wushu for me.. And also very addicting..love it.. Hoping for an update..",
        "Great graphic but u need to work on the gameplay more as well. The gameplay doesnt seem very...natural,and u gotta have an option where u can disable \"auto\" for players who dont wanna use that feature.",

        "I love the game as well as Age of Wushu and Sword of Romance, now the only problem i have is that my cellphone gets super hot, I can not touch the screen and have to let the game rest until i can play again. If you can fix this issue that would be great. But thanks for having English version of games like this.",
        "it's fun, but i think they need to improve PvP arena from auto mode only to free control mode, and hope they will make more new bosses. this game is fun and don't need too much RAM and ROM hope this game will have more active player"

The game is interesting as long as your queries are listened but the developers has assigned some candidates who will give you same rply all the time. Developers need to think over it, they are making game more worst. For freedom has to travel a long way to reach Clash of kings Benchmark. I played COK for 2 yrs and there's no game like COK.

Sometime more worst u will get no win in the free spin.. Those daily quest more funny show that have reward.. But if u do the quest ur balance is even that consider lucky.. Not a reward at all better don't do.. Once the quest needs that will stuck or make u lose more to success.. Those customer service is not helpful.. Always reply the same thing is like auto reply system. Betting make higher never notice but daily spin reward never adjust high.. Customer service always reply oh u have hit big win, have free spin, though US is stupid. Sometime game problem what is quest succeed but no reward get but always is player problem.. They won't try find out what game problem only advise player to restart, Line not good.. Like all is player problem. This game make player angry..

Trong đó nổi bật nhất lần update này là tính năng liên đấu 3vs3, cho các Dũng Sĩ tổ đội với nhau để tranh tài liên server cùng nhiều thời trang, tọa kỵ mới.I – Giới thiệu:- Đây là tựa game mobile MMORPG duy nhất không chia phe hay thế lực, mà tập trung vào hệ thống Quân Đoàn để gắn kết cộng đồng.- Kiểm chứng bởi cộng đồng game Hàn, đây là tựa game có hệ thống tương tác giữa người chơi sâu sắc, mật thiết. Có anh em là có tất cả!- Đồ họa chuẩn Châu Âu, hình ảnh sắc nét, hiệu ứng và kỹ năng hoành tráng.- Game có hệ thống Lãnh địa tranh đoạt mang lợi ích vô song và thực tế nhất.- Chiến trường không giới hạn, Quân Đoàn chiến vinh danh Hoàng Thành Chủ.- Hệ thống Boss đa dạng: Boss dã ngoại, Boss thế giới, Boss Quân Đoàn…- Game có hệ thống Pet và thú cưỡi phong phú nhất trên mobile- Đám cưới sang trọng mang phong cách quý tộc, diễu hành quanh thành.- Tối ưu hóa trên các thiết bị có cấu hình thấp, tự động điều chỉnh chế độ tiết kiệm pin khi không có thao tác.Ngoài ra, Chiến Binh Huyền Thoại - Kỵ Sĩ Rồng 2.0 còn rất nhiều các tính năng đặc sắc khác cho các bạn thỏa sức khám phá!II- Lưu ý từ BQT:1. Game đã thiết kế dân cày cũng có vị thế độc tôn, còn VIP thì sẽ nổi bật oai hùng. Vì thế, anh em chả còn lo bị GATO, tứ hải giai huynh đệ.2. Tựa game này TUYỆT ĐỐI không dành cho người “yếu tim”, sống ích kỷ chỉ có hại không có lợi.3. Có thêm ANH EM, càng đông càng vui4. Trong game có vô số Quân Đoàn, gặp là “bem”, ngứa mắt là PK5. Khỏe chưa chắc đã “cân team” nhưng ĐÔNG lại là một lợi thế6. Treo máy cày quái là bình thường, nhưng hãy CẨN THẬN những tên “farm người”, tranh bãi train.7. PK đồ sát người khác bị chữ đỏ? Lính canh không BỎ QUA cho bạn đâu. Vào tù còn có thể bị mấy thằng bạn khốn thả chó cắn. Nghĩ mà cảm thấy, tym tao đau quá man !

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Update: Now it won't even open. Once you find out your progression is rigged, the fun wears off. You will have a win streak going, them \"mysteriously\" a machine will show up with just the right set up to beat yours. Then once you finally get the right configuration to beat that one (however long that takes) another machine with the perfect set up to beat yours shows up again preventing you from progressing. Over and over and over....",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete."

        "Stupid developer allow topup refund but at the same time banned the players unless pay back the refund. So why allow refund in the first place? So the loophole of the system made them revenge on players. Stupid game management.",

    "description" : "HỢP KÍCH 36 THẾ - XƯNG ĐẾ THIÊN HẠ“Một trong những sản phẩm game thẻ tướng chiến thuật chất lượng nhất đến từ Studio của Netease – một trong những công ty game lớn nhất thế giới, Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng xứng đáng là trò chơi công phá năm 2018 được game thủ kì vọng nhất.” – Sendor Grimer – BTV Gamek.vn1. PHÁT HÀNH TOÀN CẦU VỚI NHIỀU NGÔN NGỮ TẠI NHIỀU QUỐC GIAPhát triển từ một Studio thuộc Tencent, Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng đã được phát hành tại 6 quốc gia thị trường lớn trên thế giới bao gồm: Malaysia, Indonesia, Thái Lan, Hồng Kông, Đài Loan, Macao và bản tiếng Anh toàn cầu. Việt Nam chính là thị trường tiếp theo phát hành trò chơi chiến thuật đang cực kì thành công này.2. ĐẶC THÙ VÀ DUY NHẤT: BỘ TƯỚNG HỢP KÍCH – XUẤT CHIÊU BÍ TRUYỀNTrong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng, mỗi bộ tướng đều có duyên phận, không chỉ kích hoạt các chỉ số đặc biệt khi cùng có mặt trong trận hình, mà còn giúp nhân vật mạnh nhất trong bộ tướng đó thay đổi kĩ năng hoàn toàn mới để xuất tuyệt chiêu hợp kích Bí Truyền. Đây là tính năng chưa một game chiến thuật nào có trên thị trường Việt Nam hiện tại.3. THỜI TRANG QUYẾT ĐỊNH CHIẾN THUẬT – ĐỔI THỜI TRANG, ĐỔI KĨ NĂNGHệ thống thời trang của Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng không chỉ đẹp, “khủng” mà còn đem đến những chỉ số, hiệu ứng thuộc tính và bộ kỹ năng mới đặc thù trên từng bộ thời trang. Vì vậy, khi thay đổi thời trang, nghĩa là người chơi sẽ thay đổi hoàn toàn đặc tính và chiến thuật của trận hình. Đặc biệt, các bộ thời trang này không được cộng dồn thuộc tính, khiến cho trò chơi trở nên trí tuệ hơn nhiều.5. GIẢI ĐẤU ĐỈNH PHONG – VINH DANH TẠC TƯỢNG LIÊN SERVERĐây là tính năng PvP thi đấu liên server trong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng, nơi hội tụ tất cả những game thủ mạnh nhất tại các server, tham gia tranh tài để tìm ra người chiến thắng. Giải đấu được tổ chức như một vòng chung kết WorldCup, thi đấu chia bảng và các vòng đấu cực kỳ hấp dẫn. Ngoài danh hiệu, được tạc tượng liên server, người chơi tham gia giải đấu sẽ nhận thưởng điểm tích lũy dùng để đổi lấy các mảnh tướng Đỏ siêu hiếm. Người chơi khác cũng có thể ủng hộ, bình chọn và cổ vũ những người chơi tham gia giải đấu để nhận thưởng nhiều phần quà giá trị.6. 37 HIỆU ỨNG – TÙY HỨNG TRẬN HÌNH – SO TRÌNH CHIẾN THUẬTChiến thuật trong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng được thay đổi liên tục thông qua các hiệu ứng kĩ năng của tướng như tăng tốc, hóa đá, đóng băng, thiêu đốt, x2 sát thương… Các hiệu ứng này sẽ ảnh hưởng mạnh mẽ đến cách chơi và cách bố trận của game thủ sao cho hiệu quả nhất, từ đó phân định đẳng cấp trí tuệ của người chơi.7. HỆ THỐNG PET ĐA DẠNG, BUFF HIỆU ỨNG TĂNG CHỈ SỐ CHO TƯỚNGTiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng là một trong số hiếm các game chiến thuật có sử dụng hệ thống Pet khi xuất trận. Các Pet này khi xuất chiến sẽ cộng chỉ số khá lớn cho tướng trong đội hình bao gồm cả hiệu ứng. Mỗi Pet sẽ có các chỉ số riêng tùy thuộc vào chiến thuật của người chơi mà tùy biến sử dụng loại Pet hợp lý khi xuất trận. Pet cũng là một trong những thứ có thể show hàng thể hiện sự độc đáo, oai phong cho nhân vật.8. BẠN SẼ KHÔNG CÔ ĐƠN KHI CHƠI GAMEMặc dù là game thẻ tướng chiến thuật Tam Quốc, thế nhưng Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng không hề “tự kỉ” khi có rất nhiều tính năng cộng đồng cho phép tương tác giữa người  chơi với nhau. Với hệ thống bang hội đặc sắc, bang chiến khốc liệt, tổ đội tinh anh, vận tiêu bang hội, công thành chiến, phụ bản liên server, voice chat liên server… thì bạn sẽ không thể cảm thấy cô đơn khi tham gia vào game.

        "Ive been playing this for a year and a half and i can say this game is NOT a pay to win. Pull rates are pretty much the same as in any other game, and units are tradable 90% of the time so its possible to get units you want even if youre not lucky enough to get them from packs. Platinum units are super helpful and are now much easier to get thanks to golden medals which are pretty easy to get in events. Theres different events, some are for unions, some you play for yourself. Also, a game with most friendly users ive met in games, willing to give a lot of help and advice to new players. All in all, ive played for a long time and i dont see myself stopping any time soon unless theres drastic changes",
        "I love this game. Though they don't explain how to obtain platinum medals or how unions work very well. And I would like it if we could exchange 7s units better. I could list 10 units I'd rather have then idun. I would love to exchange her for a Gilles de rais or a fenrir. But no I have to keep this unit I don't want. Because my idun can't even be sold on the bazaar. Though those are my only problems. I'm addicted to this game.",
        "It's really a good game. I've been playing this for a long time. The reason I didn't give 5 star is because there is a player who start arguing with the other player for no reason and i hope i can report this to the game developer but my friend say it would never work.",
        "I've been encountering some problems with the game in terms of going through a quest. It just suddenly bonked me out of the game everytime i get to the boss. I've tried clearing the cache  and reinstalling it but  to  no avail.  I'm using an oppof1s  and whether I connect through  Wi-Fi or other means. It does the same thing. Would like some help with this",
        "I have two copies of this 7* card that is essential to my deck at the moment. Unfortunately they screech this annoying Yossshh yaattaadaraa!!!!!! EVERY freaking time they launch a special. Then freaking golden apples fill up the screen. Unfortunately they are two of my strongest cards. Thinking of dropping this game.",
        "Been playing for a long time seeing the game develop but as of recently when they switched to parade. Pay to play has been so heavily support worse than other games from the platinum club or vip to basically making it impossible to win or even compete without spending money in events especially when they make event units untradable this has not happened for 2 years the game has been out and now they r just plain greedy this game is committing game suicide and it was such a great game before but now they always have their hands out for money its really disappointing."

        "I've tried many TD so far still playing this one..every level in every map is unique..  its cool how I can pick and lvl Heroes but then it takes awhile to add a new one when running out of gems (since gems are needed for Heroes) unless u pay to keep playing or just to wait for tournaments... it takes patience lol but I don't mind playing again",
        "A great game with unique map designs and user friendly controls, free to play if you have patience and play strategically, pay to win if you want to advance faster. It is especially a good game for busy people like me who can only spend 10-15 minutes per day but need to stay in the game for a large number of days to be competitive. Don't try to use items and gems on every maps, it is fun and challenging to clear them without shortcuts. *Tip for developers*: Instead of giving purchase options for Sethos and Phoenix they could go with Yan and Narlax, gives chance for new players to compete also developers can milk in additional purchases.",
        "Great TD game with decent difficulty and NPCs progression while still maintining a pattern making you work to figure out various strategies.  Ads have never been an issue I honestly cant remember where they are.  I think they may only be for like \"double your rewards for battle\" kind of thing.  90% (A) or better in my oppinion.  Mainly cause I want to see more progression.  Note I am only a few levels in so I dont know if theres a pay to get by an immpassable place yet.",
        "*Updated* SCAM! Games slowly bleeds away your gems without mechanics being apparent. (I lost 300 gems in the last 3 days) Good luck unlocking heroes or content without paying $30-40. -2 stars.",
        "Your game is WAY too hard. I am at level 90+ and found the first 3 worlds great fun and balanced but now you have effectively destroyed the enjoyment factor by making the enemies SO strong that you cannot possibly beat them unless you have max level heroes...and the best max level heroes require so much to level up that without paying an absurd amount of real money you may aswell give up.you have broken what could have been the best game on android with selfish Pay 2 win tactics . Uninstalling after months of enjoyment and gameplay.  You need to fix this and make it challenging but not impossible",
        "It's really addicting, a lot of challenges and puzzles for the towers... really loved it! Good job team!   A bit of improvement: maybe an easier way to access the other worlds would be really good!?"

I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",

I love this game please fix so I can continue playing and rate 5 stars.",
        "I'm only putting it as one star in hopes the devs see this, but please find a better way to recover accounts. I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out."

        "Used to be one of the best time management games available but they no longer fix the glitches.  There hasn't been any updates or new venues for a long time so think the game is being phased out. The game is free but you do need to buy gold with hard cash to progress. No longer worth downloading, my advice is to find something else to play.",
        "It is an awesome game. It is very addictive and I feel very invested in it. If you don't want to spend any of your real money to buy gold, you sure don't need to. It takes a hell lot more to get everything you want but it's still playable. It has some bugs, sure, specially regarding your wireless connecting but it's nothing major. The levels are really hard sometimes but makes up for the good challenge. Thanks, devs, for the awesome game",
        "I love this game. I play it almost everyday. The only thing I don't like is when you spend your supplies to play even when you win you still lose those supplies to play instead of keeping your supplies so you can continue to play on. Other then that. It's amazing. So download this app and have some fun today, tomorrow, or whenever you have some past time. Thanks Chef Ramsay.",
        "I love the game. But there's some bug issues like   1) login to claim 10golds - didn't happen. Where'd the gold? 2) now I can't even login to social. It keep loading, then kinda leave it at that.   I would rate it 5 stars once this is resolved. It's really getting on my nerves.",
        "Game could be cool but has way too much stuff crammed into the tiny screen of most phones. Graphics need to be simplified so that you can see things easier. Overall, the game freezes and crashes every time I try to play. Spend more time making this game stable and easy to see and it might be more fun.",
        "Up until five days ago I wasn't having any problems with this game and I played it nearly everyday. Now I can open the app but nothing happens when I click on any part of the game. This has kept me from being able to do anything with the game for nearly a week. I've missed out on events and opportunities to move up on leaderboards. Please fix the app. I enjoy the game and I don't want to lose progress because of a technical error."

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "Great game!!! Still some bug's. You have to log out and log back in to collect the 5 hour daily rewards. Sometimes you can't post in the chat rooms. It will say invalid character. A lot of lag at times when you use the power and impact gauge. There needs to be more options to customize character's and or add more. I also believe the daily 5 hour rewards need to change instead of the same rewards everyday. It is a fun game, and highly addictive. Great graphics, which still could be improved on, looking at newer golf games coming out.",
        "Great game.  Only problem is the huge 10 second warning that covers your shot.   Also the game meter jumps.  So I get penalties for taking longer than 10 seconds when I let the control bar reset.",
        "Almost great. The UI is a crowded mess. Too much nonsense. The equipment tabs are broken due to bugs(I downloaded on several devices) making it impossible to accurately navigate between items, and the putting is rigged(obvious padding) resulting in missed shots that shouldn't happen. Besides these glaring flaws there is great potential here.",
        "A great game easy to play and progress.  Only issue is i can't work out how to change my country from the usa to aus. Sick to death of my putts begging taken off me because you have ridiculously stupid gamer play.  If I putt a ball in real life and it hits the edge of a cup it goes in 90 pc of the time.  If I putt one to the lip of the cup in real life it goes ohm.  But bout your retarded physics.  They stop the ball on the edge or knock it away from the hole. What a load of bulls$/^. Fix this and I may consider upping the rating",
        "I really like this game other than the BIRDS IN THE BACKGROUND!!! Shut them up PLEASE!!! It's very annoying and makes me not want to play this game I have to play it with the volume turned down so I don't have to hear the freaking BIRDS!",
        "Fine before the update. Now it glitches and freezes. Cannot finish a round. Power bar no longer smooth. Not enjoyable to play. I wanted to quit in the middle of the round. Very disappointed in latest update. I hope this is fixed soon. This was my favorite game on mobile device ever and I want to go babe to playing it!"

And you have to buy trending games or else you will lose subscribers you will also lose them if you don't make a video for a amount of time. You have to buy this game it is an impeccable game anyone can play the game and enjoy it",

I played this game for hours upon hours and while it saved all my achievements to my Play account, it clearly doesn't backup there because when I had an issue where I had to reset my phone, I lost my entire progress in the game. This is 2018 kids. This is unacceptable.",

        "Awesome! I can play this game to make levels, play levels, friend people, And customize the avatar! Also, you can play the main levels! This game is really fun to play! And the last thing I was gonna say: You get user coins in levels, Secret coins in main levels and stars in main levels and other levels!Also you get orbs and diamonds on new best. And if you complete main levels! This game is so good. You get colors too! Everyone should play this and never delete it. This is one of my favorite games I was ever playing in my whole entire life! I will play this everyday since this game is so amasing and cool. I will play it already like now. And I like 2.1! And I liked 2.0. But when will will 2.2 be here? In 1 year! So let's keep playing until robtop makes 2.2. But I don't need to wait for 2.2! Cause I don't know what will happen in 2.2 but let's see!",
        "I swear this is one of the best games you could ever play it involves timing but the soundtracks are amazing almost infinite user created levels and 22 regular levels to play. Subzero and Meltdown plus geometry dash world all offer free content that is including light but this is 100% worth the price that it is listed for. Even though I'm not like a certified critic I would still recommend this to anyone 5 and up to whatever age",
        "It is awesome, and you should get it.  Geometry Dash Lite, I mean.  The idea itself is not originally theirs, but they dominated it when they used it.  The music is also amazing, and the fact that you can try making your own level is just even better.  Also, if you did not know, it has levels that are not in the free version.  So there you go, my review",
        "This game is awesome!!!!!!! You can make levels, icons, and other cool stuff!! If you were reading this rate description I hope download this game. :) Now im a bit concerned that now every time i get on a online level it freezes. Please fix this and ill give you back 5 stars. Really now when i click on begginer pack on map packs they're hard",
        "RobTop please reply but if you have an account but you can't log in to it and nobody stole it then how are you supposed to get in your account? And the game is the best ever also check out my level it's called china666. IDK why I named it that, the icons are cute just to say. I think everyone in the USA should play this!",
        "2.11... a great update for icons and change. But. I am now missing 19 of each shard and only 18 ice shards for whatever reason. I wish that didnt need to happen but oh well. Also if a level doesn't exist any more you can't delete your comments off of it. Other that that I love this amazing game. #Rubrub"

I see others are having the same problem and all you say is please email us.  Fix your game or I'm moving on here and at the casino.",
        "Its an okay game, the problem is seems like everyday you end up getting around 200000 coins, and you play for about 6 minutes before you need to find another game to waste some time. The min bet is around 8100 and if you want to play a new or \"the machine of the day\" min bet is around 25k. I suppose its realistic considering you rarely win.",

I can't go 2 the Casino often bc I stopped goin 2 the SCAMMING INDIAN CASINOs so it takes 3 hrs 2 drive 2 a REAL honest GAMING COMMISION REGULATED Casino, so this Pacified me until then. But this 2 is a rip off game, the 2hr Bonus Game. If u watch most of the time the timer isn't even moving so 2hrs is more like 4 hrs! Just another company 2 RIP U off, STOP Falling for this! STOP allowing them 2 win!"

        "If you like flying WW2 era fighters then you'll love this game. Even for being a mobile game I am impressed with everything the game offers. The only thing I do not like is Android users,like myself, cannot fly the plane from the cockpit, hopefully that option will be available soon!",
        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "Just a heads up. Like I said before you people had this planned. Within this year you have proven your desire. Tell me... when have you played a game that changes like a leaf in the wind? I have never seen any Developer change core functions like you have. Wonder why others used to love this game? It's not the graphics! Summoner Wars and Clash of Clans have you beat! Wonder why? They add and not change everything in just a few days like you have. Like I said before...You reap what you have done.",
        "Actually... I was bored and installed this game and I noticed that my gameplay didn't diminished even after the stall was removed. Actually, now that I think about it, I didn't even use the stall that much. I take it back. I am so sorry for the negativity that I showed. I love this game so much. Btw I didn't spend real money on this game lol.",
        "I love this game so much, but there's always a moment when I enter a room that the fade-in heavily lags. I always thought it was just making the area entry take longer, but it's actually gotten me killed upon entering one of the pvp areas, so it's definitely not normal. Nothing I've changed in the system settings has worked, so I really hope I'm not the only one this is happening to. Also, I think the water elemental magic for the Summoner is bugged: I used it several times in the base and main tower, and it hit in wildly different spots depending on whether I was aiming for an enemy or not. With no enemy in your direct line of sight, the spell always hit directly in front of me, but if I tried to attack a monster with it, it hit in a spot much further ahead instead. This is actually a huge problem because it's effectively impossible to aim the spell. I hope these are addressed in future updates.",
        "Only thing I ask is that u make summoner advanced classes I suggest mabey a nechromancer like summons dead can revive friends from death mabey once a day or like three idk mabey make a demon class like a underworld class where all skills are demonic in nature or a animal summoning ability this should have been thought of before class was released btw just saying otherwise amazing game 10/10 in my opinion",
        "Thank you very much Asobimo for helping me to fix my security issue.  Now i can go back to the game.  I really love Avabel!  Lovelots.",

        "Okay, I started this game like a few weeks ago and I am in love with this game! It has great story and the cats designs are fantastic! One tiny problem, the material costs of the main story is hard to get and it would take me ages without buying anything  with real money. Overall I love this game and I really hope there is going to be another competition to add another Castle Cat, it would be amazing to see more people design cats!  This is one of my top recommendations for people who want a cute and awesome game!!!! Keep it up!",
        "Well, I like this game like anyone else. But I have a suggestion-maybe you guys should unlock everyone outfit for the guild leader. I have this very beautiful outfit that is still locked and I just can't stand myself. Anyway, others are perfect but can be better. Nothing else. 😊 ( PS the cats r nice to throw WHEEEE ) #justthatlittleproblemofmine #unlessyouguysagreelikeit #heythegamesniceperfectloveit",
        "It so addicting. I played this for a while and ot os so fun! Thi is a game you shpuld want to play. It os also so cute. The only thing i dont like it that it makes u pay 10,000 dollars for a cat you may not want and u cant get ur money back.",
        "I do LOVE this game but, there a problem... my device can't load up the game anymore. I have no clue why this problem is happening ive looked at caslte cats Q&A and got nothing, i know if uninstall the game that there would be a slight chance of me getting my data back. I really want to start grinding for the easter event, but when ever i click play IT JUST SENDS RIGHT BACK TO THE INTRO! I would had rate this 5 stars insted of 4 but, the reson its 4 stars is because of this issue.",
        "It's a cute game but crashes frequently when I go to collect quest rewards or supplies. This is especially irritating when I've joined the battle or done a redo to reroll for all the quest rewards - I lose everything!",
        "YAY ME! I'M A BETA TESTER! :3 I wanted to see ratings for a long time... and it's 4.9! Probably because of the 'tap-your-tablet' functions. (those are some of the highest rating apps in market) I wanted to rate it since recent Easter Event, when I first got it. I like the quests, storyline, characters, the heroes, and Pugomancer; even though I'm a CAT PERSON! It must be the fact that he's an antagonist; I like antagonists. So, the battle system's cool, but I wish I could just use gems to speed it up sometimes. :) I really wish recourses were cheaper and easier to get. The bugs are: when I watch a video in battle, the thing skips. (like its a video that's buffering) The other issue is that (sometimes) it's kinda hard to move from one end of guild to another. Other than the bugs, great job PocApp Studios! :) Edit: Can you add more mini-games? I'd also like to read past event storylines... :)"

More things to do for random rewards like something that takes an alloted amount of time to do and it costs gold or whatever and uses builders to finish.",

My only issues are, the price of things and how long it takes to upgrade things the more you progress through the game amd of course the confusing layout but that's due to so much content.",

The only thing I find difficult is getting the resources to level up skills early on in the game also early on in the game it's really hard to raid when skills cost 3.5 rage when I can level it up to reduce the cost. Other than that this game is very awesome. I rate it 4* all around because \"nothing is perfect\".",

Also they only take gems for certain upgrades. This is a joke and shows how greedy these developers are. Not worth a dime.",

All in all, great game and keep it up devs.",

        "Ambush is based on trophies but it should be based on HQ lvl. If anyone has 1000 trophies the high lvl HQ players can attack him which is not right. Also no report option in chat as i can see people cusses a lot and misbehieve a lot on chat. For developers.... lazy as they do not respond to any query. If you are rearranging your convey then still people can attack you while rearranging. I have spent good money on this game so deserves a responce from lazy developers. So from my side only 1 star."

        "This last update (1.94.2) is f***ed. I constantly get logged out randomly in the middle of a hand and am forced to fold. Also, the filters for games have been generalized so I can no longer narrow down to the game type I want. That one is not even a bug just an awful bewildering design change.",
        "I have been playing on this site for at least 14 years now I loved it I played with real money but in last 4 or 5 years I haven't been able to play with real money I do spend reel money to buy fake chips I'm not happy with the new settings that I can't find the tables that I like to play and can't play with real money let me tell you that until you fix this and change your settings back the way it was few days ago I wound play and I Will ask all my friends that I referred to this site to stop playing and deposit.  So please fix the problem.  Thanks",
        "It's an ok app. Noticed to many patterns to believe it's random. Don't play real money unless you feel comfortable throwing it away. Most player's who seem to win are from some third world country.",

        "Not bad. Uses some pretty obscure words and doesn't give you bonus for a lot of what should be bonus words. Hard to earn coins because of this as you earn very few from solving the puzzles. Clues are expensive for the reason. TIP!  TURN OFF YOUR WIFI WHILE PLAYING AND YOU CAN AVOID THE CONSTANT ADS.",

        "Two things which needs to be corrected. If the game is played in silent mode then ads should also be silent. Second, it is not possible to check the meaning of the last word because the level ends as soon as you discover the last word."

Very engaging and fun, though a little incomplete with no compatibility with Yokai Watch Land and an inability to befriend players from other regions. Now, following some updates I really can't stand it. It's very unfair, and unbalanced. It's a money-trap, where the only way to progress is through money. There are so many pay-walls and over-powered opponents that you have to pay to beat, it's just not worth playing anymore.",

But unless you're willing to pay you have to wait for quite a while to get to play again. All of the Criminal Case games are the same way. Never been so blown away by a game insisting on paying money like this before. Very disappointed!",

Constantly bombarded by attempts to get you to spend money.     Used to be a great game by now would not recommend.  Will stop when i complete in 6 levels",
        "this game is so addicting. the only thing I hate is that they don't reward energy anymore. No drinks etc. I just wish you didn't have to buy energy to continue . otherwise I love this game. it's a great time consumer when you are borwd",
        "I played this game for a VERY long time. Recently, the creators have made lousy changes, making it difficult to get energy to play and giving us adults some stupid, useless stickers. Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice! The creators aren't listening to the players and you may want to seriously consider before investing in this game."

        "I truly love this game i have been playin it since a year ago now and it is definitely a heart taker it is a \"masterpiece tht is missing a signiture\" i believe tht u guys gave a 100%. But i am looking for a game with 110%... Basically it should include more car customizing options like rims, spoiler, hoods, etc. and i would like to see being able to sell ur cars for decent profit in the game. Not everyone wants to keep thier first minicooper lol. Maybe this is somthing tht can be included... Its 3/4 perfect",
        "Used to be one of my favorite games. Now with the update, there are no more option for multiplayer games or to speed up your purchases by watching videos. I realize that this is in part to have people download and play Version 2, which I do not care for. Some of us just prefer the original. Should leave well enough alone. Doubt I'll be playing this much more.",
        "Great game with very interesting features. However since CSR2 has been released, the game is starting to get abandoned I mean, today I checked the game in the play store and I found out it hasnt updated ever since. Still the same in the What's New tab and I bet that update was the one a year ago if im not mistaken. Pls NaturalMotion do not abandon the game that started it all! :( Notice this please I used to love this game before I played CSR2",
        "This game is one of the best on the market. With its stunning visuals, to its fast paced challenging gameplay, this is a app to have. There is only 1 thing I'd like, I want more tiers. I like beating bosses and winning huge amounts of currency. Add more and I will give it a solid 5. Great job!!!",
        "The game is excellent in every possible aspect. But I have no idea why is multiplayer gone. It was such an awesome and fantastic thing but now I ain't able to play it anymore. Though, if you did this, you probably had a reason for it, so I'm not going to convince you to hring it back, I know that's impossible. But'd atleast want to know why you did it, please answer.",
        "I think this game is great except the daily races for the bonus'. I do the races for the cash and win almost all of them but when the races are for the gold coins and I get perfect launch and gear changes yet I lose every single time. I think it's rigged and a load of trash. Needs to be re-looked at!"

So if hate the game.it is ok. I understand.so of my friends say different things than me. I do not always like things people like so yeah this game is awesome to me but maybe not to you.",

If you love the show and always wanted to be on it, this game gives you a little of that feel and satisfaction 😁 + the tech support is really friendly and responds quite timely",
        "As MUCH as I LOVE this game. It's very faulty when it comes to accounts. three times already my account has been locked due to getting new phone or accidentally trying to connect it to my Facebook. I lost over 9 weeks of hard work and dedication to this game and I refuse to attempt it a Fourth time. Uninstalling.",

Servers open about twice a week. Merge happens about every 2 weeks. Unless you plan on spending minimum 100$ US. Expect to be at the bottom of the barrel.",
        "Game is a rip off and there only worried about getting your money while major bugs and issues are all over. You try to inform them about these issues and noticed from several other players with same issues but they seem to not care or attempt to get back to you. If you search Facebook page you will see there replies to various players are just a bunch of emojis showing that they are just a bunch of immature people. Definitely do your research on this game before downloading. I don't want anyone else making the same mistake I made with this game.",

Oh LOOK A FEW SECONDS INTO THE GAME YOUR KICKIN OFF WITH FULL NUDITY PEOPLE FULL NUDITY WHAT A WASTE OF MY SPACE. Beep* uninstall NEVER INSTALLING FROM YOU IDIOTS AGAIN You STUPID RIPOFF OF EA Games. I MEAN WHO NAMES THEIR COMPANY GAME EA. Worst game EVER",
        "Well if you like games that play them selves then this game is for you. 2 stars are for graphics and storytelling in game. I would rather play old Diablo 1 than this game, you have almost no control in game, everything is auto! Auto walk, auto battle, auto sell, auto quest, auto feed pet. The only thing that breaks auto-play is messaging other players and talking to npc. Just make the game a movie its more than halfway there.",
        "Good game. can't say ive experienced the problems other players have pointed out thus far. It is crowded with lots of players but you're free to roam at your own pace. Automation in an MMO is silly but I don't mind. I also was kind of expecting Dark Souls not WoW as the aesthetic and tone. I suppose my advise would be just add more classes, more stuff to do, and encourage actual interaction with environment and players. But not a bad game all in all",
        "Not good if you want to play this game, there's always people trying to kill you if you interact with players with red on their name. Im trying to level up my character and some random people keep killing my character, you can't have a personal space while you trying to level up, I'm warning you, don't be decieved by the flashy trailer they'll do any for your wallet"

Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",
        "Love this game spent some money on it but still very fun.  They do specials on packages pretty cheap that speed things up.  Has a lot to do in it too doesnt get boring.  Good if you have a long time to play or just a couple minutes.",
        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

        "Enjoyed the game. Very fun and im actually spending which is rare for me.   I dont like the orb prices go up with each new arena. I wont be spending now im in in arena 4 those prices are just not worth it. Id also like the ability to save a few different decks. And make gold earning a bit easier its not balanced. Im in arena 4 and been saving gold for over a week not spending on anything opening orbs. And i still cant upgrade any of my cards.   Tbh as much as i enjoy the game. If i cant upgrade without spendig then ill wind up uninstalling eventually",
        "Love it! Very interesting and fun to play, but i have a suggestion. You should add some spells (Poison, Heal...). They don't have to be overpowered, just for slightly more fun gameplay! Also they should be regular cards (Heroes). And one more thing: bring some advatage to players that don't start first in the match, because it's easier to win when you are playing first.",
        "Very unique and fun strategy game. Easy to understand from the first game. Very forgiving to newcomers but if you want to get good, it takes planning and learning. Fun to pick up and play throughout the day. My only problem is that if you sit and play for more than a few minutes, you'll waste alot of orbs winning games. You can spend gems to free up slots, but I'd rather just not receive orbs until I have a free slot. Good game.",
        "I wish that your global rank was more intuitive and less complicated to acquire. Also on the achievement's it says that I can't get the last 2 stars on the found heroes however I have all that I can get. I also wish there was a pm option as the leader of a clan I want to give constructive criticism but not call them out in the chat.. other than that it fully deserved the 5 star.. thanks for makeing this and keep smashing!!😋",
        "The game itself its good, but lack of fun. To upgrade cards you need money which is hard to get in the game and from the clan. In free chest and common orbs you never get any rare cards and money is too less. Would be fun if the cards could be developed faster and if they would have a counter attack possibility when you upgrade it to certain level. You could implement a coop when each plyer choose 2 cards from deck or something similar. In addition I would change which player starts, should be based on the deck strenght. I would also implement the position of the cards on the field and which card is in front and which card in the back, by that you need to start a bit more strategic. Hope that something happens with the gameplay soon, before more players leave. Good luck",
        "Love the game. Really fun to play and balanced so even non paying players can do well. One complaint I have is the new addition of zombie has a bug, when hitting a buffed opponent the poison touch doesnt replace the buff. Please fix this issue."

And most importantly, don’t get involved. But the MC guys were honest types. I guess that was why I didn’t just turn my head. Now the Club owed me. I guess I could a joined the MC, but I preferred doing my own thing. Still, the whole appearance of these guys really impressed me. Three years later I am finally a free man again and the clink did not tame me one bit. However, it is time to start something new. Ever since I can imagine I loved living my freedom on my chopper.

A bit of extortion, a couple girls. All on a pretty good scale. In those days, I had it all! But then I got too careless and the ATF raided my crib. Luckily, they didn&#x2019;t have too much evidence against me. Still, that mess brought me three years in Rikers Island. During a yard exercise, a guy tried to knife the President of the Bastards of Hell MC. Usually, of course, the first rules in the slammer are: Don&#x2019;t see, don&#x2019;t listen, don&#x2019;t tell. And most importantly, don&#x2019;t get involved. But the MC guys were honest types. I guess that was why I didn&#x2019;t just turn my head. Now the Club owed me. I guess I could a joined the MC, but I preferred doing my own thing. Still, the whole appearance of these guys really impressed me. <br>Three years later I am finally a free man again and the clink did not tame me one bit. However, it is time to start something new. Ever since I can imagine I loved living my freedom on my chopper. My bike always was more to me than just a vehicle. So founding my own motorcycle club and painting the streets red with my fellas ever since felt natural. Together we keep the streets free of those who think can mess with us. <br><br><br>That&#x2019;s what you ought to do:<br><br>Just out of jail and free again but with your own district now that you can manage from underground it is your duty to start your career as a gangster anew and found your own mc club. Your goal must be to expand the Motorcycle Club (MC) and rule the district with the help of your biker friends. Earn money, expand your influence and attack and rob other players in game. But watch out! The cops got their eyes everywhere so always remember to briber them and be sure that they keep their eyes shut and stay out of your business. <br>With fortunes and tactic you&#x2019;ll be the king of the road and rule them with merciless severity.<br><br>In game Features:<br><br>Bloody Roads, California is a strategy and building game, that asks for strategic thinking, fortunes and tactic. These are the features you get in the game and that will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat for hours.<br><br>&#x2022;\tFound your very own MC<br>&#x2022;\tFight against bikers from other players in merciless streetwars<br>&#x2022;\tGet onto your chopper and built up your own empire<br>&#x2022;\tEarn money by running tattoo studios, bars and other establishments, to expand and built up your MC<br>&#x2022;\tTrain your bikers to keep your business going.<br>&#x2022;\tHave a blast with this multiplayer strategy game",

The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won..."

        "Honestly I was really surprised just how much this game impressed me. Fluid and easy controls to play or even to idle if that's your fancy. Constant events and everything is in a cutesy style with tons of favorites from the series",
        "This game is OK. But it's a bit confusing. And the whole, only using two characters this sucks. I can see there is some clash thing where you can use 6 of ur crew instead of random poor level characters but you can only do that for some special evet stuff once a month or something which seems stupid. I want that option all the time. Since most of the time nobody is trying to do the same level I am so I get bad bots and can't complete it. Sucks big time",
        "This rating is for the \"new\" update.... and \"revamp\" constant crashes and loss of Rainbow coins so far about 30. error s132  is ridiculous soft locking and general lag everywhere. This was a pretty good game now it's just meh.",
        "Just started playing and already starts lagging on loading screen. The lagging gets worse on missions. Not sure if I would want to continue playing based on my experience with the game",
        "The latest patch is a big improvement, but the pairing system need major work, most low level dungeons couldn't find players, and the changes to have to farm berries is a bit silly, I mean after farming character coins, skill levels, enhancement materials, now you are going to make people farm berries? That just kills any fun left in the game",
        "Hopefully the developers don't disregard this but I played through the tutorial and as soon as I got to the menu where I saw a Luffy on the ship the game crashed and now will repeatedly crash"

I asked them if I uninstalled and then cleanly reinstalled it, would I have my gun that I PAID FOR. That was the last of the conversation. Would have recommended this to anyone until now. For 3 weeks I have tried to reach them and have gotten nothing. So, HELL NO, I would NOT recommend this to anyone.",
        "I think that when I deserve a reward for doing one of the free gem missions, like downloading a game and starting it.. that I should get my gems. Also I completed a daily task and did not receive my grenade. But other than that I love this game.. just needs those things to work! And maybe if I could get those things it would be nice!",
        "Game is fun. A lot of oppurtunity to get gems if you have patience.. gameplay is really good. However too many ads.. if you offer the oppurtunity for people to watch ads to get gems then why throw in all the extra random ads that we are forced to watch? Also i sometiimes get ads appear that you cant get rid of unless you close the game and reopen it. For trhis i give it one star.. get rid of the ads and ill give it 5",
        "I have did a lot of promotions to get free gems and didn't get any! I think it's wrong that I have wasted my time on the false advertising for gems. If y'all can't honor the time people put into to get the gems... Then y'all need to take it down! Other than that, the game is fun",
        "Great game, but the offer wall with the gems sucks. I paid for an offer and did not receive my gems. Sent email to the app producer and they suggested i contact other people. The problem has still not been corrected. So beware of offer wall. Dont waste your money!",
        "Usually don't\"pay\" for games. Made a $9.99 in game purchase, went through. Started playing gun and upgrades along with remaining gems are now gone, after only two minutes of playing!! RIP off!! Took money and screwed me!! Will contact my bank if not remedy. Theft of service!! UPDATE 3/8/18 STILL NO REMEDY FROM DEVELOPER! WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY A D GAME GLITCHES AND SHUTS OFF TAKING ANY PROGRESS! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! UPDATE 3/18/18  STILL NO WORD OR REMEDY FROM DEVELOPER!!! SCAM!!!!!"

After 2-3 years, getting a mid range mobile, I installed the game once again to try it on my new android & guess what, it WORKED Flawlessly! (On Moto G5 plus) and also, thanks a lot for giving me Rewards as a returning user back to Kritika. Love you guys, you are awesome. Keep developing XD(Request: like orders & chaos 2, please try to give a open world look) thanks once again.",
        "I'll give it 5 star if only I can Recover my account. I forgot my password then when i asked Gamevil support, there so many requirement. I can't provide CS ID because I can't log in to the game anymore. Hope they can fix this. Best gameplay but sad account recovery system.",
        "Keep closing randomly on some missions on both my S8 and galaxy tab S2. Starting to get annoying.  Waste resources when it closes.  I uninstalled n install and that didn't solve the annoying problem. Waste resources anytime it force closes",
        "The game keeps kicking me out everytime i play. I cant play because the game crashes it takes me out of the game fix that and i will give it all stars it also gives me errors in the game itself for examples stamina error and free draw error I stopped playing the game because it kicks me out to much. This game crashes for android any android phone I don't understand.",
        "Server Issue!!!  Please fix your server! I'm really angry/pressured play your game! Especially event time. My connection it's really great! But why i'm always disconnected during play your game. The game is good, only the server. If you guys want people continue play your game. Do something about this. I hopefully, this problem fix as soon as possible!.",
        "A good game but can not download the latest patch after updating. I am a VIP and leader of a guild so this is troubling so until this issue is fixed the game gets just a star from me. The game has gotten worse tried to play after creating a new character and the game crashed on me, seriously gamevil you are slipping and it's a shame"

        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played and ever will play. I recommend it to everyone. Even if it doesn't look good to you get it its awsome. I think or know you will like it. Also it's so cute and the graphics are awsome. Also everything is priced so well. I love how you add new stuff often. Also you can level up fast, and let go of your purse into a new family. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!,",
        "OMG THE NEW UPDATE IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY SAW MY OLD REVIEW AND DID ALMOST EVERYRHING I ASKED THEM TO DO OMG LOL XD GREAT GAME!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁 COULD NOT B HAPPIER ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! 😝 Edit: ANOTHER AWSOME UPDATE!!! BEST WOLF SIM IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!! 😆 😆 😆 😀 😁 😁 I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN I LOVE MINECRAFT AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING COMING FROM ME!! 😀 😀 😀 😀 😃 😃 😆 😆 😗 😘 😘 I LOVE U TURBO ROCKET GAMES!! 😘 😘"

This is the best RPG game I've played yet! Wish I can record a gameplay of this, but it wouldn't work! Still love this game though, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!",

After the refresh it keeps defaulting back to americas which is very laggy for me. Would be nice to preset region settings. Overall i enjoy the game a lot.",

At one point almost 3 years ago I quit playing because I lost all of my equipment and I guess somewhere in the 2 years they finally got to my request although I never really got all of my stuff back. I am considering quitting for good at this point because I am spending money on this game and no one ever responds to my issues. BUYER BEWARE!"

My only real complaint is the chat.. my friend and I use a private chat to talk all the time while waiting for stamina to recharge, but it's pretty buggy, censoring a lot of really common, non offensive words like anything with an \"ho\" or \"is\", and for some reason the word \"ready\" is censored too.. if this could be fixed, it would be great.",

The whole game is about grinding to get good digimon but the drop rates are so freaking low! The game would be more enjoyable if the rates were higher. I don't want to be spending so much time for me to save up stamina just for me to use it in seconds and get nothing. Hopefully they change it if not then this game is probably going to be forgotten soon",
        "Great works. As a big fan im really looking forward if Bandai can also bring back the classic old school dot digivice game into modern one. Not mmorpg.. But just that classic nostalgic dot nostalgic game. I really like digimon unlimited that a fan made before where we raise one digimon in many ways. Too bad its not bandai work. I definitely play if u make one",
        "The games is really fun and i love how the systems work. There are some issues however, for example WAY WAY WAY too grindy. Thats the biggest because during events you have to commit your life to the game to progress your gamestate. Additionally if you use stones in someone else's hosted co-op game they're gone despite it not being your fault and with the tiny amount of stones you get after 3 10 captures it adds up. Needs reworks but is good over all.",
        "Most people will say that it is kinda hard to get to mega. And I think they got a point but well in my own oppinion, this game comes with its own strength and weakness. I manage to get my rosemon and wargreymon and now I'm working on my taomon. My point is. This game is good overall but it can be better if there are feature that we can do to enhance our interaction with other player. A clan or guild or something like that. Keep ap the good work and I'm looking forward to the next update."

The worst is even if I change the interface to left handed before a dual the game automatically changed the interface to right hand. And after a dual starts there is no way to access the setting to change to left hand. Please fix it! It's like forcing a left handed person to write with his right hand. I don't play duals anymore because of this problem. And I know if I don't play duals I won't get anywhere in this game. Be considerate please and fix it",

For starters, when I'm in the middle of a duel, it will straight up just kick me off and it will exit the game completely...its very frustrating. Second, why when someone is doing the duel, the opponent gets an extra 20 seconds to complete it?? I have won so many duels but since they get an extra 20 seconds, they tend to beat me when clearly I was ahead when the duel was actually over...please fix this. I really do love this game but it needs debugged to be a badass game."

        "i really liked the game it has everything to be best game. But dont be soo greedy. please make some more events and make some balance in duel or whatever because of course i cant win against someone like 45lvl when I'm 30 no? And the summoning rate is low mystery amulets are only one for a week lol i think it will take 10 years to get ssr for me. I dont want to leave this game please make something thanks you.",
        "It's a beautifully made game with a good story line involved. Sure it can be pay to win and all that, but nothing that a bit of hard work can't catch up to.  The controls are easy enough to understand and the combat system is just as simple. It does offer a few unique things such as the shared resource for bigger and better attacks, but it only adds to the depth of the combat system. All in all it's a good game and well thought out.",
        "I loved the game when I played the beta. Turn based rpg with different parables within the story mode. Unique unit designs. I cant get very far with the game because the audio echoes itself to the point where its almost hard to understand what is happening. Its a good thing there is subtitles. The game prides itself on its audio aspect by recommending \"use earphones for best experience\" before starting, and I would really love to hear the game.",
        "I used to love this game hence  I moved to the English server... having played on the Chinese server, I noticed the drop rate for this server is super low. Also the packages in the game ate way overpriced. Some skins in the Chinese server are free (ie moonlight blossom yuki onna) whereas in NA server you have to pay to get it. Honestly if the playing field is equal between the NA and the Asia server were equal, I'll stay in the NA server. Right now I'm going to move back to the Asia server even tho I can barely read the story.",
        "I love absolutely everything about this game. Its perfect...accept for one very big detail. Sadly, the characters that have unique and strategic skills are amazingly fun but will never amount to anything in pvp. The good characters are all too easy to play with and it becomes dull due to the lack of thought it takes to win. PVP is a disaster in gameplay and matchmaking. Otherwise, this game is very good.",
        "It's a fantastic game. It would be nice to lock actions so when you're on auto you don't waste orbs. You can pay alot to get more summons but it's all about grinding out the materials and taking the time to level up the guys you want. Would recommend for anyone who loves a good farm/grind game."

Sometimes I get matched with people with 2 to 3 times my health and they also have more defense so it's as if they have even more plus can 2 shot me.",

        "Good game  Except for the constant updates and also why when i use a breaker on someone(example i use laura shiba) and as she hits with her sword the strike move my opponent does still seems to overpower it..wheres the ethic in that? Lost many a battle due to this silly glitch..sort it out!! Once an attack has been made and is hitting the opponent regardless of priority moves it should still count!!",
        "Good graphics. I really wish you could sell rangers and monsters that you don't want. It is way too unorganized for me having all these warriors with flashing buttons saying UPGRADE, when I don't want to waste my coins and crystals on warriors I'm never gonna fight with.",
        "Its to much of a gamble. For example i had a match were i started of with block, defense, block. And my opponent had from the looks a breaker, breaker, attack. I got freaking trashed in seconds. Thats the biggest issue for me and like some people leaders are f@#$*** ridiculously powerful. Needs more balance",
        "I have been a power rangers fan for years until the movie came out i loved this game its detailed the controls are great and my favorite ranger of all times is Tommy Oliver the green ranger white ranger and red zeo/turbo rangers and finally the black dino ranger"

Could be fun but this game is rigged and they only want your money.   They will cheat you every chance they can.  Don't say I did not warn you",

Even if it was massively  over priced. Would be even better if you could save load outs for weapons and perks.",

        "An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It's so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I'm sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/",
        "Elder scrolls legends is a game with a elder scrolls taste and mechanics. Its choices, game modes and progress systems works perfect. It's story is great, and serve as a tutorial for the big part of the game. You can even unlock new dlc and decks through your progress in the game. This is truly a marvelous game. Problems like connection break occurs very rare and does not affect the game. If you like CCG and ELDER SCROLLS, then this game is highly recommended.",
        "Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it's very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done 👍",
        "The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn't know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on \"draft\" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they're putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.",
        "Week 1: *Going to try to make this an ongoing review*. Had to lower this to 4 stars overall, because you have to either pay or grind to access all of story mode. I'm gonna buy it, but I think it shouldn't cost more than $14.99. Just mho. PvP is fun and you actually play LIVE people, not an AI running someone's cards. Level rewards seem generous and worthwhile.  Runs a bit slow, but I know it's my phone and not the app's fault. Gameplay is very fluid and makes sense. I already like it FAR BETTER than Hearthstone.",
        "Fun game! Is very generous with card packs and rewards. Plenty of deck complexity yet easy to get into. The RnG can be troublesome at times, but I guess that's just how card games go. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy card games, specially if you're and Elder Scrolls fan."

Many mobas do the same and I enjoy putting my own spin on builds without having to sit in the shop menu in game for 30+ seconds attempting to adjust everything from the standard builds.  Just a thought.  Thanks for this amazing game. =)",

But since the update 3.1 I have been getting bad pings but my internet is pretty good above 5 mbps constant an bing are well below 50. So have been getting thumbs down for rude pings.

Vanglory is one of my favourite game in these years and i don't want to take it off from my device. Try to fix the issue pls.thx",
        "Couldn't get free rewards for halycon, I clicked on them and it did nothing. I also had a rare mystery chest key and When I clicked to use it, it did nothing, not even get rid of the key. I had to reinstall and it still didn't work, please, help. I also never got that free chest for creating a profile. Very much appreciated if you help. I also don't know how to claim my five free heroes and one skin .-. And it shows I have no wins, which I do, but please, this really needs to be fixed!! I'm sure it's not just me who is having this problem. I also can't open my EPIC mystery chest, even though I have a key. Fix this.",
        "Nice gameplay, very good looking graphic for a MOBA game, on phone obviously. Very nice and comfortable controls. Impressive multiplayer and, fighting system. But The only problem i found is sometimes i still disconnecting from games due to low internet connection, but i got a solid 10MBps speed. I hope Super Evil MC quickly fixes this up. Really irritating when im fighting with enemy hero and you just \"pop\" disconnected. The others features are just fine.",
        "50 mbps connection with 47 pings tested during gameplay. Every time i start vainglory 5v5, works well. 10 mins in the ping goes to 30000 ms. I close the game and go to speedtest to check if my network works fine. ITS BEEN WORKING GREAT THE WHOLE TIME. i get back on the game and the ping is still 30000 ms till it goes back to normal after 5 mins. 5 MINS LOST. and after the game is over? DESERTER! do not push updates when your servers cant handle it. Its been happening to many players but they keep on thinking its their nets fault. Smh..."

        "I was having so much fun with this app today after the updated it on my S3 Galaxy tablet! Seriously!! This is dope! I can't wait to level up my grade from 3 & move forward to grade 5! When I watched the ATIS video tutorial,  I was blown away! It seems that \"Expert Server\" is becoming much more awesome with their new feature added in the server!! I really can't wait to get there! This is awesome update FDS!  Great job!  Keep it up! 😊😎👍👍👌👌🙌🙌",
        "This is truly a step up over your average plane simulation games. With Global release and many changes that have taken place it truly is the best out there.  My only gripe is that there is not enough focus on African Airlines. The new update has totally been focused on American and European Airlines. Most African airlines already have aircraft listed in Infinite Flight but yet aren't added. Sad really, hence the 4 stars",
        "Its good to hear that ur asking for our feedback. First of all let me tell that u guys are doing a superb job...keep it up and lots of love to u all who developed this simulator. One request to the admins that atleast reply to what we are asking, not exactly at the same time but take ur time and reply.. previously i had asked about adding liveries to 777 300 er model no one replied or even acknowledged that ur reply has been received. I hope to get a reply here atleast.  I would like to know when u will add A350 and more liveries in 777-300er model ( would love to see air india, jet airways, china southern, china eastern, jal, ana, korean air, alitalia).. please add this liveries.. it will be awesome",

        "Played this game since the beginning, one of the biggest updates has only been made to those who have to pay an extortionate amount.  Feel robbed really and the fact I can't play the game offline, seriously? ffs what a waste.",
        "Well this is a bit atrocious. I feel entirely missold, was shown this app with the ability to fly pretty much from and to anywhere on the planet. I even had it on a previous phone and did such. Now I buy it and oh guess what? It was updated so one can't fly from one city to another, let alone another country. I mean it's pretty pointless at this point, don't think I can justify the additional £75 (per year) to enable me to actually use this and salvage some fun out of it -_-   Tl;Dr? I almost want my £5 back bc it was used for about 5 minutes - may as well build paper planes as they go further."
