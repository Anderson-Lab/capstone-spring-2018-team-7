        "Bright, colorful, addictive game play. Adorably happy graphics. Love \"Mr. Encouragement\", who exclaims \"sweet!\", & \"delicious!\" in his baritone voice. The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. ThanksüòÑ",
        "good way to teach us to be patient should we prefer to play freely.   Occasionally error.  KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",
        "entertains well. but plz try to improve the swiping feature ncz when we want to play the first or second episode ,have to swipe all over down n got fed up with that, its taking too much time to do so. its really urgent to improve that thing.",
        "Very disappointed in this app over the last several months.  Every time I go into app to play game I get kicked out.  It is not always immediate which is very frustrating because I will loose lives etc UN-necessarily."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pok√©mon and I intend to play Pok√©mon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I absolutely adore this app for it's witty, adorable characters and simple yet infinite concepts. I'm addicted! I have one issue, though. The limits on the barn and silo, frankly suck. I have eleven duct tapes but no screws so I had to pay diamonds I didn't want to spend so I could have a little flexiblility! Please fix this.",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan"

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update",
        "its a nice game, but please rate the places lil bit low, it's hard to earn money, and when we save it for a place to buy, a raid takes place... increase the spin no. also atleast from 50 tp 60... it was fun at first.. but due to all this it's becoming boring.",

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "I really enjoyed this game for a while. But anytime theres any sort of update the app wont load up. And it just so happens that whenever this occurs it's during a kill event. I cant explain how stressful this game can become if you actually commit to playing it",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",

        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "It's a really great game but there are some flaws to it. First of the game is reall laggy for me and tends to always disconnect me in a game and I fell as if the reporting thing doesnt work either because they are never really blpcled for a while but those are tge only things but overall its an amazing game",
        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",
        "The game is great but the problem is that some players bully us not good loking so why not add ads to watch them to get free robux can you please add that so that we can focus on our looks so we don't get bullued thanks üòÄ",

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time.

Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complainüòâ best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. üòÅ It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own üí∞. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off.

        "I have been playing this for 1.5 years. I love everything about this game. They always have fun events - usually 2-3 events occur at the same time. You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",
        "I love this game! I play at every opportunity I get. Thanks for helping me set up the game on my tablet. I have however, run into another issue I hope you can help me resolve. I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

        "Good game. I love the fact you can get premium crystals or gems easily and on a regular basis.  Only thing I don't like is the golden cup shots or whatever they are called. Make an option to use those gems for shots instead of real cash would be nice but still earned 5 stars. Samsung galaxy note 8",
        "I think everything is fantastic about the game, but after this last update. The loading time is 20x slower if it loads at all. Galaxy phone. I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game üëç",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the actionüòÑ. This is always an exciting game.üòâAh, always an awesome game.üòÜThis is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! üíú",
        "This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven't experienced anything toxic, yet. I've been playing for about a week and it's really great"

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "Updates keep getting stuck with the ver 3.8.1. Since it was released. Download 269 out of 269 but nothing happens after that, and a message of \"connection error\" keeps appearing. Have passed the daily log in bonus, and will probably lose the consecutive login bonuses as a result. Didn't create transfer code or link to fb account yet so may risk of losing account if I reinstall. Please fix this asap.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star"

        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",

Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",

This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",

I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAƒ∞N that SYSTEM Dƒ∞Vƒ∞Sƒ∞ON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER Dƒ∞Vƒ∞Sƒ∞ON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is üëå I love it",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs",
        "I think u guys should find a way for us(we the managers) to get tokens easier . I don't understand why winning the league or champions league only gets you money but no tokens . it really sucks"

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gda≈Ñsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Man√© in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",

Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "I am really disappointed that it takes so much to upgrade each time is insane. I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!",
        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio.",
        "Great Game! Really captures that what made SIMS fun and for mobile on the go at that! Graphics are reasonable considering it is new. When building houses the only drawback is you cant construct walls within a room, you have to work with box rooms. As well as you cant make like a out door patio without it being in a room enclosure.  All in all though I do highly recommend this game to you if youve enjoyed SIMS games in the past. Loads to do,events and updates to keep you busy for awhile."

Unfortunately, i have one issue i can't access the chat room, no messages, cant access mh own profile. It keeps saying network error even though i am currently playing the game smoothly. If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",
        "If you put gold army in your garrison troops its impossible to invade you even the attacker is highest level. Attacking castle is very costly you need to attack many times for few resources. The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",
        "I think I would like this game but somehow I have never played it or downloaded it until today but the game is not at the beginning and I keep getting kicked off as it says I have logged into another device.  Not the first time I have ran into this problem.  Please help me fix this.  I have cleared the game data uninstalled and all that nonsense.",

If you buy a package from them,  which ranges from $14.99 to $399.99, make sure you get what you pay for. ..many times you don't get everything they promise; especially with the BOGO packages.   MZ will do little if anything to correct the matter.  Also, even after you spend tons of money, if you wait long enough they will give you the same stuff for free to all players.   My advice...find another game to play. ..something more fun and worthwhile. ..and not sponsored by MZ.",
        "If you want to be at top of this game then be prepared to spend more than the price of a top end BMW in one year. I am not kidding. MZ releases major game changing upgrades every day for several $99.99 packs. Then you get tge worst customer support in the industry. Terrible software quality control and business practices that mirror drug cartels.",
        "Mz took a once decent game and ruined it.  The weekly changes are senseless change is to be gradual.  Im finally walking away.  Im done with ur bots, done with admin accts and done with daily chances.  More and more people have quit and droves more will follow.  Choke on the money u got from all  of the foolish people who actually paid.  You deserve none of it"

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "I just started the game a couple of days ago, but I'm already hooked.  Like most games, you kind of learn as you move along, but a little more guiding would be very helpful. Thanks for making a fun game! I am having a problem getting past the loading screen though. I tried clearing cache, forced stop, delete files, even uninstalling and reinstalling again.",
        "Easy to learn with loads of variables to keep it interesting. Graphics are stellar. As with most 'free' games, there are lots of incentives for you to get out your wallet; if you're as unwilling to do so as I am, you'll have to be patient. Can't fault the developers. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though",
        "I don't mind spending money on micro transactions if I like the game, and I do like this game.  But the jems in this game are outrageous, if you wanted to buy jems to buy one ship it would cost you $10-$20, depending on the ship.  Because of this, this developer won't be getting any more than the $4 I've spent on it unless they lower their prices."

Reali hope Pocket Gems will look into this matter seriously and build a better game foundation. I will review my ratings when the game is more stable.",

        "Wonderful game, all these pay to win comments are slightly misleading. There are several power ups and time reducers that come fairly easy if you participate in events. Which, the events are almost always going on so you don't get bored!  Only problem I have is that the app keeps uninstalling itself from my phone. Not sure if it's the app's fault or my phone, but it doesn't happen to any other app on my phone...",

So you want me to have a game taking up space in my phone but I'm can't play the game. So it is literally a waste of space.. developers are stupid and selfish."

Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",

I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",

The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.‚úåÔ∏è)"

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game üòÄ",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and addicting, with patience.  My only complaint is that everytime i die,  which is often,  i lose all my stuff and can never find my body again.  I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",
        "WARNING: every time you update the game, it cannot connect to your google play account for god knows how many hours or even days! The risk of losing all your progress is VERY high. If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",

I've been a loyal player from the very beginning and that's their response. I'll post a message on Facebook everyday and see how many people keep playing your game or even start playing it. lol. isn't it funny how they only have gameplay graphics and controls that you can see the rating for and not how happy users are. download war z law of survival. that game is much better and the developers actually listen to the people playing."

        "It's a good bingo game with a good amount of variety. Love the fact that you can play in different rooms and get bonuses with the puzzles! I was wondering if buying the elite pack is a one time purchase or a monthly fee. Couldn't find the answer anywhere. One tip to make it even better would be to make the tickets a little easier to get. Otherwise would give 5 stars!",
        "My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)",
        "The game itself is very fun.  However, if you run out of tickets, it is way too difficult to earn more.  Apparently, they made it easier to earn tickets but after playing many other games, the update isn't enough.  To continue playing, you must buy tickets.  I may have to delete the game which is a shame because it really is a fun game.    3/18/18... They tell you to play lower cost games to get more rewards but it doesn't.  It just takes you a bit longer to go through your tickets but you don't win anything.  Time to delete.  Graphics were great and games were fun but without tickets you can't play.",
        "Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win",
        "It's been nice...I'm happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you \"Dataverse\", I appreciate your changes üíØ ‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò† UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can't spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck",
        "I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that's  called cause usually that's the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can't  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I'm  sure it does others as well."

Im trying my best to play this game that i loved and win some good characters but why is it everytime in road to glory there is a network issue well in fact in other game modes there is none. PLEASE FIX THIS NET ISSUE WERE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO WIN BUT ENDED UP LOSING BECAUSE OF THE NET ISSUE. . Thanks. I love this game so much so please be fair.",

        "Love the app and the game it is very addictive. I love the changes to season 4; however your ticket store and CP PVP store is still bugged as I am still getting cards well below my rank. Also PVP is very buggy as I am always seeing waiting for opponent or opponent is viewing last match which isn't an option. Just wondering if there is a security team that monitors online activity because it seems like a lot of people are manipulating the network at times.",
        "I like the game but last week 2 of my cards where removed I didn't accidentally delete them. They was locked. I emailed and got told that there was nothing they can do. It is a Titan pro Neville and a beast pro Tamina can someone help me get my cards back I played a lot of games to pro them right",
        "Horrible, disgusting excuse for customer service I have ever seen. Automated response no matter the issue. Never a problem ( and there are many many many issues.) Do not let the WWE license fool you, this is NOT a company I would support and I'm not sure why WWE can't find another company to produce a game.like this.",
        "They are still plagued by PVP issues that they claim they are fixing, but never do anything about. Not worth playing as you won't actually recieve your rewards for playing, and they won't help you if you send in a help ticket. You will only get form letter responses. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages üòî please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

        "It's pay to win for sure. However, if you play daily and stick to monthly and quarterly cards you'll rack up gems and heroes quickly. It took me over a year to get my VIP high enough to get the monthly meta heroes. I get an hour or two a day out of it and even when I didn't have the monthly paid heroes I had a fun time. I don't mind spending $15/month for the amount of time the game helps me kill.",
        "I'm a paying customer, which they call \"VIP\" but you best believe you are far from important. I had an issue with a purchase in December, but support takes a week per message to reply and isn't useful at all about the issue and tells you they can't help. Should have let Google refund the money before the 48 hours instead of giving their support a chance.",
        "Don't download the game . If u want to win u must spend thousands dollars. A huge skins with control every month 2 new heroes with amazing power. Every month making new heroes and the old ones getting trash. Random game no strategy. Just click for pic. Ucool don't do anything. Don't download!!! I played more than one year and every month it's getting worst. The forgetting about players. They think only for cash. Ucool one of the worst organisation..if u don't spend a money please don't start the game .nice pictures  and that it )))",
        "This game was a very well balanced game between free play gamers and those that put money into it. Not anymore. If you want to be competitive you must put handreds of dollars each month (no joke). Very dissapointed in the way this game has become.",
        "A very good game but a pay to win. I myself paid 73$ and I am VIP 8. This game can be fun without paying but to get the most out of it atleast  buy an annual card for 30$. If you have even more to throw away try buying all the cards when they run out get a new one. (Mainly Annual and Season Card. Week card isn't a must have). Also if you are new to the game wait for a new server to start. That way you wont fall behind. I am on server 210 and have also played on server 207. I was in this game when it was brand new and purple heroes were the best. I was in 1 of the 1st servers and f2P I quit the game at lvl 50 though. All in All if you want to play this game prepare 100$",
        "The menu is very unresponsive when scrolling. Also, when killing enemies, particularly after using a special ability, the enemy simply freezes and then fades away - there's no animation for the death of the enemy and this is disappointing and detracts from the immersion. Otherwise it's a good game, but significantly more heroes would be necessary to keep me interested."

        "This game is amazing a full on batlle with strategic ways to beat your opponent. The only thing im concern with is not seeing much to do in an alliance than donating troops. I would like to see a way were you can team battle and get awards but other than that its a five star game",
        "This game is amazing! But enemy units keep getting stuck behind walls Also there are a few enemy lands that are not responding when you tap on them. This didnt happen before.  I think updating attack list would be good. So you could see who you have attacked, not just who attck you. Just  a thought",
        "It's a great game but I think it be better if you created workers and mined,  lumbered, and gather favors or technology like warcraft use to be like.  The commands are also touchy and the battle displays for viewing if kinda difficult to  keep up with. But it's fun and a little bit addictive.",
        "Amazing graphic but really poor gameplay... Even lowest level, it's hard to complete easy campaign. Every win need to paid. Useless to raid... Uninteresting how the mission needed to complete... Disliked this game bcoz of the poor gameplay and the way of how to complete the mission.",
        "Ive been playing this game a very long time now. definitly a 5 star game in every aspect. only issue is.. i spend money on this last event.. 3 raids left to get 14k reward for the 4 star poison ranger.. the bloody game hang again..manage to log back only when the event was over..!!! Now i have this 2 useless relics taunting me.. Almost felt like deleting the game..",
        "One of these game where you need to pay to play if you want to be any good, slow if any support. If you don't have a life, you can get good a this game real quick. If you have low self-esteem, stay away, experience gamers will tear you a new one repeated, makes progressing to new lvls  slow."

        "Not a bad game but it's typical like some other games. It starts off with the levels being super easy, letting you build your confidence to get you thinking you're really good.  Now I understand the higher the levels the more difficulty there is but not to the point where they make it almost impossible trying to get you to buy more chances. Another words they're trying to get you to pay to win and advance not necessarily on skill level. Very sneaky. Uninstalling. It's fun for a while but overall I do not recommend.",
        "Love this game, but it freezes up. I go to try and reinstall it after a few days but it won't let me reinstall the game. Just stays at the same  level last completed. Still having the problem of when having to reinstall I lose all my lives and charms. Love the game but hate ,owing all my lives and charms",
        "I love this game but damn, why does the videos seem to always freeze up. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good game and all, so why don't you guys just fix the glitches. Thank youü§î",
        "The update took me from level 400 back to level 1 very upset be first I wasn't getting my daily play rewards so I figured like everything else it may need to update and the update blow my whole progress. I'm so pissed is there a way to fix this?",
        "I actually enjoyed the game and would give it four or five stars except 200 coins and multiple items were taking away simply because I got logged out if Facebook. Also several levels were lost.... This I understand, glitches happen. What I don't understand and don't accept is the lack of response from the developer. I've sent several emails and have yet to get a non automated response.",
        "I installed the game about 3 times and gave up. Can't connect with Facebook and when playing it suddenly stop and say it's not responding."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - ¬£8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

        "To the guy that says stop bitching cuz it's free. Reviews are so they can get feedback to improve the game. What good is the game if you can only play 2 games a day? There are too many other games out there that are free that customers can get chips to play for hours. This game should take care of their loyal customers before they move on to some of the other games. So many have posted about the small amount of chips received and they added the spinning wheel, maybe by reading the reviews they are listening and trying to improve chances of getting more chips. If everyone continues to give low reviews, maybe just maybe they'll increase our chances to get more daily chips!",
        "Purchased 90 rockets pack. Explained to me how I used all 90 in one game? Smh, that's too much.. So y'all want ppl to purchase rockets each hand. Y'all can do better. Chip packages as well. Maybe u will get more to contribute to the game. Smh, better chip packages probably will definitely help this game. Especially the price of chips to play verses what the rooms payout... Really is at a disadvantage to players to even purchase.",
        "I usually love this game. However, today I decided to treat myself and purchase some chips to get the last two battle ships that I needed to get 800 chips. The game is so frigging rigged it's just sad. It took all 600 chips that I bought and all that I won trying to accomplish a goal.  I will NEVER purchase chips again, especially in this game.",
        "Most of my purchases lately have been strange disappearing chips and rockets i have spent SO much  money on this game!!! and another thing i could not access any games for 2 days now but it TOOK ALL MY CHIPS AGAIN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU IN REGARDS TO THIS.",
        "Good variety of games. Not many free chips once the first few rounds are played when compared to what the rounds cost. Be ready to buy, buy, buy if you aren't patient. They have added many more chances for free chips. Thank you guys.",
        "I love the game again.  I'd been struggling with glitches and now they're fixed  I'm especially loving the free chips you give sometimes daily!  I've become re-addicted to it!  The new format IS easier to see, but it gets slightly boring when the two cards you CAN daub don't get any numbers!  It looks as if you're phasing out the gems, which is fine with me; I'd rather have all free daubs, chips, and only a FEW coin power plays.  The free daubs make all the difference between winning and losing.  Also, would like to see winning bingos actually give me the items I need to complete rooms and for you to increase the daily chips for every completed room."

I also want to ask when will you give Odin a uniform? A better skillset, a heal, and a piercing ability for him to shine again as a god. Looking forward to it Netmarble.",
        "There are some incredibly predatory practices with the in app purchases.  For example, if you buy the new Emma Frost pack, you won't get her work fully leveled gear, and that isn't made clear on the purchase screen.  You will need to buy the package at least once, and possible multiple times over to actually advance her.",
        "Give credit to where credit is due. You guys are taking a step into the right direction. It is a small step, but still, it shows us that you listen. So please listen to us more. The game needs improvements on existing game modes that is becoming stale and boring and repetitive. Most players are also waiting for new game modes. This new update, Version 3.9, is like sending a message to your players that you are listening to them, and that is a good thing.",

        "Love this little game! I wish we had five life's, Three just gets me started. But overall, it's a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don't make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!",
        "Very hard and not as fun as the other games but  because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I've noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level. The most amazing part of this game are the graphics.  Awesome really awesome.  Very well done. Still playing this game but also still cannot convince my friends to get out of CC and other games. Will keep on trying though.",
        "This game is set up to STEAL a certain number of lives before you can win a level. Some levels, like Venice, level 79 may never be won. I have bought extra lives twice, extra moves twice, I REFUSE to make anymore purchases. If this was a truly user friendly game, it would BANK any extra moves, lighting, and other bonuses you've earned but did not use. But no, it throws them out. STEALS what you have earned. BANK it for me, I earned it, I should get to keep it. I'm done with this game.",
        "I am glad for the staff at big fish they did a wonderful job getting me back play after all my levels where lost.. They found them all and it made me happy that i can play where i was.. I can not play to often sometimes and had taken me a long time but look forward to every new city i get to open a new and all the challenges i get to participate in.  Thank you all for this game",
        "Fantastic game!  I love the graphics and interesting bits of trivia shared every time a landmark is built.  I also like the extra daily challenges and the special events that open up every so often.  Gummy Drop is challenging but can be played without needing to make any in-app purchases.  One con: the game starts you with three lives (lives replenish after 20 minutes), but in order to permanently increase your lives to five, you must pay $10.",
        "Surprisingly fun! I was setting the ads for this game everywhere but thought they were really unappealing. Work on your ads a little to emphasize the fun prizes for completing levels, the enjoyable hunt for tour letters in old levels, the history of the buildings you save! So many great things happening in this game."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",

Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned",
        "Not only are the graphics realistic, there so persise on everything. They even allow you to purchase different variety of guns. I just wish they let you assemble your own gun, which of course accessories. Best sniper game I've ever played."

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers.

        "It's all about taking your money. You can only make the decision you want (still decided by them) by using gems. If no gem, just follow the drama. The story is just ok, not that good, it's just another money sucking app. Go read a novel.",
        "It would be awesome if you could choose your characters sex and sexual preference in all stories. Demi Lovato's Path to Fame is the only one which has the option to choose.",

Good rewards and all but, issue I have is I play a certain slot game longer than people who join later and they win large amounts immediately whereas about 90% of the time I lose chips more than win....I even switch up my bets and have bought chips thinking this would get the game to allow wins and nothing. Wanted to get enough V coins for Cirque but rather just pay full price at this point.",
        "I'm 6 levels shy of level 2000 and I just wanted to know if the daily reward and the hourly rewards will ever go up??? That'll be a great opportunity for players who reach a certain level in the game to collect a higher amount of money!!!   Also, how about EVERY weekend you'll do a DOUBLE YOUR MONEY when buying money!!!  That why you'll be making more money and customers can and will be very satisfied ever weekend...   P.S. THANKS FOR THE AWESOME GAME üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",
        "It's cool, but one of the gimmicks is that you can play with other players, the problem is there is absolutely no way to play with your friends, you can only see the progress / help / be helped by complete strangers. Even if you invite a friend through fb... nothing. Not worth downloading until they update it.",
        "21 million in coin, the new game popup hi low comes on. I play, I go back to my game all coins gone. The Emerald 7 kept playing while i was gone evidently. But how does 21 million disappear with a bet of 300k in less than 5 minutes. This is second time I have tried this game. It just wants you to buy coin, jokers.",
        "If you have any problems with your chips, dont expect them to help in any way. I was losing chips after bonus game on cleopatra. They pretty much said its my fault."

        "Like ot a lot. Taskforces need to be improved drasticly. Focus on playing with others makes it a lot more fun. EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Update: Now it won't even open. Once you find out your progression is rigged, the fun wears off. You will have a win streak going, them \"mysteriously\" a machine will show up with just the right set up to beat yours. Then once you finally get the right configuration to beat that one (however long that takes) another machine with the perfect set up to beat yours shows up again preventing you from progressing. Over and over and over....",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete."

It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "House Of Fun Slots is the Best Slot Game you will ever play and I  promise that you want to play this and once you give it a try you will never want to put it down. I deleted all the other slot  games because they  can't  compare to  this game.  If I  could  give it  more then  55Ô∏è‚É£  star's üåü I most  definitely would.",
        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm"

        "I love playing this game. It is now my favorite phone game of all times. I have seen other reviews about waiting for energy takes too long. It does take a long time but to me that is part of it. It makes you slow down and enjoy simple fun. Too be honest all of us need to slow down and enjoy life around us. I play it on my breaks at work. The way you play this game allows for  short or long periods of play . Also it's quite fun seeing the little guy demolish tiles. It truly is an awesome game. I have recommended it to family and friends.",
        "I deleted all of my games except for Diggy's Adventure. This is my favorite game. I am going to play this game until me and Diggy win, and then I'm going to play it again from scratch. Google should make a whole lot of games like this. They are way better than match 3 puzzle games. I love cats I wish they could make a kitty's Adventures game like Diggy's Adventure.",
        "I've played this game for almost 2 years and have not once had a problem and have spent a lot of money. For some reason it's now crashing every few mins. I don't lose progress or anything but it's getting frustrating to have to keep restarting. I've even updated the app on my Android. Please help? It's my favorite app and I just want to dig!",
        "I really like this game but... It has been glitching A LOT for me lately. While I am playing it will freeze my phone. If I walk away for just a few seconds it freezes. My favorite glitch is after I watch a video for energy and before I use it the game kicks me out. Upon my return the energy is gone and I can't get energy for 2 more hours. üòê",
        "Very addictive game but you spend more time waiting for energy than playing. When you have unavoidable tiles of over 400 points it doesn't take long to lose all your stored energy. I thought games were for playing, not waiting around. It's play for 5 minutes wait for an hour. It's a shame because some of the puzzles are quite good.",
        "I love this game. It's super addicting and best paft..you don't HAVE to spend money on diamonds or add ons to actually play. I really get bored of games when all they want is more of your hard earned money. So keep up the great work."

But, there's not enough energy or chances to win energy or earn it. 10 isnt enough!There's times when I'm out of energy and have done everything I can do and have to leave the game but still feel like playing. I've spent money on this game but I don't always have money to buy energy or coins to buy energy. There should be more give-a-ways, prizes, little games, etc to earn more energy so I can keep playing!! Also, I'd like to be able to friend request other players and send them things. Like people on my team on here.  Thank you! Lynn Mauger",

Would keep people playing more and they would have more purchases! That's how I'd rack in the bucks if it were my app!",
        "2ND UPDATE: 3/21/18- Thank you for adding new bathrooms and bathroom rugs! Thank you also for giving new, unique furniture on 5th or 7th consecutive days. Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",
        "I like this game but it's frustrating how it's hard to get stars and then they want you to waste them on things like giving the cat a bath... I want to decorate the house not do all the silly side things."

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

Also, the club coins could be a little higher. I send gifts to both friends and club members daily, but they're not enough to truly help anyone to continue to play.  But besides that, I just love DoubleU casino. I've been a member since practically the beginning and I will remain a faithful user! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",
        "This game is the biggest ripoff I have spent 100s of dollars of real money for nothing lost it all. Never get a Jackpot. A huge scam all they want is your money. No fun playing when you lose all the time really sucks would not recommend to anyone. I know you can't allways win but once in a while would be nice. Thanks for nothing Double U Casino.  Nicky",

        "It's a great game.  The problem I have is you get screwed out of your prizes from time to time.  And then when you contact support you have to wait for 2 days.  Then you get a message assuming you dont understand how the game works and a thanks for understanding.  So the poor customer support is what got this game it's 2 stars from me and the prize screws.",
        "I have 1 level 20 T. Rex, 1 level 10 T. Rex, and a level 10 Pteradon and I STILL can't beat it. It's pissing me off. Do I need to have 3 fully maxed out T. Rexes in order to beat this stage? It's stupid.",
        "It was good at the beginning then I  got to a high level and it started kicking me out. I still have the same problem.

Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

Thank you! Came back to update on my experience with this game. Over a month paying no  surprises, no adds, no asking to rate it just wonderful. Challenging at times than easyer and so on. Congratulations to the creators of this game and keep up the grate job!!! I am at the level 126!",
        "I am at level 218, since the recent update I am unable to play, screen goes to loading the level them just keeps loading, I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times with the same result. There's a glitch that I wish would be fixed before I decide to uninstall for good. Lost all of my gold bars, all of my cherries upon reinstall. It's a shame.",
        "Used to love this game. Now game is too difficult. Have to repeat level over and over again to move on. It is no longer fun to struggle at each level. That is frustrating...not relaxing.",

        "I lost  300+ gold & 700+ cherries after the game crushed last night. worst update ever   UPDATE 20 MAR: Would you please add a comfirm message when using 10 golds for play on? I have to restart  saving for  golds after the evil update, and I just lost all the 40 golds by wiping play on accidently due to slow respones of the game."

        "It's a great game, addictive. You get let down though if you're like me and won't spend money like others... they'll end up whooping ya",
        "2d just like pictures. Pay $$$ to be able to kill people. No teamwork. If you don't pay $$ you will end up deleting your app. People spend $1000 of dollars.",
        "Lost my game when my phone crashed. Any way to restore? Still using the same device",
        "Not a bad game although it could do with a lot of expansion like increase max levels to 300 instead of 30. Put real investment properties that generate different amounts of income such as restaurants, casinos, beachside properties etc. Add more equipment and even vehicles like Hummer, armoured truck to boost your attack and defense",
        "Very addicting ,Great Game love it ,it's the GodFather so i wouldn't expect less,you guys are awesome don't never forget that and thanks for such a Great game.Much Respect for the entire Team who has helped create and develop this Game‚úäüòéand always to the GodFather."

Either the makers of the game are idiots or the game is stupid and seriously 2000 per month for an imaginary egg everyday that cannot guarantee a 4 or 5 star bird. Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",

        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",

        "Really enjoy this game but its very hard to do well unless you pay real money to buy extras! There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "The app is really good. It's addictive. But, I really feel they should give out cash or diamonds more easily. If we could earn diamonds or cash for watching a video then it would be great. Cause it takes time for the looks to get voted and until then we cannot play and wait for the diamonds. It's kinda sad. Hope they'll look into this.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5‚òÜ"

        "Game is amazing Love it. Customer service well you have none. All you get is automated message and no way to speak to someone about any issues. You give them what they need and no one fallows up on it. All you get back is the same automated response. Then they remove your ticket. So if you have problems with the game don't bother contacting them it's a waist of your time. THERE'S NO ONE THERE FOR YOU. Can't get my account back. That's all I want. It's simple NO???????",
        "Another month, another violent smash and cash grab. Putting an entire LT behind a character requirement that 99.9% of the player base has next to no chance of getting with obfuscated \"odds\" that require one to spend 1000s of dollars for a \"chance\"(not even guaranteed) to get a character. At this point, I'm only updating the game to keep my reviews more relevant and higher weight.",
        "It's a good game. Awesome graphics, great gameplay,amazing superstar etc. But not good for free player because you don't get good superstar and rate of getting better superstar is very very low. Even some time in 4 pulls. I didn't get any 2 star silver card. Please make rare superstar drop rate more or I can't go any further in this game and make this game more free player friendly.",
        "Basically I have been playing this game over the past year... It is a totally addictive and 100% entertaining game... Only downside which has forced me to stop playing is that I have just acquired a new phone and attempted to load the game with my login details (for both Facebook & Google) but have found that I now have to start from the beginning again... I've now become mildly disappointed unless this can be fixed I don't think I will be playing again as I put too much time into this for me to start from the beginning again!!!",
        "It is my favrt game ever when i play this i stuck with this game I want to say something  now it's giving  too many ads and a problem  when I log out it says only one thing again and again that this account using on another device  but it's not real and what I do I am help less and I can't get new powerful superstars üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠when I open with cash he always give me duplicates.. Give some new cool events like wrestlemaina T-shirts..",
        "Love playing this game until google services crashed my phone and when I came back on to the game after having to reset everything, I lost access to my account. I have contacted customer services and all they do is send a pregenerated message that answers and resolves nothing!!  5 days and still receiving the same message back.. Even my faction leader has provided information to determine that my account is indeed my account and that I am active in his faction. But still SCOPELY send the same annoying generated message. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICES EVER!!!"

I'm just getting tired if going to jail....then have to start over....when I could have money when I get out.....so I won't have to depend on a job when I get out.... I can live off my money ...but then continue having my money work for me",

        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!üòâüòÑüòÅ!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.üòä"

Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",

I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. üòÇ Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. üòä",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I've really enjoyed reading All the Wrong reasons.  The author is very talented, a true story teller.  As I was reading I felt like part of the story I was so enveloped in the lives of the characters they were alive and real. I was sad when the story ended wanted to keep reading.  I was overjoyed when K. I. S. S.  came out by that very sane author who transported me to a whole new world yet again. I look forward to reading more from this amazingly talented storyteller!!",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked."

No way of contacting support/help desk either as just get error message when trying. Hugely disappointed after all the months of playing!",
        "Should have longer time on the tradefest. Not everyone has time to just sit on the game 24/7.  More opportunities to win things. Don't like how I have to pay to plant my own crops on my own island though?! And why has the harvest count changed? Why make bad changes to the game? It just shys people away.",
        "Loved this game and the players in it. BUT if you are not in their beta test group it's getting discouraging that you are not treated as equal as the others and you need to put much more effort and time to get rewards and move along in the levels. Don't start unless you like to be treated with no respect at all",
        "Well the game is great!! This morning when I was using it tho the time it would take for things to be done was reduced greatly, everything was 2 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins and 15, and I was impressed and decided that if its a new update I'd glady play more often. The second time I went back on everything was back to the old time period of production. I was disappointed and didn't bother to spend even 5mins more on it. I believe everyone would find it more exciting to play if the time for production wasn't so long. I hope that this can happen in another update, if not, well I can't do nothing about that.",
        "Gave it a lower rating because I sent 3 messages to support regarding loading error and never received a response just kept sending me to the games web page which was of no help. Very fun game but no support it seems",
        "I love this game! It is my favorite! I like how can earn gems! I love the different 'contests.' However, I tried really hard to get the snowy owl and didn't make it in time. Now I'm not playing as much but still love the game!"

The rewards for victory are so small it's almost impossible to upgrade your base unless of course you pay for a shield,but even that's a scam cause with a shield you can't atracvk enemy bases.  Everything is basically pay to upgrade or spend forever trying to save up and even then. Bottom line ftx games are a scam. A shame too I really liked the game at first. But once you start buying stuff for it, it keeps you in a position where you have to keep on paying to have a chance.",
        "Great fun",
        "Waste of time and money. You watch adds for a speed up, nothing happen, you install other apps for gold, nothing happen, you submit a report to customer service,nothing happen, they send back problem solved and they didn't do anything about. I bought gold for the app from one of their sponsors, nothing happen. I report it , a girl named Daria sent me back a email and said problem solved, guess what...NOTHING HAPPENED",
        "Total rip off dont waste your time or money. Ever since update..its horrible. The developers will swipe your gold away (basically your money) and give an excuse that your bank or Google issued a refund. After showing and providing evidence that your never received a refund...they do nothing about it! Straight run around. And good luck talking to support..generic responses like the one they give on here.",
        "This was the best Game i ve ever played but every new update creates alot trouble and tension of users. Forta spoiled the games fun. Now they want people to spemd money on scorpion. When they make them. They will introduce a sicario for that too... really dissapointed with tge way you people robbing money ftx.",
        "obvious cash grab. game is dragging without gold. you play for a few seconds/minutes and wait for hours. not enjoyable at all. uninstalling this p.o.s."

        "New Review because of update: ¬∞ I really love this game. I'm hooked. Relaxing yet stimulating. Some levels are easy as cutting through soft butter with lots of delightful bombs and others take several tries to master and need that one devise a strategy and some others are much up to luck. I love that variation: relaxing and stimulating and sometimes a bit frustrating. ¬∞ I had finished all the levels of version 2 and then waited for an update which came with new levels and I finished them also about 4 weeks ago. I've opened the game every day since to see if yet an other update came, and yes, yesterday it did and have already finished all levels (that says more about my fanaticism than it says about the difficulty of the game). ¬∞ I appreciate the tournament (I topped the monthly yesterday but had dropped 3 steps while I was sleeping and have clawed my way back to the top this evening, but I guess I'll be back down tomorrow. But it's fun! And I got generous daily prizes. ¬∞ And I love the new version that even though I again have finished all levels, I can just go on playing thanks to the Level Tower (even if it at 46 repeated a previous level). ¬∞ Lovely graphics, good game sound.",
        "Annoying and boring. Got headaches playing this. You can spend 5 sets of 5 lives each without passing the task. It's rather a \"Push to pay or wait forever\" game. Uninstalled. Sorry.",

Where is the option to play with my friends? Also, any crew creator option? So far , 4/5. Started yesterday",

Your replies seem to be automated with certain words triggering certain responses. Sort your stuff out people, get your house in order and give us what we deserve. Our legendary bonnet head. I will be uninstalling if you don't come around",
        "Fun game. Good graphics, and overall good fishing simulator. However, its ridiculously rigged. I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",

        "This game is so AWESOME! This game will also teach you alot about the fish you are catching. Great time killer. Just becareful you'll kill to much time. LOL I just realized it's 2:04am. I have to be at work at 6:00am. Download this game now! Thank you for making an AMAZING fishing game. Hats off to the creater's",
        "This game is great and what it does, massive castles sprawling battles across the ages with wizards on dragons back firing missiles at unicorns below... Erm it's fishing they lured me in and I'm hooked, what else is there to say. Great game.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin üò¢ I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "I just bought a golden crate for 100 golds, only to get a muscle ECU uncommon part. Disappointing,  no blue prints. Even in a free crate you get blue prints.  Frustrating the reward system is horrible. Am never going to buy any golden crate. Players should be given choices to buy golden crate but you get trusted upon with useless worthless part. Otherwise good game",
        "The game is pretty good, being a free mobile game, it is not trying to hide it's PTW features, but you can do mostly everything without having to spend a penny. One suggestion I think needs to be put in place is a confirmation window when you go to skip a level, because I was doing the speedhunter event for the Mazda MX-5, and accidentally hit the skip race button and lost a lot of gold, maybe not letting me even get the upgraded car now."

        "It would be nice to find a better way for allies to communicate via voice chat. Communication is key to victory and should be given to those who earn it and are serious about the game and want to become the Elite. Overall a great game even after 3+ years of gameplay. You will make tons of friends here so join already ;-)",

        "Good game but needs a fair play policy players level 80 are attacking players  at really low levels not giving them a chance to build up.",
        "Plarium do not like Aussies. They charge us extra money for offers.   A top end offer is $100 USD for the Americans. Which is $120-125 AUD after currency conversion for Australians. Yet for some reason our offers are $160 AUD. $35 AUD more then we should be paying.   I do not know how this practice has gone without incident as I thought there were supposed to be good anti descrimination laws and consumer laws in place that prevent the charging of extra to countries just because they do not like that country.   This is a morally disgusting practice as it is the same concept as charging more to others purely on the basis because they have a different skin colour, gender or religion.   I want to know why Australians are paying an extra $35 AUD then we should be as other mobile games. One example being Battle Mobile do the correct currency exchange rate and only charge $125 AUD after conversion from $100 USD. If other mobile games do it correctly why are Plarium choosing not to?  Edit: @ Plarium employee who just lied in response to me. Plarium set all prices up themselves through Google Playstore. NOT Google.",

It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! üò† Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

Otherwise it's a great game and it provides me with hours of fun and relaxation.",
        "I have been playing this game since 2012. It used to be great, but in the past 1-2 years it has become insane. The events are ALWAYS overlapped with 2-3 events happening simultaneously, and they have become much more difficult to complete. It is literally impossible to collect every dragon without spending some big bucks, and the only way to enjoy this game is to focus on only getting the dragons you like. This still proves to be difficult given the 1000+ dragons released already...",
        "Game is ok easy to follow and play. Constslly full of ads and server sync so takes forever to get in if its lets you in and then start the ads, annoying request from side ventures to get more cash from you. Apple verson has more and programers to lazy to do same here but make you compete against them",
        "This game is getting better and closer to equal to ios but still needs some work. More dragons should have their own type and not all mashed into the star. Also all buildings and arena need this the type chooser. More mining land and better crops are needed. Please fix the emoji so android can use its system wide color emoji now. Out of curiosity why does ios get a new description announcing the codex and Android is always bug fixes. You guys could just copy and paste that but don't even bother to change for us Android users?",

        "Been playing for few years now. Used to be great game but now when I play all of a sudden the game freezes and everything Ive done in last minute or so disappears. I thought it might be my tablet but after purchasing new tablet the problem still exists. I now know its the game as I have noticed that when game freezes and then restarts, I have a progress sign appear and when I click on it it tells me the progress of a dragon that gives you two gold as a reward but I am doing nothing to trigger this. This is seriously frustrating when using a boost on bingo leagues as the countdown doesnt freeze. Fix this and it's 5 stars all the way."

        "Challenging game against live players. Lots of contests and bonuses. Levels of play from beginner to world class. One drawback: all levels are open entry, so more experienced (and less ethical) players will enter into Beginner to collect quick victories. The designers should change the game so that once a badge is completed, players should not be able to enter games on that level again. This would be fair play for beginners, encouraging them to continue playing. Hope this is implemented in an update.",
        "Game graphics and play are great. However dice rolls are seriously flawed. Doubles way too often. Not even close to real rolling. I've seen 2 sets of doubles in way to many starts of the game. If doubles are so common why don't you ever see 3 doubles in a row to start. Don't ever leave a piece open because the next roll will knock you almost every time. The developer obviously likes frustration proven by the childish limited chat emojis.",
        "They need to fix the dice roll. Its absolutely a big cheat...no way can some roll exactly what they need to get out of a tight position that often. Its really horrible it ruins the whole game.",
        "I think it's safe to say based on the dice timing, that this game app, like all the rest, is favoring a particular player in order to end the game quicker. The auto play is annoying and not possible to turn off.. but the layout is nice.",
        "It's the worst game i have ever played , they are thieves , when you double and you lose they deduct twice the bet and when u win they only give you 45 percent of ur total winning money.I played a game and won 255 thousand , but they only gave me 120 thousand , and when i lost they took out 255 thousand from my money.If you dont believe me count ur chips and see.They suck so go to hell with this lame unfair idiot game.",
        "The dice rolling is not random at all !  It gives ridiculously lucky dices and game over in 3 or 4 turns. Do not play it. NO RANDOM DICE, NO FUN AT ALL !!!"

        "Dear team, It's really a awesome game ever. I'm playing it since 2 years. Very addictive. But i request you to all, when we start a TEAM RACE many players join clans for playing team race n take efforts in team race for getting better reward but many of them team leaders kick players just before ending the team race n players won't receieve any reward for it. It was happened with me 2 times. So please do any update for those players who take much efforts in team war and then also they get nothing. Thanks",
        "This game used to be 5 star. They've changed it where all team events are gem sucks. You have no chance of winning without using a considerable amount of gems. They've taken away most in game free ways to get gems, and to buy them is not worth it, they're very over priced. It's not a team event, it's a paid for event. If they change it and make it more fair for everyone I'll make a new rating.",
        "It's a nice game with so many awesome monsters. I like it and it's my favourite game in this category. My suggestion is that if you can include an option to cancel ongoing breeding by giving gold or gems or without anything, it would have been better. The game has events that comes very frequently, it helps so much in getting new monsters and or progressing in the game.",
        "The game is awesome! The game play, the monsters, and also the actual fighting and graphics. This is one of my most rated games and my most played; I couldn't go a day without it. It's competition is so good online with people and in dungeons and the map, also team wars are fun with your friends. Get this game you'll never regret it.",
        "DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. Recently my account was reset due to the game posting the wrong price of gems. I have lost everything even the things I paid full price for. I have been robbed of gems, cells, gold, food and my time. If you do play the game, don't spend actual money because they can take it all away. BE CAREFUL"

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

        "I have played this game for years now. Great new levels, still challenging, and fun ways to earn power-ups without having to make a purchase! Loved it until it quit working on my phone. Doesn't even crash anymore, just quits mid-play and I lose whatever progress I'd made. I play when I can on my tablet, but it's just not the same. I don't know why it won't work on my phone without spontaneously closing! 5 stars if it did...",
        "I love, love  this game is difficult to play, but to my opinion is the best game on line ihave been playing for 2 years and my goal is to beat it . you get rewards. I spend money but with the rewards you get something back  ,also I just started another game with is similar like pandapop and iam a also give it 5 stars . even that iam a grandmother of 72 years old. I still popping. !!",
        "A wonderful game to have very fun and exciting install right away you won't regret it. I've reached level 1049. It is super exciting to me learning how to Ricochet the balls off the walls. The projection of the angle need it. This is my all-time favorite and I highly recommend it to my friends and family. Plus, the little bit of flaws and the enemies within the game, will have you taking a break and coming back for more. Just know that I've deleted this game twice but always came back to it because this game , is fun and challenging .  If you don't like a challenge you won't like this game .  Just so you know , it does not require internet, to be able to play this game like others. Technicians please put out more games that don't need the Internet to play. This game is one of them. Just know that option is super helpful. We need more games able to be played without internet intervention. Ty taking time to read this. Have fun a Poppin. LOL",
        "Not bad, not great. Randomly stops in the middle of play and you lose a life. Also takes a long time to load and to move to the next level. Okay for free, but if I paid for it I would be asking four a refund.  Update: I've contacted the developers multiple times. They keep sending the same canned response.  Game crashes frequently. Frustrating when you are just about to finish a level. Uninstalling.",
        "I use to give this a 5 star rating until I lost all of my panda belt progress when I updated, 5 days ago. I sent a report to you and got a message that said there was a problem with the update. I'm still waiting for an answer on when this will be fixed. I refuse to play any levels or specisls, like badboon lair until I can receive the panda belt credits. If I don't receive the panda belt credits or if I am not credited for the points that I lost I will uninstall this game!!!!!",
        "I loved this game and have played it for a few years now. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the last few months, it just closes on me mid play and I lose on my progress, as well as any items and special powers that I used to advance in a level. Very frustrating to lose items and have to start all over on the level."

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

        "The game itself is wonderful, but I've had this bug ever since Chapter 2 or 3 (I just finished Chapter 12) where when I finish the final level, the screen goes black and won't play the cutscene. I end up having to close the game and never get to see it, then I go into the next Chapter not really knowing what's going on. The story is important to me and it's very unfortunate that this is happening. A fix from the developers or a suggestion on something I can do would be greatly appreciated.",
        "Really enjoy this game.  Just wish we could pay for land expansions because they don't come fast enough.  Running out of room to place everything.  Yes they have the cargo ship but you lose points for doing that.",
        "I play whenever I can. Very Enjoyable!  Love both searching scenes and decorating my island. Love being able to rearrange, and I wish I could move the gifts I receive.  Don't like waiting the 4 hours to regain energy and I would gladly watch ads to be able to fill my energy. It would be nice to have a larger expansion area while needing the same requirements. Love the speciality collections!  Great job!",
        "In one of the recent updates, the timers to receive flowers messed up.  Purchased the passenger car and I'm on the fourth day so far. It counts down, but just before it finishes, another day is added.",

        "Warning! Once you start playing Angry Birds Match you'll never want to stop! I love this game. I have been looking for a game that isn't so easy I get bored or too hard I get angry! This game is perfect! The only thing I would like is could you possibly offer other ways to get more lives? Like watch a video to fill up ( like angry birds pop) or spin the wheel? I just hate waiting soooo long when I run out of lives, because I want to keep playing!!!!",
        "I've enjoyed this game, but I haven't been able to open it for several days. I hate to uninstall and lose all my progress. Any help would be appreciated. Ok, so after about a month of not loading it started working...for a month now it's down again. I upgraded today, 2/19, and still won't open, grrrr! Help!! Changed my 5 stars to 1! The game constantly freezes, closes and then won't reload. I've reinstalled 4 times and that's it I'm done. Really disappointing as when it runs it's so much fun.",
        "For some reason right in the middle of playing it has been quitting and then I lose that life. Very frustrating. Is there and update available?",
        "I love this game but for like 3 months since i updated I can't play and I just updated again and still the same doesn't let the game download it frozes, can you please fix that, or let me know what i can do, I dont want to uninstall it so I don't loose my progress.  Starting to get aggravated.  Thank you.",
        "I like this game a lot and would give higher reviews but a lot of times if I am playing a level and have one move left it ends the level and I never get to make the move. It's some kind of glitch in the game. I think it's trying to get me to buy gems and coins. Very frustrating and annoying.",
        "It seems to me that the objects to move are too small, it is always moving wrong way that I am trying to move. You should be able to select move by tapping, then swipe."

        "Awesome game. The only problem i have with it is the fact that my character is a level 20 and i still can't join a guild, which should be available at level 17.  Other then that it is just such a kick a$$ game i still have it all 5 stars."

        "The match making system could be improved. Match making is based on your level but does not take into account the level of the ship. To test this I took a Heavy Fighter At level 11 and was being matched up with Frigates. No chance in heck to win for me. Even at higher levels it's hard to win if your opponent has a ship 3-4 steps above you. A limit of 2 levels above and below for ships would be a good fix.",
        "A truly enjoyable game with a few simple strategies that somewhat take the fun away.   For instance, warp drives have a big chance of putting you behind the other guy where your thrusters and generators usually are(it's more or less game over if they get destroyed). If you go for a laser heavy they'll have no way of defending since they can't put armor and thrusters and shields don't block lasers.   Also you can't name your ship which is a bit of a missed opportunity",
        "I also liked the game more at lower levels. Maybe you could make it like a loss drops your rating by so many points. I hit lvl 130 and barely win a fight with either of the three of my ships. If we could drop points, maybe we could get 3 straight wins or 5 a day. The higher the rank, obviously means harder opponents. But my ships are only so strong while saving up money to by better upgrades or a better ship. Please fix this",
        "Great game, really fun gameplay. The feature of being able to earn up to ~50 celestium (in game paid currency) by playing the game and doing daily achievements is really good. Only gripe is that there is no confirmation button for spending celestium leading to accidently spending it at a miss-tap and no way to undo these purchases. Other than that very good.",
        "This game if fun....but after trying a couple of the free offers to gain in game currency and never receiving the funds I will be uninstalling. I contacted fyber(the ad company that gives out the currency) and they say they gave the compensation. I cannot support a game that blatantly states that funds may not be awarded and still uses the fraud company. It is a great disservice to the player base and I will not stand for it",
        "Fun concept and decently executed. So much so players don't see the pay to win till you get to level 10 ( the black market is locked till then). The items inside the black market take cash currency in large quantities. And even though you can earn the cash currency, the amount is petty and will take forever to stack up.  Though I can't see people popping in the large quantities of cash to be on top in this game, the possibility exists. Especially when most free to play games have players who are in house ( employees and other sources) and get damn near unlimited in game currency to force the public to invest into the game to compete for top ratings and bragging rights..."

It can't be that hard to get it back, I known a few ppl working in the gaming area, and they say it's pretty easy that you guys probably could care less, as long as you get your money...I really like playing it, I've put money into it, but security is horrible if I can have it connected to 3 things, yet someone can still steal it???.....Very disappointed now."

Love going back levels to see if i can get the feather.   Coin packages need to be more attractive if you want people to spend real money and tbe power up packages are way too expensive. Still....... i love the game",

        "Every time i reach a new level it says I have unlocked a table but when I go to place the table in the restaurant it hasn't been unlocked!!! Y'all ripping us off with these tables because it said unlocked at level 19 then I go to buy the table it say unlock at level 22 SMH I'm on level 20 & I only got 10 tables... won't be spending no more money on this game!",
        "I love this game. I've been playing for a while now but the price of stuff is too expensive. I just barely made the money to get the Hawaiian barman and now his price went  from 60,000 to 81,000. This is too much. Please drop the prices down.                  Edit: thank you for the updates. I started over but everything is much better priced I love it!",
        "What could have been really fun turned out to be quite frustrating. I love this game but due to your policy of not providing sufficient tools for expansion makes me giving it only one star. Indirectly forcing gamers to pay for stuffs sucks real big time. I hope you will bring some changes to make it playable again for the gamers who dont want to buy gems.",
        "Right now there's an annoying glitch that says I skipped the video even after watching it. I have to watch about 5-10 videos to get one that will give me the reward. Please fix!!",

        "I find it a little tricky to navigate sometimes, since it makes my on-screen navigation bar disappear. I like it but maybe I would like it more if there was a back arrow? Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",
        "Really disappointed. I played the party game to win the St Patrick's badge. I came 2nd place when it finished and ift said I had won a badge but it doesn't appear in my badge collection. Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. üòü",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",

My wife bought \"180\"  twice thinking she may have made a mistake the first time and only ended up with about 300 total. She already had quite a few to begin with. Ripoff!"

        "Good game  Except for the constant updates and also why when i use a breaker on someone(example i use laura shiba) and as she hits with her sword the strike move my opponent does still seems to overpower it..wheres the ethic in that? Lost many a battle due to this silly glitch..sort it out!! Once an attack has been made and is hitting the opponent regardless of priority moves it should still count!!",
        "Good graphics. I really wish you could sell rangers and monsters that you don't want. It is way too unorganized for me having all these warriors with flashing buttons saying UPGRADE, when I don't want to waste my coins and crystals on warriors I'm never gonna fight with.",
        "The controls are so bad and unresponsive that I routinely lose battles simply because it's not picking up my inputs. The gameplay is stupid from the fight mechanics to the stupid way you get characters. The game is made as a pay to win and that's just a terrible way to make a game. They keep saying performance enchanements in the updates and I'm just not seeing it. This game is purely a cash grab meant to take peoples money over nostalgia.",
        "Its to much of a gamble. For example i had a match were i started of with block, defense, block. And my opponent had from the looks a breaker, breaker, attack. I got freaking trashed in seconds. Thats the biggest issue for me and like some people leaders are f@#$*** ridiculously powerful. Needs more balance"

        "This game is awesome. The girls are beautiful and the songs are nice. There are a couple of errors I be having with the game though. I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won't get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved",
        "I like music game in general, it's hard to get the game right on mobile. but they manage to get it right here. The LP system prevent you to play continuesly unless you paid. But in my experience the amount is decent enough (this make you enjoy the music more since you dont have to restart to achieve perfection). The card mechanic is added bonus where you can spend hard earn cash. I can see people still enjoying the game without spending anything.",
        "Warning! This game is freakin' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging. The circle disappear sometimes during the live show. Sometimes the app even doesn't recognize my finger touch that makes me miss a circle. But overall. It's a good game  .... ALL HAIL PRINTEMPS AND GUILTY KISS",
        "I love the game definitely but with the new update, it keeps telling me that there's a transmission error then when it went through and finished connecting, it said that the data transfer was successful. I haven't transfered anything to a new device or anything like that. The only options I'm given is to contact support and start a new game in which I definitely don't want to do. It isn't my connection because everything else on my phone that requires WiFi is fine and I can use it. Is this because of the new update?",
        "I love the game and it's wonderful!!  But...  I had i don't know like a glitch or something.  When started to play the rhythm game while I playing suddenly the icon that I should press came faster all or a sudden. But the song is still OK.  After the glitch it becames back to normal.  This happen me for 3 times on the same day. Please fix it. And Thank you.",
        "It's so addicting and a fabulous rhythm game. One thing I'm really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don't do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don't know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls."

I tried to make it work for a day but it's super hard to earn money for upgrades. Even watching ads give so little rewards. Uninstalling. So unfortunate because i really loved the PC version of this.",
        "I gave Fish Tycoon 2 4 stars I have spent a lot of time playing this game, BUT, recently the daily rewards and rewards for task completion which include coins do not work.  You complete the task, you are told you are getting $200 added to you bank account, BUT your $ total does not change.  This makes it hard to get money to spend.  All you can do is breed and sell fish - which takes time.  I reported this and got a prompt response that they are sorry and that they were adding $ and Gems  to my account balances.  Nice, but my $ total did not change.  I did see an increase in my gems.  There is an update 2/21/18 hopefully this will improve some issues.",
        "This app is good but need high battery consumption. I hope new upcoming update can reduce battery consumption. For everyone who complaint about money, just relax, breed your discovered expensive fish first and sell it till you have sufficient money. If you have much money you can discover more species freely in order to find magic fish. It's not about speed but it's about passion, strategy, trial error and patient.",

This second release is better than the first, but it's still the same basic gameplay.  (tip: Don't buy uncommon eggs too early, or you'll be struggling with too many dying rare fish)"

        "Had fun with my brothers after a long time. The games are simple (like those old 8 bit games) and funny. More games are expected. Devs should consider implementing some of the open source free games to make it more engaging. The free version is heavily limited where you'll be locked out for 30 seconds and 5 minutes for every 5mins and 30 mins respectively. In addition, only 2 players can join in the free version. It should be atleast 3 people for a real multi-player (as against dual-player), with ad supported. Premium is very inexpensive, though.",
        "We just spent the last few hours playing these games as a family. It was so much fun.  The kids did not wanna stop playing.    Edit:  After a week or so we are still enjoying AirConsole. It can be hard to get three teenagers to sit and enjoy family time, but this works everytime.  I really recommend this one!",
        "Originally had it at 5 stars. Now has wayy to many ads. Every 30 min makes you take a 5 min break (unless you buy the premium version or whatever). It does have SOME fun games to play with friends....  But It now makes you buy the Super version to play with more than 2 people. So if you want to play with more that 1 friend you have to pay for it. Dont get it",
        "Amazing!!! Being able to play games  on the go is exactly what you need!! A nintendo switch is useless if you have this! Me and my cousins really enjoyed this. However, the only thing I would really want is to view the game on your phone or device instead of on a TV or other things as if everyone who is playing has a nintendo switch and can see their character or whatever on it.   Thanks for reading I hope my idea will be implemented",
        "This is easily the best console I've ever used. Even if you have a slow internet connection, it still works with almost NO latency. Even the 30 second downtime is good, because it let's you get a quick drink of water. This is my new favorite app.",
        "I would overall give this game 4 stars cause it is very fun and i hope that this app gets very popular. The only problem is that some of the games have swearing and i want to play this with my family. So please make a family friendly section. That is why i rated 4 stars"

        "Played this on PC, and really enjoyed it for its simple, quirky playstyle. While it does trail off at the end when you've mastered everything, the entertainment value is still strong. Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. üëçüëçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

        "Great for passing time, although at times you get kind of stuck where you can't gather any more materials because of storage capacity but then it takes forever to get the items for upgrade. The coin amount to buy some buildings is quite high on a lot of them, and the same with the trees and extra livestock. All in all I love playing this user friendly game!",
        "It has potential to be a great game. Its just so sloooow because you have to spend gems for almost everything. Its hard to get seeds because it's hard to get gems not everyone can afford to spend on these games. The land expansion sucks!!! It takes way to much, can't get what's needed half the time. Easier ways to get seeds and coins and it will be better.... Thanks!",
        "I enjoy this game. It's very addictive but in a good way. I actually just got my wife hooked on playing it as well.   My one question though, why are there so many differences between the Android system version and the IPhone system  version? On each building, my wife can see each item available and what level is needed to unlock it. That doesn't show on mine. Also, on hers, she has a fair/bazaar looking building, a delivery truck, and a hot air balloon thing.  Why are these not on the android version????",
        "Good game,  potential to be great I enjoy most of this game. To make it even better - more tools or the ability to buy them,  I have land I can't use because I can't clear it.  The ability to move trees,  grass, rocks until we are able to clear them, so we can make better use of our land. Better rewards  for completing collections,  I've gotten coins and 1 or 2 shovels.  Not good considering how long it takes to complete & that it says win up to 10 tools!?!  Better fishing,  I only catch catfish,  bass,  and anchovies.",
        "Half my images are invisible. I can't see half of my buildings or the items to craft, crafted items, items on sale or even my stand. I submitted a report to Storm 8 only to be told in a automated reply that they don't have the staff to handle it and there was nothing that would be done. I loved this game and had recently started over, looking forward to playing. Now, once I hit lvl 8, I'm uninstalling.",
        "Farm story 2 This game could be used and enjoyed more but at this time I am not playing as it is more frustrating them fun.  I need to expand the barn and silo but the things needed are a large amounts and RARE to achieve or even buy in the market.  Frustrated with trying to upgrade my barn so I will be taking a break for a while and will see if I return"

        "I think this app needs to be redesigned as a stand alone non-MMORPG that does not require any form of Sociopathetic Media. Cute design concept. Interesting plot. Clever programming. But I despise anything remotely like Social Media Community gatherings. If people want to meet get outside and go somewhere. The library, park, museum, etc.",
        "I usually download games and get rid of them because they aren't as good as they are made out to be. Also I get bored fast with games. Shards of Magic has been really fun and I play it often everyday when I have time! Nice to have a game that I don't get bored with. Oh! and you can buy gems, however, its easy to accumulate gems just playing! Have fun!",
        "Been a fan since Crystal Saga. Played Wartune when it first came out and participated in the open beta of Dragon pals. Played Crystal Saga 2, am lvl 82 on S1. Now I'm trying your mobile games. Keep up the good work, coming from one of your fans!",
        "Was a great game. But the pay to win has been pushed way way too far. The only way to play competitive anymore is to spend.. and spend big. I have always been happy to buy vip.. but the amounts of money you have to drop now to remain competitive is outrageous. Thanks for killing my favorite mobile app with greed r2.",
        "Game is buggy, you email support... bugs never get fixed.  They run gem promotions to give 30% bonus and it doesnt give any... fraudulent imo.  Dont waste your time.",
        "It's another one of those games that cranks numbers up so high to make us feel special. It's like seeing an item for 4.99. Wowee, it's less than 5! Play summoners war instead. Same concept, less pandering to fragile egos."

        "A great game with unique map designs and user friendly controls, free to play if you have patience and play strategically, pay to win if you want to advance faster. It is especially a good game for busy people like me who can only spend 10-15 minutes per day but need to stay in the game for a large number of days to be competitive. Don't try to use items and gems on every maps, it is fun and challenging to clear them without shortcuts. *Tip for developers*: Instead of giving purchase options for Sethos and Phoenix they could go with Yan and Narlax, gives chance for new players to compete also developers can milk in additional purchases.",
        "Great TD game with decent difficulty and NPCs progression while still maintining a pattern making you work to figure out various strategies.  Ads have never been an issue I honestly cant remember where they are.  I think they may only be for like \"double your rewards for battle\" kind of thing.  90% (A) or better in my oppinion.  Mainly cause I want to see more progression.  Note I am only a few levels in so I dont know if theres a pay to get by an immpassable place yet.",

I am at level 90+ and found the first 3 worlds great fun and balanced but now you have effectively destroyed the enjoyment factor by making the enemies SO strong that you cannot possibly beat them unless you have max level heroes...and the best max level heroes require so much to level up that without paying an absurd amount of real money you may aswell give up.you have broken what could have been the best game on android with selfish Pay 2 win tactics .

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

It's never other ways to get strawberries u have to buy the coin alot in order to get most things which wldnt be a big deal if u wld make things more practical like the time it takes to make food an grow fruit especially the strawberries. Two many ppl order stuff requiring strawberries so they sitting there 2 an 3 days for there order wld not happen in real life. Fix the time it takes to cook an grow food.",

REPLY 3-2-2018 The afore mentioned games don't have any ads (except watch a video). Therefore they are way better in that aspect alone. Get rid of the ads and I'll give more stars. A \"classy 5 star restaurant\" doesn't need ads. So that makes me think this game has NO class or programmers are greedy or both. REPLY 3-5-2018 I did contact in game support and they basically  said: \"So sad, to bad, we don't care.\" So again that makes me think the makers of this piece of trash are just  a bunch of greedy people.

NO WAY AM I SPENDING ON MICRO TRANSACTIONS UNTIL YOU FIX THIS!!!  TRY ADDING A GRAPHICS DOWNGRADE OPTION, OR BETTER STILL, DO THE F**KING JOB RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!",
        "have used bejewelled for so many years.. I don't understand why you have changed the app. it's terrible. The game is no fun anymore. It didn't need changing. After all these years! I am now deleting the app. Goodbye Bejewelled. it was fun while it lasted and before it was ruined",
        "Before the massive revamp on the visuals I thoroughly enjoyed the game and played it quite a lot. Although after this gargantuan update it seems to be really laggy and I experience frame rate issues almost all the time making enjoyable and smooth gameplay impossible. This is especially annoying since I am playing on an s8 +",
        "Please make this play like it does on the iPad with the same size screen ad my s2 tab  the games not in full screen and it's so frustrating when you have spent all that money on a tablet and it's not supported these same! Really annoying",
        "Power up item is a must to achieve high score yet its hard to get enough coin to afford one. The score u got when not using compared to using power up kinda 1:10. Not recommend, play the regular version instead.",
        "Rips you off where's my money for going on Facebook and how does this work out how many coins you get per game..... Pretty sucky!  So take me off Facebook  it takes ages to build up any money and the extra ones are so expensive.!!!"

        "Awesome game if u love strategy & buissness tactics with football......plz upgrade the game play in exhibition or others game play into 3d & give a weekly basis youth squad facility....fans need it...& love it",
        "Surprisingly deep experience. I suppose the obvious comparison would be to Soccer Spirits. This is a lot more grounded in reality (there's a lot less talking rabbits and little girls who can do magic), but there's more to do. There's also a dry cleverness permeating everything.  UPDATE: I've hit a weird and frustrating wall--the game isn't clear about when its days roll over. I guess it might be UTC (there are several indications that the game originates in the UK), but for a few days, my daily quests were rolling over at midnight Pacific Time (like most of these games that punish players for not playing every day), but today I noticed that there doesn't seem to be ANY consistency regarding when daily quests begin and end. Anyway, I'm docking two stars (I otherwise believe that this is a five-star game) until the game's daily rollover time is clarified. I had a nice streak going, that the game's failure to communicate ruined.",

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Great game thanks. as smooth as we like it well-done. To google players if you are  looking for action GTA 5 style then this is the game for you. I can't wait to get home from work every night make a brew and chill on this till I run out of battery lol class A game. (Again thank you for making this game) can't wait for updates fingers crossed",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks"

        "I had the original game fairway  solitaire  on my iPad i tried to download that one but it said that it wasn't compatible to my phone. So I downloaded this one at first I didn't like it little confusing but now I love it the only thing that I recommended being able to find out what is power of means at any given time meaning I can go back days from now to find out what that power up mean otherwise I would recommend this game to anyone",
        "I hate games that say. Free. Then to advance you mustI pay  Or log into Fb.  I would just log on and find games, so far I can advance without paying maybe watch an ad. I have a similar game and you just watch ads for coins. If u like paying, then this is a good one. You can play once in a while. I guess. Good game. I would pay for the game itself, but not for a level. Make a pay game then allow a choice. FB making money. Iove it nonetheless. I play on, and it has gotten better.ü§ó",
        "Great game enjoyed on iPad.  Glad you made it for Android.  Would give all Stars if only for one glitch so far! Can't change profile picture or display name gives error code invalid username.  Wish it would be able to remember my level and placement weather I'm using WiFi or not! right now if WiFi not turned on it woodcut give current stats.  Please fix!",
        "Love this game. Challenging but also a lot of fun. This h as become one of my favorite games. What I really am getting hooked on are the daily challenges. The boosters are the \"bomb\"! This has become my go to game. And I will  add harder as you  progress. Still hooked! Level 234 and still can't get enough! I love it but it's getting really difficult. But still hooked! Still playing. Love the tourneys! Now at level 370 plus and still going!!",
        "Very addictive & fun. I've been playing for about 3 months & having fun with it.  It's so addicting, I don't even want to put the phone down. **Well, I'm still playing, even though I did take about a 3 month break from the game, but I missed playing it...so here I am. You know, you just need a break every once-in-a-while. I'm rambling now, but all-in-all this app is a great way to pass the time & have fun while you're doing it.",
        "Fun Fun & More Fun...Great  Game  Learning more about the game daily. In addition it makes playing solitaire totally exciting. Very Unique & Fun Game & Good  Way To Pass Away Time. I Love This Game So Much I Play It Daily.Just Love This Game! The only complaint is that I don't always receive my bonus points wish I could get Them"

        "Where's the 720 potbucks?!  Liars.  Pot farm brought me here.  Need more sexy babes.  A first person shooter mode too, like halo 1 online. Just nother point n click, like bleach online mmorpg.  The game that has all sexy babes no dudes, and the chicks beat dudes and practice femdom, we probably get the highest ratings and be the most popular lol.",
        "This is not the game i watched a video for. I would like to play that game (if it exists) but the link brought me this steamer. I'm sure your well aware of this as you've had plenty of reviews saying as much so its obvious to me you dont care. Great way to build a loyal customer base",
        "The game was fun for a little while, but it becomes quite monotonous. The game isn't interactive enough to keep you coming back for more. You more or less just watch your heroes battle which takes a lot of possible fun out of the game right away. If you spend any cash at all on the game, you unlock the ability to \"raid\" your already completed missions. So then when you need items, you will just mash the raid button until your energy is gone. And the energy recharges VERY slowly. You can play for free, but will progress substantially slower than the pay-to-play player. So overall, it's fun for a short while (a week or two), but you will quickly grow tired of it due to poor interactivity. If you are looking for a game similar to this that will keep your interest and has much more to offer, I would recommend Summoners War.",
        "Game apparently 'malfunctioned' and the heroic chest kept saying open free.  This was after I spent $25 US dollars so of course I thought why wouldn't I get some free opens?  I didn't know they were charging me 200 emeralds a pop.  Customer service was NO help.  Hopefully I can get a refund from Google Play.  Don't download!  Bad programming, scam in game purchases!",
        "While the game seems nice enough, it is nothing like the advertisement I watched. Complete misrepresentation gets one star."

        "Was more enjoyable to play before the update. Before I could move items I bought now everything I buy ends up in upper left corner. Cannot really even see each item. I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "Only wasted my time for a few levels then got rid of this pretty quick! Why waste your time completing levels, earning coins to buy stuff to decorate  when whatever you buy just gets a ll plopped down in one spot and cannot be moved. That's NOT decorating!!!! Fix that and I may be back.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average.",
        "This game bites. In the middle of game it freezes up or just returns to the start screen,if you can't fix this problem I'm uninstalling."

And when i do have hero's  in the adventure mode it cuts to them when I pick the time challenges.  Please fix this.  And also happy anniversary üòÄ   Problem was fixed thank you very much!üòä",

I really do appreciate how much of a back seat it it feels like the adds are taking to gameplay.",

I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this genre!",

I watched almost any that were presented to me in order to get farther faster but now they literally always load up a few seconds, then the game like restarts and I get jack from it. Dudes!

        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."

        "Brings Back Fond Memories I love this game! I spent countless hours playing this in the early 2000s. The controls are easy enough to understand and the text is legible on my LG V10. I don't if I'd be able to read it on a smaller screen, they are not kidding when they say this is meant for tablets. If you've got a tablet or phablet I can't recommend this game enough.",
        "A classic perfectly adapted to the phone platform This game is a MUST-have for any rpg lover. The D&D mechanics may seem i bit weird in the beginning, but you will learn in time. The replayability value of this game is almost infinite. Personally I have never played any kind of game that would allow me to play as many hours in so many different ways. The game excels in its easy to handle mechanics, fun dialogue, compelling story, great ammount of side-quests that are actually enjoyable. Hands down best Apk for this platform. Worth every penny.",
        "Great Classic CRPG BGII was definitely a breakthrough in its time, but it still holds charm and depth that many newer games can't even touch. I have this game for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and I can tell the chip set on the phone is grinding gears with the games engine. It's playable but only when the right character menu is minimized but it still gets choppy when multiple spells are being  cast. With the specs on the s7 this shouldn't be the case. Hey Developers any input/ advice on how to solve this issue?",
        "Amazing! There's a lot to love.  First, if you played the original, this is just as good with extras.  Granted, it's a bit harder to see everything, but it's what happens when you take a computer game and make it available for a phone.  Beamdog has brought additional characters, adventures, magic items, portraits and voices to the game to expand the character creation.  Some expansions are dull (like the arena unless you love grinding) but more of this rpg is on the way.  It's truly the best classic game reborn.",
        "I have a special request. I have purchased very possible version of the bg series, and have played as long as the game has existed. Call me a war vet asking for a wheel chair ramp but could you guys implement the imput of  points or the option to roll. 20+ years of rolling for stats has earnt me the option. Other than that perfect game, worth every licence for every platform. Either let us input stats with option to roll or make a shadowkeeper for android please.",
        "Game is great, as I've played it on another device. However on Note 8 it does not take up the whole screen, and the usable screen is significantly smaller than on s7 edge, and is barely playable. When I force it to full screen in settings, then touching on sides of screen are not recorded accurately. For example, when I try to resize the text box, it toggles AI instead. Makes the game virtually unpayable."

        "not sure about the rating questions. Complex as in difficult? No. complex in features, absolutely. simple as in boring? heck no. but easy to learn and play. very straight forward and relaxing which is what i look for in a game. graphics are stellar. game advances relatively quickly. have seen no glitches or issues so far. i'm only at level 2 or 3 so can't say how difficult it will be over time. if you like hidden objects games, you should like this one.",
        "Could not possibly be more of a money grab. There are about four different internal payment systems, but no interchange between them. You can get more by paying CASH MONEY NOW or by waiting until enough time has elapsed for some of them to have increased. If you're looking for something you can play for more than 15 mins, forget it. If you've run out of time in the crystal matching game, you can watch ad's to get bonus time - except when this crashes, so it loses your progress and the cost to get into that level. And then there's the assignments which appear on your list, but aren't available to you until you've gone up three more levels. Utterly pointless and incredibly frustrating.",
        "This is a really good game but I have to agree with other players that the game crashes a heck if a lot and you will find that you pay for items that you never receive. I have contacted them on two occasions about this and fair to say it was sorted. However the last time this happened (about a week ago) I tried to report it but it would not allow me to submit my complaint. Players beware."

        "I'm so addicted to this game! Out of all the simulation games I've played this is by far my favourite. The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don't have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it's worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.",
        "I LOVE this game, and everything about it is awesome, aside from the fact that I just got a new phone and now the time is correct on it (my old phone clock was an hour off), and daylight savings time just happened so while my new phone time is an hour later, my game won't let me play due to the time change. It says I need to go back to my previous time zone (which I haven't moved anywhere, its just daylight savings time). I've already put a suggestion up on your site asking about whether you guys can put an option to change the time on the game for these very situations, or to install a daylight savings time option so it can keep up with real time. Other than that though, I absolutely love the game, the graphics, the game play, and the characters to which I get so attached to, are stunning and beautiful. Y'all should be really proud of yourselves &lt;3",
        "Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it's a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won't be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)",
        "Loved it overall but make the chats last longer without having to reset them as I miss them with school or sleep. Not everyone can use the app at certain times in the day. It doesn't have to last the whole day just a few more hours  or 10. The games good other than that though. It's a good way to pass the time and has a good story.Keep up the good work.",
        "Im in love wih the characters already! Though, its kinda sad that you are forced to be a girl character even if you state that you arent in game. That kinda took me out of the experience a bit. I understand it would probably take a lot of effort to put that option in, but man would it be cool. Keep up the great work!",
        "I've been a long term fan now since 2016 when it came out and I still play it to this day! The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to! I have been in love with Saeran since the Common Route so him getting his own route was like a dream come true! Although, his route is an emotional roller coaster.."

        "Surprisingly deep experience. I suppose the obvious comparison would be to Soccer Spirits. This is a lot more grounded in reality (there's a lot less talking rabbits and little girls who can do magic), but there's more to do. There's also a dry cleverness permeating everything.  UPDATE: I've hit a weird and frustrating wall--the game isn't clear about when its days roll over. I guess it might be UTC (there are several indications that the game originates in the UK), but for a few days, my daily quests were rolling over at midnight Pacific Time (like most of these games that punish players for not playing every day), but today I noticed that there doesn't seem to be ANY consistency regarding when daily quests begin and end. Anyway, I'm docking two stars (I otherwise believe that this is a five-star game) until the game's daily rollover time is clarified. I had a nice streak going, that the game's failure to communicate ruined.",

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "Saw in Facebook and thought I would give it a try. I am now addicted. I love how realistic they make the interaction seem. The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more \"proving innocence\" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn't not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend",
        "I really like this game!  The game feels so real. The text messages you send out and get are from your actual time! Oh to make the game more interesting...you go to the dial tone dial 893702 the erase it don't hit call. At the bottom it will say chat, settings, etc. Click on those then go back to dial tone and repeat. This will give you more \"money\" to buy more lives and stuff. This really helps make the game more interesting! I am currently addicted :)",
        "I've been playing this game off and on for ages, I love the storyline to it and the interaction with the other characters - the only thing to make that better would be if we could submit our own responses rather than the two choices given. The puzzles I like, but it would be interesting to have different types of puzzles rather than the same one repeatedly.  Got to the witness protection part of the game and it has frozen on me. I have collected all stars but no interaction is coming up on the text screen so not sure what to do next!!",
        "I left a negative review at first before uninstalling it. After a few days or so, I deleted the review and decided to give it another chance and installed it again. So glad that I did! Now I love this game. I find it interesting with the storyline as well as the puzzles. It does leave me curious about how I'd react or what I'd say if it was real instead of a game. I was hoping to get it on another device, but this game isn't compatible with it. Thank you for this game! I ended up having to start the game all over again since I had to factory reset my phone, so this is 2 reviews in one. I love this game and it's very addicting to me since I'm addicted to it. Even after I get all the goals completed with the puzzles, I still want to continue. Love the storyline since it keeps my interest. Thank you for creating this game for all of us to continue to play and enjoy.",
        "This game is great. It's my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It's so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.",
        "I absolutely love this game but I had something glitch to where I have all my messages but the block buster game said I've only completed the first set of puzzles when I was actually on probably the sixth or seventh. I tried playing along thinking it has to do with someone hacking my messages in the game but to no avail. I'm considering uninstalling and reinstalling I just don't want to go that far back and have to start over with how slow it is to progress. Please help!"

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",

The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",

        "Literally unplayable. Game pauses itself in the middle of races multiple times. I am nowhere near touching the paise button and even went as far as to place my phone on the ground and touch the phone with only one finger on the accelerate button. SOMEHOW the game pauses itself 7 times during that race. Uninstalling.",
        "It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could \"ditch the glitch\" so to speak. Thanks",
        "So hard to beat the game. I'm not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can't buy anything in shop without real money.",
        "Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win",
        "Been playing for a few years and about to quit because every time I have a lead my bike goes forward by itself and starts glitching. Almost feels like I'm being cheated out of a good run. Maybe it's because I don't pay to play. Please fix or I'm deleting!",
        "The one thing that wrecks the game for me is the little hangup glitches that happen constantly.  You need to be precise to win races, and it's pretty hard to do that when the game is always stuttering.  Running on a brand new MotoZ2 Play, btw."

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "Played this on PC, and really enjoyed it for its simple, quirky playstyle. While it does trail off at the end when you've mastered everything, the entertainment value is still strong. Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "It's an OK game with pretty complex party building mechanics. But, it also has terrible progression that almost pushes you to spend cash if you're not patient.    And the controls...  For a mobile game, the controls is not very responsive, sometimes I decided to drag a character to attack and the game decided to instead move the character forward and switches with the front unit, in a game where formation matters, this breaks the whole system, and so in order to prevent that, you'll have to drag it slowly, so it registers properly   The hit box is also pretty terrible, sometimes I decided to attack but then it didn't register because I didn't hit the right hit box.   Overall the game itself is not bad, but it has slow progression and getting the 5* (which is very necessary especially the raid class item) is very hard, definitely play this game if you are a very patient person.",
        "Problems solved. Thank you",
        "I give this a 5. I'm F2P and the ??",
        "It's can be fun game(for a short)if you are not interested in the competitive aspect. If you want to be competitive you gotta spend a lot of real money because of prestige.Prestige xa give you additionnal stats to your unit.  You need to spend more than 800$ to have every stats bonus only avaible with prestige. You can gain a few prestige every year but they increase the prestige cap faster.  Pvp is boring, from bronze to silver all i had to do is put a tank on capture point to win. And now i have been losing 95% of all of my matches in gold( and i cant fall back i silver even if i only losses)  Guild arent interesting if you arent super powerfull as you do 0.1% of what a big player does.  It takes a long time to even be somewhat strong.  Pve is ok but really short if its the only thing you do.",
        "This game can be spendy but even without buying anything, you can still advance quickly. There are known bugs but it is address very quickly. I definitely enjoy the gameplay and involvement of the whole community to grow your team.",
        "Normally, I don't give freemium pay to win games 5 stars, but this one is different. Basically all the money options are crazily overpriced, but if you put the time in they give you tons of premium currency just for playing. I've been playing for awhile and it hasn't slowed down yet. I just wish they had a decently priced option because I'd like to support the developers, but there isn't really a good option, monetarily, to do that. Everything cheap is lackluster and anything worthwhile is expensive.    If you like tactics games this game can definitely holds your attention for awhile."

It was getting tiresome going down to mine, a cave somewhere in the middle to find to restart a mission, then back to the top to smelt/craft. Then you have the auto mining platforms that are movable but one wrong touch and it resets.   Graphics were great.  There are other game like this, that don't spam ads during nongame play, that are equal or better",
        "Hey wonderful game! Except that I might have broken it...killed the Amber Elder before crafting tesla coil.",

Works fine after, but getting tiresome. As is the really pointless nuclear reactor that takes months to fuel for one short run. Weapon upgrades now stupid requirements - latest needs more obsidian than I've mined in over a year.... Get a grip on reality people!",

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

        "Finally a mobile mmo that actually feels like a real mmorpg. Nice graphics, skills, open world questing, lots of players. Fights are engaging  and boss fights are spectacular and interactive. You do need a team for dungeons and raids as you can't just 1 shot everything, like in other mobile mmos. I've tried loads but this is the best by far! Keep it up!",
        "Man, this is a perfect 5/7! Out of a crapton of Mu Origin game clones, this is even better than original! Polished graphics, nice player skills set, awesome UI items layout - everything is top notch! The only thing I can wish for is adding camera turn on top of player strafe via joystick. Thanks for the hard work, and please keep it up!",
        "Great mobile MMO! Good graphics and narration so the story stays interesting. Additionally...SO much Co-op and PvP and a lot of things to give an edge. Not P2P dominated either so far. Obviously the grind to 55 is tough but I have a few characters on different servers there still very possible.",
        "I think this game is amazing for an MMO mobile. It has a feeling of blade and soul and WOW and the graphics sre amazing on my Razer phone! Actually feels like a real MMO, and I like that there are character voices.  Only problem I am having is whenever I go to turn the Volume up or down all sound cuts out and won't come back on until i restart the game. So I need to pre-set my volume before launching the game and then not touch the volume while playing.",
        "I'm furious.  First you guys fix the Android problem. Now I run thru the update and a screen pops up that I need to relaunch game because it's out of date. How when I literally JUST watched it update? I've spent a lot of time on this game and really like it but if I can't even get to the character select screen, why would I keep it on my phone. It's a shame, it really is.",
        "Could not even start playing. At the start screen the audio is pushing and choppy. This persisted into the game itself, turning off the music did not help, though turning off all sound did. Not playing this type of game without sound. I have a Note 8, so a top of the pine phone, so it's not me running  a phone that can't handle this type of game"

The worst is even if I change the interface to left handed before a dual the game automatically changed the interface to right hand. And after a dual starts there is no way to access the setting to change to left hand. Please fix it! It's like forcing a left handed person to write with his right hand. I don't play duals anymore because of this problem. And I know if I don't play duals I won't get anywhere in this game. Be considerate please and fix it",

For starters, when I'm in the middle of a duel, it will straight up just kick me off and it will exit the game completely...its very frustrating. Second, why when someone is doing the duel, the opponent gets an extra 20 seconds to complete it?? I have won so many duels but since they get an extra 20 seconds, they tend to beat me when clearly I was ahead when the duel was actually over...please fix this. I really do love this game but it needs debugged to be a badass game.",

        "I'm a big mahjong player and this game is like mahjong on crack. i definitely recommend it to my fellow mahjong nerds. it's awesome with how many levels there are and boosters and achievements and the whole shebang. not just a regular mahjong game where you can only play the game and nothing more. if you like the whole saving up crystals and buying boosters and earning achievements jawn, then you'll love this game. side note, I also have not spent real life money on this game mostly because I don't need to. I usually will buy stuff for games only because I use the money I get from my Google rewards app cause that money goes straight into my Google play account. so it's not that I'm anti spending money on games, but I haven't yet felt like I needed to. it's not one of those where you need to spend money to have it be fun at all (well, not yet anyway! hopefully that won't change) or to be able to get past a certain point. so I totally recommend this to all my mahjong nerd brothers and sisters!",
        "It is a shame that this game allows one to start a new mod and a day or two later sends the player back to the original mod to collect hats, lanterns or eggs. A more polite end to an uncompleted game would be \"Try Again!\" rather than \"You lose!\" This the most rude end that I have seen on any of these games.",
        "So far its good! Just wish you would not link all your games like you do it bogs the games down. And wish you would fix it so that if you had a game several years ago in which you used your email address you could reuse it even if you can't remember your password",
        "A different spin on the classic MahJong game. It's fast-paced  and sometimes it doesn't respond as quick as I  would like. I wish the game would allow just a little more time because it is difficult to see the different levels to find all the matching tiles.",
        "I love this game. However I do have problems with the loading. It says there is no internet connection which is not true. I have fast ADSL and it is connected all the time. Why don't I have problems with other games then? They all work perfectly. Please look into this matter. Thanking you.",
        "I paid 1.99 for 40 eggs and game earned the other 5... and the \"unique prize\" was 5 gems.... I would think it would be something a little more...idk just more. Other than that, the game is awesome. Love the whole idea. Levels, like any other of the \"saga\" games with mahjong."

        "An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It's so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I'm sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/",
        "Elder scrolls legends is a game with a elder scrolls taste and mechanics. Its choices, game modes and progress systems works perfect. It's story is great, and serve as a tutorial for the big part of the game. You can even unlock new dlc and decks through your progress in the game. This is truly a marvelous game. Problems like connection break occurs very rare and does not affect the game. If you like CCG and ELDER SCROLLS, then this game is highly recommended.",
        "Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it's very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done üëç",
        "The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn't know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on \"draft\" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they're putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.",
        "Week 1: *Going to try to make this an ongoing review*. Had to lower this to 4 stars overall, because you have to either pay or grind to access all of story mode. I'm gonna buy it, but I think it shouldn't cost more than $14.99. Just mho. PvP is fun and you actually play LIVE people, not an AI running someone's cards. Level rewards seem generous and worthwhile.  Runs a bit slow, but I know it's my phone and not the app's fault. Gameplay is very fluid and makes sense. I already like it FAR BETTER than Hearthstone.",
        "Fun game! Is very generous with card packs and rewards. Plenty of deck complexity yet easy to get into. The RnG can be troublesome at times, but I guess that's just how card games go. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy card games, specially if you're and Elder Scrolls fan."

        "I've tried many TD so far still playing this one..every level in every map is unique..  its cool how I can pick and lvl Heroes but then it takes awhile to add a new one when running out of gems (since gems are needed for Heroes) unless u pay to keep playing or just to wait for tournaments... it takes patience lol but I don't mind playing again",
        "A great game with unique map designs and user friendly controls, free to play if you have patience and play strategically, pay to win if you want to advance faster. It is especially a good game for busy people like me who can only spend 10-15 minutes per day but need to stay in the game for a large number of days to be competitive. Don't try to use items and gems on every maps, it is fun and challenging to clear them without shortcuts. *Tip for developers*: Instead of giving purchase options for Sethos and Phoenix they could go with Yan and Narlax, gives chance for new players to compete also developers can milk in additional purchases.",
        "Great TD game with decent difficulty and NPCs progression while still maintining a pattern making you work to figure out various strategies.  Ads have never been an issue I honestly cant remember where they are.  I think they may only be for like \"double your rewards for battle\" kind of thing.  90% (A) or better in my oppinion.  Mainly cause I want to see more progression.  Note I am only a few levels in so I dont know if theres a pay to get by an immpassable place yet.",
        "*Updated* SCAM! Games slowly bleeds away your gems without mechanics being apparent. (I lost 300 gems in the last 3 days) Good luck unlocking heroes or content without paying $30-40. -2 stars.",
        "Your game is WAY too hard. I am at level 90+ and found the first 3 worlds great fun and balanced but now you have effectively destroyed the enjoyment factor by making the enemies SO strong that you cannot possibly beat them unless you have max level heroes...and the best max level heroes require so much to level up that without paying an absurd amount of real money you may aswell give up.you have broken what could have been the best game on android with selfish Pay 2 win tactics . Uninstalling after months of enjoyment and gameplay.  You need to fix this and make it challenging but not impossible",
        "It's really addicting, a lot of challenges and puzzles for the towers... really loved it! Good job team!   A bit of improvement: maybe an easier way to access the other worlds would be really good!?"

No help, and no fun if you enjoy the leveling up your character part. Basically if you want to watch your character bounce around and  not know what's going on then this games for you. To be fair, guess you would pick it up sooner or later ; (",

        "This auto complete thing can be good, but I don't like how it does everything for you. You don't even play the game, it plays itself and has zero explanation of what to do, just pulls you into different directions. Sorry, if I want to play a game, I ACTUALLY WANT TO PLAY IT!!!",

        "This is more of a bug report. The game doesn't show the trail of levels, from the main menu straight to asking to play the next level.  I tried to uninstall and reinstall the app and the issue continues to persist.  Other than that the game is great.",
        "I really enjoy the King games. However, on this particular game, I cannot change the avatar like I can on your other games. When I submitted this the submit option did not work. I am not on Facebook. I am signed in by email. If I could get this fixed,  it would be 5 stars.",
        "Like most King games sometimes you might think its rigged when you can't pass a level but you get within one shot of passing every time, very frustrating! Other than that it's great to have a different match 3 game that challenges and forces me to think through every move. If played for extended period it can be a bit hard going back to a typical match 3 game (like Candy Crush) when you forget to stop sliding!",
        "Addictive and cute! At first glance, I thought it looked childish but after playing it a few days, I love it! Keep up the good work! ‚ù§",
        "Updated 2/2018- well at least we can sorta replay old levels but wouldn't it have just been easier to let us pick which levels we want to replay instead whatever this randomizer thing is doing. This game is infuriating but I can't quit it. At least I have the sense to never spend money on it since there's no advancement.    (old review) You have to let us go back and play old levels. It's really annoying on games where I choose to actually spend extra money, when updates change things like this."

Gee, thanks for the 50 coins every 24 hours!",

        "I have not paid a cent for this game, and have never felt forced to. With gradually increasing difficulty levels, the game is never too hard nor too easy. I love the combo of a CCG and a match three that this game has been able to do extremely well.  Not only is the game fun to play but the soundtrack is beautifully composed and the graphics are gorgeously rendered.  If you only want one game on your phone then let it be this one, you will not be dissapointed.",
        "Awesome! This is a great way to entertain the brain! My favorite part is honestly the minigame treasure hunt. So fun!!! Sadly you dont get to play it without Glory.... I don't even care about PvP, but apparently that's the only real option I have to earn Glory and play the minigame... Wish we could get the treasure maps with other in game resources... Or make a second app just for the minigames because theyre super fun...",
        "This game gets better and better with each update. Superb graphics, thousands of possibilities of creating your own unique army, mini-games, guilds... and all of those for free (you don't have to spend a single coin and still be a really strong player). Recommended!   PS. This game is so addictive that should be illegal ;-)",
        "Game is an addictive grind fest! You're always making progress, finding new cards, heading towards guild goals, etc. You can have tons of fun for free, but beware - recent updates are more gem-hungry than ever before. Gems can be earned for free, but not at the rate the game wants you to spend them. Don't feel you have to.",
        "This game sucks! The matching is SOOOO predictable. It goes like this: You move once maybe twice then the cpu goes and guess what. They get like 7-8 moves in a row. Combo after combo EVERYTIME the cpu moves. You don't get the gems you need either. I love jewel games and jewel quest but this game is not the same. Only in appearance maybe. So disappointed. Looks fun. Thought I'd have fun. But it straight up isn't.",
        "Great game that doesn't make u wait for resources to replenish and so far I don't feel like it's pay to win. There's lots to grind for here in a good way. I recommend it. All it needs is some form of instruction. I haven't been able to figure out how the boosts add up. It's been a lot of trial and error."

My last login. I immediately had a tutorial telling me to add my healer to the squad. Which was already added. So, the tutorial forced me to remove her.

        "Easy to pick up and varied game play.  Some of the controls can be a little repetitive but not to the point of distraction.  Keeps you interested and doesn't require a great expenditure of cash if you are a relatively casual player.  Plenty of good themed events.  All in all a good distraction which I have now been playing for almost a year !",
        "I have been enjoying this game very much since I installed it maybe about a month ago. I actually stopped participating in a game that I've been in for 3 years for I find the is more entertaining, better graphics, quick response time on tickets and the community is more open. Highly recommend this game; which I might add is for all ages and gender who enjoy space battles and strategy. Thanks eh",
        "Love this game. it would be nice to know what kind of equipment you are going up against in war like you see when you are in pursuit mode i.e. DT, CR, MS, BS and what kind of weapons and defense. Thanks for the great game",
        "Great game with a large degree of strategy. Unfortunately, recent changes make it very difficult to obtain good heroes without P2P. This is most likely going to erode the free to play player base resulting in a game that is not as fun to play. Hopefully this can be rectified in future updates.",
        "Ooh dear ooh dear how sad,, yes that directed to you again astro-(I've run out of ideas an getting desperate now)-nest.  Just had a login gift (cue fanfare) which was 2 pointless training id's.. Big bloody Whoop. Oh an let's not forget the equally pointless (get your hands in your pockets/debit/credit card rip-off) St Patricks day event. Cue no crystal/AP boosters.. Seriously you jokers should all have stripey shirts on with a little printed card with numbers on attached.. What's truly sad is the games good, possibly even great.. But! Greed as always outweighs the gamers creed.. FYI! I don't expect a reply.. Your preprogrammed bots don't know how to deal with genuine critism, nor do you care either",
        "A very amusing game. It has its flaws, but so do you! :-)  At least give it a try, you won't be dissapointed."

        "Could you increase the amount of experience amd coins gained for the special events and the quests? Its kind of pathetic to just gain 2 coins and like 3 exp after a rough match. Edit: 17/3/18 The app doesnt respond to my selections. It is working fine, but when I wanted to open my booster, I kept tapping on the screen and nothing happens? It just kept loading and loading.",
        "A Big Thank You to the developers, they really listen to their fan base and fix bugs Immediately. This game is So good, as well as unique. No Ads. Doesnt bother to ask you to Rate. Doesnt bother you to Buy Currency. It made me wanna buy a small portion strictly out of appreciation. Mad Respect. If your reading this, download this right now, you WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED! If so, just delete it. ;)",
        "The only thing that I have is a good day. I am a beautiful person. I will not be able to understand the importance of the map. I am a beautiful person. I will not be able to understand that it was not able, I will have a lot more to do. it will take you about it and the other side, but it is the first to review and update you. the first to review and update you. the only one who has a lot. I'm not a good idea. the only one who has a lot. I'm not a good idea to have a great day. I am a beautiful person. I will not be able to make sure that you can also be used to be Demon the f the last knight trailer super bowl party in the world of difference between the hours of the cybermen the wheel of a new one. it will make it. the first to 908",
        "Only issue latley is not being able to play it from what i dont know. The whole bottom section to fuse, or play a match turns dark and i cant tap anything. Still love the game, easy to strengthen Pokemon as you battle and keeping it interesting with every update.  But that's only if it works",
        "Edit: the app has been getting worse and worse. There are a ton of problems with matchmaking, and pay to win is the way now. They refuse to fix the major problems in this game. Plus they just added a new terms of service that states they aren't responsible for those problems with the game. One of those things could result in you losing all the progress on your account or the account completely.",
        "Every time I play I hate it more and more. The only reason I still play is because I made the rookie mistake of paying for stuff in the game. Matches are rigged, whether intentional or not. My Pokemon have a Miss space of 1 and somehow hit it EVERY SINGLE TIME?!?!?!?! I don't think so homie. Spinner is rigged so don't play if you actually want to be the very best there ever was because the computer will not let you. Game is full of bots that just so happen to have the perfect team to beat you once you start doing well"

Nobody can afford  to buy coins every 5 or 10 minutes  playing the games are fun but you only get like 5 or 10 minutes then you gotta build up your coins and it takes about a day or two to do that so its not worth keeping. You have to be rich to play this game. Uninstalling.",

Same thing still happens when a video ad is played to obtain free credits (and very cheap with the free credits), soon afterwards, no sound is heard throughout gameplay.  Bonuses don't come often enough, nor is winning enough to even get on the plus side of the amount of credits I began with (slot play not loose enough).  Shoot, I get better gameplay with the real slots in Las Vegas!",

You have to check all the stars in order to get good pay outs & high bonus spins.                Noticing Im not the only person losing out.. I made a good choice when I decided not to spend my cash money on this game. I would have been ripped off like sever other ppl playing. I have have had several different slot games on my devices. This is the 2nd out of 7 tha hasnt did well.",

No logging in at all. Whats the matter with this? I have Fast wifi Network. But still it doesnt logging in. Do Something if you Devs want your game famous. Thanks. Reply ASAP!",
        "It's a decent game. But don't ever think of recharging. Efun just happily merge servers. I was one of the top players until efun decided to merge several servers together. In the end you fall our of all the rankings, couldn't receive any rewards. So what's the point of recharging? It just basically end your fun. It's Super Disappointing. Stay Clear of any games by them. Remember Don't Ever Recharge.",
        "Your game is good with the nice graphics, i like it. But some bug in game u need to check back. And please make sure your server is secure. Because some people using MOD hack with no skill cd and dmg. If u dont make any update for your game.. sorry, i quit.",
        "The game is nice, but be aware that after your first logout, then you can't play any more. Do not want to connect me to my server!  Don't know what is wrong but from the reviews before mine is look like that I'm not the only one!   DO NOT SPEND MONEY BEFORE YOU MAKE IT SURE THAT YOU CAN PLAY IT ON THE NEXT DAY!",
        "So many hackers and bug.. please fix it! Im serious about this game. But if guys dont do any thing to improve it. I guess alot people will leave soon.. 1hit ko no CD for skill. So many hacks. Your bug is more than any game i played. Please fix it..",
        "its a money making game and no way you can be free player. After merge it sucks more as other states got more stronger and like other games bullying started. Dont know it will be fun or just stay scared in a corner or one best option spend more money to stay alive. There are no features for ppl who want to enjoy game with minimum expenses. Some stuff only available for vips."
