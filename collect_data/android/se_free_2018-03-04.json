        "3 stars because the spins are not giving what is needed for the game. It's a cute game. I enjoy playing with my daughter. However, shields do not spin enough. Sometimes I will go a whole day with no shields and the whole time I'm getting attacked. The other thing is the bonus spin. Never have I won more that 250k coins. I know you want us to pay for another spin but maybe award a higher number once in a while. All in all cute game.",
        "This game was fun initially. But as you rank up, you gain coins and then before you get to even use them, someone is able to steal them from you (by random spinning.. no planned attack!!)   If you play this game,DO NOT SPEND MONEY TO BUY SPINS. People can steal your earnings... so you basically pay actual money, to give others coins...",
        "I need help so I spent $10 in order to get to the next level which I did where I could get my daily spin and hit jackpot and it gave me my fox but I closed the app and it took me backwards to the last level even though I already built in my new level. Please help and put me back to the level ahead of me as this is very upsetting for spending money and being right back where I was before. Fix it and I'll give it 5 stars for everything thank you",
        "I gave 2 star only because when i joined my frnd i did not got any spin..... Though that is shown in my village news...  This is the 2nd time missed the spin.. Do you know it is diffcult to get spin and when you convince a friend to join and you got nothing.....",
        "First everything went okay. But recently I can't download any special event. The game stall when you have  to raid or attack just loading the whole time. Even the spin is now stopping you can press the spin until your blue nothing. Maybe if this is fixed we could try for a higher rating.",
        "I'm  not happy there's no customer service can help to solve the problem. Waiting for the reply but no one care  try to fix this problem before you lost your customer."

        "Needs way more bats i beat this in 3 days and can't get the ball any farther. Add more bats and I'll give 5 stars.  Update: need to make the bats harder to get i already had all the new ones unlocked when i opened the app after the update. Litterally took one swing with the now highest bat and now there is no point to play.  You should make it like 5,000 km for the next update or something.",
        "Great game! I really love it and its great to play when you want to pass through time. My only issue i have is that my upgrades are so high that i go over the side barrier almost every time. I feel it would be awsome if, like bats, you could unlock new balls. Also, online leaderboards would be awesome, so we can see who holds the current record.",
        "One thing is bombarding everyone with ads, another is: 1. There is no sound whatsoever. 2. The whole purpose of the game is getting a new bat.  3. There is no point of hitting it down the middle because it will hit something and bounce back thousands of feet.  Overall this game sucks! About the ads?  I've learned 1 thing: If you see a game on an ad? When you download that game, it will be flooded with ads. That's just how that works...",
        "The game is awesome but there are way to many ads between pitches. Cmon man!! I get it u want to make money.. So how much does it cost to have an ad free Baseball Boy? I feel like 99 cents would reasonable. Cause everyone would buy it just to not be annoyed by the stupid ads!! 😘",
        "To get the most power you have to also hit it in the same direction every time. Not a hole lot of fun in that. Its a grinding game that every two swings it's a 15second ad if you are lucky. If not expect to spend just as much time playing as you do watching ads, if not less.",
        "Bloody adds. Relax with the adds. There way way way way way way way you too many adds. Every time you play you gotta wait for an add to finish. It's disgusting. Whats the world coming too. Rather pay a dollar and have no adds. You guys messed up big time by making this an add flogging game. Hang your self's from a tree by your throat. Hope you get cancer."

It's only happened once to me and I'm on level 41. Now that's saying something. It gives you a super good promise and nope it's gone out the window as soon as you get the game",
        "I have been playing for a while now, I like almost all of the game, not too impressed that \"the piggy bank \" is basically held to ransom until you buy it... find another way to entice spending... reduce number of coins won or something but as the levels get hard if you dont spend money you get stuck even with team helps.. it gets disheartening and reduces interest after a while.. to the gamemakers: keep the game playable..the money will come",
        "Update...as I go though the levels Ill get stuck for a day or two...even 3 on a level. Gameplay FUN has Dropped significantly. Moved to 3 stars as a result. If it does not change I'll continue to move to 1 star. Games are many to be played...not just stuck on a level forever!  Other issue with the game is that there's so much clicking and waiting once you win. I wish that it would just go right to the next level and it wouldn't have to wait for the splash screen. I just spend so much time wasted versus playing",
        "Oh my gosh, this game is so much fun! I have a dentist appointment coming up, so I got this game to settle my nerves. I'm having such a good time playing, I know this will be just the thing to help me out! 😀 Thank you 😄",
        "Don't waste your time playing this game.  I got too 300 + levels but you get 100 coins for completing each level.  Unfortunately it goes in a piggy bank, which you need to pay to break starting from £1.99, then next piggy bank was £4.99.  It's a con!",

Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I'm newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.",

What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!",

That's forgiveable because it's out of the way and doesn't really affect gameplay. It's the fail-state adevertisements that constantly interrupt retrys that will irritate even the most casual of gamers.   The only people writing good reviews for this game are bot accounts.",
        "I like the game, BUT it is glitchy. Most of the time when I hit \"continue\" to watch an ad for longer gameplay it freezes, so I have to close the app and start over. When I open the app and start playing the first round, an ad pops up and I inevitably click on it because I'm in the middle of playing the round. Please fix these issues, and I'll try to remember to rate this higher once they're fixed.",
        "Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.",
        "Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don't want a load of wasted time, don't download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time."

Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",
        "Could add more city's it sucks revisiting and not getting new characters.. also the special city boards could have some special effects instead of ... I don't know... looking like a hot dog... what's the point. A hot dog with super speed and stay low would be ideal. Love the game, but to keep playing.. maybe give us something new. The only thing I love is wordy weekends. But only to get the coins back for what I spent on the characters",
        "Sometimes, the game glitches and it's just very annoying when I have the super boots on and I jump on top of the train and then it glitches and the police catch me!  Apart from that very good game but I think the company just needs to improve the graphics...",
        "I love this game so much! My favorite thing is the awesome characters, and cool cities they visit. I like how it is a offline game, so you can play it anywhare. I also like the wordy weekend challenges, and the fun events everyday. This is one of my favorite games!",
        "You think if you have your Facebook added to the game if you get a new smart phone. Your info well transfer over the player you earn. And coins. But the don't so I won't ask my friends to play it till you fix this problem."

        "Its a nice game! But it just takes forever to open a new level. Sometimes your on one for days. That's just to long. That's why I pay farm inland. You can play for hours with out bring stopped no lives. . I want a game that's fun and relaxing. No hard or extra hard ones. I really like cleaning and fixing thing. Be nice if you could do more area and less puzzle.",
        "I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don't like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",
        "This game is awesome. But the stars, please increase the amount of star not just 1. Make it 2 for the Hard Level. And lastly, it's hard to download new rooms when it always appear the Technical Error. Better if you do not require to download it and the user can open it without connecting to internet. However, the game is great for relaxing. Keep up the good work!",
        "Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought \"Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements.\" but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)",
        "Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it's advertised too much, but it's definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That's slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.",
        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can't wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!"

I mean when I first downloaded it there was only 6 levels XD  I know that should be a good thing but I can't seem to finish them all lol. GREAT GAME!!! DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW!!! LIKE... RIGHT NOW!!! IT'S AMAZING AND I BET YOU'LL HAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 4 MONTHS!!!",
        "Loved this app so many choices and creativity it looked like you worked hard on it so I think you put a lot of effort in it and also There's barely any adds so this is amazing you all should get this app cause its fun and a great time killer !  :P ITS AMAZING AND I LOVE IT",
        "This game is fun but one problem.  My ball keeps randomly rolling off the edge for no reason. Plz fix this then u will get 5 stars.",
        "This game is great. The levels are challenging and fun but personally I think this game could be a lot better if you added a level editor so you could make levels and post them online for others to try. This would totally make your game a lot more exciting and fun.",
        "It's a great game, but after about 5 or 6 months it doesn't load probably get it but be aware that sometimes it won't load I have it and it is terrible that after a short time it won't load the game!Please fix this!",
        "I like this game. Just a few complaints. Massif should still be the first level and the head song of the game with the exception of the new level song playing. Please!!!!"

        "The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn't receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.",
        "I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn't allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn't do and I was charged another $4 when I didn't even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn't even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I'm taking this here where others can see. Don't spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There's no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.",
        "Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you're out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.",
        "I got a new phone and I installed this game on it and it put me on level 5. I was on level 32. I had 56 stars and my combat power was on 72000. If it don't update the game with my current data I don't think I am going to play it anymore. I don't want to star all over again.",
        "Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care",
        "Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!"

        "I just got the new update and now my mouse wont work plz fix this! :( i realy love playing but its not working so whats the point. (for crombook users) MY ACCOUNT NAME IS IVANA324 no upercase letters",
        "This game is very laggy D: you should get 50 robux to people when they first start it would be handy and you should be able to make tycoons it would be WAY more fun for people if they did start win robux there should be a daily reward!!!! Thanks alot please choose this suggestion.",
        "It has a wide range of great games, but ROBLOX is flooded with OD'ers (Online Daters). That is mainly the reason I rarely play anymore, because ROBLOX is just gready and only wants money, so they took away great features of the game that made it great.",
        "I actually love Roblox so much because then you get to like the same things and it's good for creating jobs and stuff what you want for an example jailbreak jailbreak as an awesome game that has a game that you can actually brainstorm ideas what you can do to escape the jail although that is kind of seminar for you to get in jail and breaking out for it too real life but it's just a game",
        "The game is perfect, bit there's one thing I need to know: how do you equip t-shirts? I can't find an option for it in avatar customozation. Other than that, great game.",
        "This game is awesome because I can play with my friends and family,also there is so many games in one.But the only thing I got mad about this game is that you have to pay money just to get robux to dress your character😢.But its still a good game"

        "Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.",
        "This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don't worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you'll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!",
        "I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who's better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn't seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don't think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.",
        "It's been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there's no rhythm at all. Why don't you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it's only getting worse..",
        "I'm in love with this game. It's challenging, you don't have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.",
        "there seems to be a malfunction with sound. I've played several songs and each one has parts where there isn't any music. I'm not sure if this is a bug or just something wrong with my phone. other than that, though, this app is really entertaining."

I like the whole concept of the resetting for fame but it doesn't really make sense.. but don't mind that, it's just a game after all! I am having fun with the app so far, but I might get bored of it later. We'll see I guess! :-)",

        "I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don't do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤",
        "In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it's just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.",
        "AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)",
        "I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It's kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺",
        "Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao",
        "Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren't 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of \"Relaxing\". Thank you for your consideration."

It's very frustrating to me because I have hit the targeted first Star and had recently hit ALL THREE Stars showing normally that I completed the Goal. No dice. I hope someone fixes this bug soon. It's making me not want to play anymore and I love playing this with my kids.",

        "I love this game. It's so good. HOWEVER, I paid for 50 gold bars and one of each extra(i.e. Pinwheel, lollipop, striped candy, etc...). After the payment went through, I only received 14 gold bars and NO extras. Please help. I have been stuck on level 348 for several weeks, because of that blasted bomb, and need the extras to help pass it. Do you have a hint on how to pass this level?",
        "I'm stuck on level 3008 and have been for over a week. I nearly get passed it, then a bomb from no where hits my game. It doesn't help me win, it rips through my whole game. I'm fed up completely now. I'm giving it a break now. Bored.",
        "Dear King games, Really dislike the newest update that makes the candy ball explode just because candy explodes due to a 3piece explosion on such.  It messes up strategies bc it explodes prior wanting tp be used. Please change back"

        "I love the game it is so simple yet super fun. Just the only down side is that there are WAY to many ads. I stared playing a round and then an ad pops up.. Like really. At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:",
        "Don't get me wrong this app is addicting and fun. The thing that ruins this app is ads. For a game were it is meant to be played in quick bursts and you aren't meant to succeed for long periods of time, i don't understand how you can put an ad after every attempt. Sure one per 3 to 5 games and the another 30 second ad, but at the rate they come this game isn't fun anymore. The craziest thing to me is that i can't find a way to invest a few cents into the app to perma-block the ads. Come on dev i know you can do better than this. I will adjust the rating when i am offered a solution. Until then this 4 to 5 star app has 1 to 2 star potential.",

The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling.

It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",

The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!",
        "Its amazing and highly addictive. Actually one of the few games that not only hold my attention but my kids as well. The only two issues I have is when lag strikes its basically impossible to play conssidering your hand takes up part of the screen anyway. Then every time you die you have to close out of an add. Which if you have a curved screen some of those are hard to close out of.  It would be really cool if in addition to building your own you could create your own list of worms youve made and name if you want."

        "I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn't working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn't show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.",
        "There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen",
        "I really like this game, especially now that new levels were added and different areas instead of just the daily challenges and up to level 99, but since the update I have to do the daily challenges twice before it accepts that I've done them. Every single day it resets my daily challenges after having just completed the new daily challenge. It's irritating.",
        "This game was very addictive I used to play it everyday.This new update sucks. Nobody likes so you mise well change it back because you were getting better reviews. I am going no further with this game and deleting. Folks pleaseeeeeeee don't waste your time in this game unless your a lonely man or women with 30 cats",
        "Its alright but theres too many ads. All adds are 30 secs and mostly unable to skip. I dont mind ads but the come up even when I'm in the middle of a level, making it near impossible to do anything, so I'm uninstalling it for that reason.",
        "Sadly, it could've been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable."

If you have a new and protected phone, get the game, but if you have an old phone, do not get this game. IT WILL GIVE YOUR PHONE A VIRUS AND YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING ON IT!!!!!!!!",
        "I really like playing the game, it's fun with all the different character mechanics, but after the last update there has been a huge increase in ads that take me away from the game and open up play store or chrome. It does this in the middle of a round, so obviously it screws up my gameplay. Makes me consider paying for no ads, but also makes me want to delete.",

TOO MANY SPAM ADS SAYING MY SYSTEM HAS A VIRUS ALONG WITH ADS SAYING I WON A GIFT CARD.....JUST HAVE TO REGISTER ONLINE ETC... DO NOT D.L",
        "It's an amazing concept and idea that is very entertaining. The bad thing is that the ads interrupt the game so constantly that it messes up your shots and your online games too.  If that can be fixed so they appear after a match not in the middle of one that redirects you to a page full of ads and false notifications, then it will be a very awesome experience.",

        "I WANT to like this game. It's fun. The problem is the ads (I'm fine with ads. It's a free game) but mid game it randomly opens ads. I'm talking the kind that take you to a whole new window and tell you your phone is infected and won't let you go back without closing that tab. It screws up your shots and it's just NOT ok. Please fix this mess and I'll redownload and give the game a better review. Ads are one thing but when they make the game unplayable, I have to delete the game."

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱",
        "I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It's a pretty good app and I've sent many people to download your app.",
        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure."

        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "I paid the price to get the ads removed, because I like to support developers and because there were a LOT of ads. The ads were never removed. I have contacted the developers more than once and received no response. Then I contacted the Play Store and they rejected my claim. Now I have paid for the ads to be removed and they are still there at a level that makes the game unplayable. Worst customer service ever; what a waste of money. I will remember this developer and never download another of their apps.",
        "Terrible game. I can't pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something.",
        "Far too many ads. One here and there is understandable but after every single try, you get an add. Definitely uninstalled for that reason. As far as the game itself, it's really fun and could be addicting but I spent more time trying to get through the ads than I did playing the game.",
        "EDIT TO PREVIOUS REVIEW: I PAYED FOR AD FREE AND REINSTALLED IT AND NO LONGER HAVE AD FREE!  I loved basically all of it except... If you don't buy ad free the game is completely unbearable with how many ads there are. Also I absolutely hate how it kicks me out of the challenges after I die if I tap too many times or I hold the screen while waiting for it to load."

        "This is a great game but the bottom line is the developers want you to spend money upgrading. You get along so far upgrading with coins, which can be earned. Then they want tokens, which you must buy, to go further. The deals on weapons that are offered are always just out of reach. You can earn diamonds watching videos but I would rather play a game than waste time watching stupid add so I can play a game. It was fun but no more. Deleting.",
        "It is far too difficult to advance in this game without spending money. The developers get money from ads, and I'm willing to watch them, but not for 1 diamond every 30 seconds, when the smallest upgrade in weapons is 360. They must not want people to keep playing an otherwise good game.",
        "This is the most grindy game I have ever played. To get anywhere close to a smooth play through, you have to spend obscene amounts of money. It'd be just as much money to buy a PlayStation 3 and fallout 3, and you'd have better graphics, better shooting, and shorter load times. Plus, every level and every gun has to be downloaded separately. It's over 200 mb for me, and I only played for a day and got to level 2!",

        "Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don't play this game  you'll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase",
        "Not a good game for new players.  Was fun and  interesting at first but you qucikly realise that you are just food for high level players with no way to reach a defensible level.  High level players basically teleport in, raid everyone and teleport out.  They should lock servers to keep it balanced and give more guidance for new players. This game is  clearly weighted towards the people who have been playing it the longest. Dont waste your time",
        "Kingdom 249 is open before just 50 days back. And one guild have 2B might. Most of the guys have millions of might one of them got 700M might. How's this is possible. Kingdom 277 is opened before 15 days back but one guild K03 got more powerful. Top guys got 120M might in just 15 days. Does IGG employees playing this game. We are lover of this game please don't lose your credibility. This two kingdom which I observed only Chinese players are strong. How overall kingdom only Chinese players got higher might in less time.",
        "Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don't mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.",
        "This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.",
        "Troops die just because you are not sheltered or shield...Strengthen all troops and walls even defenses and masters... Also lessen the price of buying shields it cost a lot of gems and longer is effectivity like if it is 1day update it to 1day and 12 hrs and cost it 1.6kgems is good mostly for us busy people"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.",
        "It is an amazing game. Our entire family is hooked and i love the idea of neighbourhood chat on hay day it is awesome!!! Continue making this game as cool as it is👍. However it would be nice to have private chat on hayday where the entire neighbourhood does not see your conversation. There is also a glitch where i cannot open my daily videos."

    "description" : "Children's doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames",

And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. 💘 the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants 🐟 and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with 🎶 turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A☆' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it's a great game lol I enjoy playing it.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.",
        "Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can't do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!"

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I'm not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr",
        "Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I'm paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn't make it worth the price being asked.",
        "I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren't here. They don't connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw",
        "Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars",
        "Its good fun but extra world tour levels are needed to sell the full game, both after purcgase and before. But if you delve into the crevices of each mode and extract every bit of play you'll find out whether it's worth it",
        "I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you're going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game"

        "I used to play this game a couple years ago, and at the time, it had satisfying gameplay and great time killing qualities. I used to love it then and I still do now, but I've recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that's driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn't allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I'm not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.",
        "Marvelous game!!! Likely you back to the right on your last update.  I just purchased the chainsaw blade, the DRAGON blade was a huge desappointment we was expecting phenomenal motions not that catoon flag . Also : all the good stuff are in mini game, the others dojos are kind very less quality, let us use minigame blades and dojos in arcade or zen even by purchase that will be nice. Thank you",
        "I don't really mind having to watch ads to get bonus items or XP, but the forced 25 second videos after EVERY DAMN GAME is just too much; it's way faster to just close the app and open it again, but it really destroys the game experience",
        "This fruit ninja is great! However, I sorely miss Fruit Ninja: Puss In Boots, and I'd really like it back!",
        "They should add that you can give your friends starfruit and that you can friend people      PLEEEEEEEEASEEEE ADD AND UPDATEEEE!!!!",
        "I love it! My whole family was telling my friends to download it and they just love the whole game. Anyone who doesn't like the game are just saying that so people don't download it. DON'T listen to them liars! Keep up the good work. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"

Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I'm thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven't even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that's all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.",
        "So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂"

Every time I try to open it I get a pop up that says unfortunately my shelf has stopped and gives me a choice to report or just hit ok and I usually hit ok and try again so I did that 3 times then reported the issue and it has not been solved. I jjst tried the game again and reported the issue again, but I don't think it will be solved so I'm just going to delete this game and redownload choices and my story which is a way better game then this one will ever be.

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "Don't get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It's kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I've unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made."

        "Good game to pass your time. Upgrade costs and parts spawn rates are reasonable if you only use a few vehicles because it will take a long to yo max out everything. I think it will be better if league vs trophies distribution are reworked because its very easy yo reach legends. should give a higher win bonus at higher trophies i think to make it more competitive. And lastly, hackers should be deleted from leaderbord.. there are a few impossible timings on the board.",
        "I enjoy the game greatly. It's slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I'm not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game",
        "I love this game. Every game I've had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I've unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn't almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.",
        "If you don't want to give away free stuff from the chests, don't. But stop wasting my damn giving me these \"free\" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.",
        "Constant ads.  Excruciatingly slow progression unless you pay.  Game crashes more than I crash in the game.  Could have been a great sequel to HCR 1, but it feels like playing a money-grab instead.",
        "Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn't mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝"

        "Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts",
        "Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that's just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)",
        "Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn't that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.",
        "I love this game! Been just playing on my wife's account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won't even register me moving. I've tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what's going on?",
        "thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location",
        "Can you developers make it so people can trade pokemon and other things like items? Itll make the game sooooo much better if teamates could trade items and Pokemon. People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.",
        "The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game"

However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",

The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.",
        "Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it's a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid"

        "This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!",
        "This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you're willing to go broke",
        "Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it's great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager's and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don't have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I'm just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃",
        "Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.",
        "Great game but I have been trying to figure out how to chat. before any recent updates when the graphics were different I somehow figured out to chat with someone, but now I can't remember! plz plz PLZ tell me how to chat, and if u removed the ability to chat can u add it in again?",
        "Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses."

Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don't use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game."

The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??",

        "So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, \"Thank-you\"  for a truly  wonderful game.",
        "Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are 'rolling points' that I haven't figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different 'skins' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I'm having fun. Maybe you can too.",
        "The graphics, controls, n the gameplay are ALL 5 by me. I was expecting this game to be boring but finally, i downloaded it n it was a BLAST! I could NEVER take my eyes off this game as its AMAZINGLY fun. I was not expecting it to be THAT fun, but it was!!! There is absouloutly NOTHING WRONG about this game. The only  thing that is wrong is when people say bad things about this game. But there are NO glitches, barely no adds n NO expectations! This game is absouloutly my MOST favourite  game OF ALL the others.👍",
        "Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.",
        "Nice game I like it very much and in game if we don't have money so they ask watch and after watching video they give 100 or 200 Rs the game is very long and after win we got a new Ball",
        "This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game."

But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤",
        "Everything players have asked for is added. At a ridiculous price.  But if people are paying that's on them.   HOWEVER you shouldn't have to buy the adult /baby formula more than once. If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.",
        "This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren't for the ADS. I get it's a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It's one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.",

Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea",
        "Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.",
        "What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don't even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can't place anymore and you lose.",
        "Would like to sometimes when my score is really high get a second chance to redeem myself. Other wise I like the game - kills some time when needed👍",
        "This is very deceiving. It looks like it's Tetris, but it's not. The pieces don't come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it's not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.",

The button still shows up when i play the game tho. What do i do?",

It won't give the  ad to unlock all floors. I already answer the question but it won't give the ad. Because of that I'm started to hate this f***ing games. If you repairs it I gonna love this game only if you repairs it. Please repairs it before I sue you. My father was a policeman.",

The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players.

        "What happened to the game I used to enjoy? Now everything is turning into a spam fest. Strategy has been consistently removed from the game with each update. BH still has a bunch of AI issues. For the first time ever (as a max 11 and misc other accounts) I can honestly say uninstalling has crossed my mind.",
        "Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!"

        "I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It's fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn't want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.",
        "This game is have potential, don't ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I'd end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!",
        "Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It's reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis's and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I'm offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,",
        "Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.",
        "Its now just a money grab... not happy with the way this game is going, it used to be a fair rewards system, with decent quality gear, then it changed to become basic gear almost all of the time, then it became difficult to prestige since it was have good rockets and a lifter or don't win and now you actually get very little for your hard work climbing the ranks. Waiting 24 - 48 hours for a reward doesn't cut it for me."

        "This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it's pretty awesome!",
        "Best game period. Not just golf or sports game, but any game. Wouldn't change a thing. All ya all who say, oh they need to change this or that, and why do I have to play someone who's better than me? Well it's because you suck, and you have no hand eye coordination. Just shut up and dribb, uh I mean play. #1 game for a reason peeps. Love ya. Dueces. Peace biatches.",
        "Game is based on luck. Could be so much better if it was more realistic ie club selection. How can it be fair when it is easier to chip in from off the green than it is to hole a putt? NEED TO FIX BUG THAT MAKES MY SHOT HAPPEN WITHOUT MY FINGER LEAVING TABLET SCREEN!!! HAS COST ME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COINS!!! When are you going to fix this issue??? If this was my game I would be extremely embarrassed with all the fault's",
        "Stop changing the winf its getting boring now !!  I mastered the wind only for ypu to make it not work in in some games or even make the wind twice as strong as the value stated. You should be matched on games played not trophies. Otherwise the good players who go up the trophies quickly always play people with better clubs. The game goes easy on you if you're not good at it which defeats the point of getting good",
        "This game is really starting to piss me off.  Main issue I'm having is the stupid game freezing and telling me it's trying to reconnect in the middle of a game.  I'll make a shot then it will continue to count me down and tell me I'm out of time.  Freezes until my times up. I've lost close to 200k in coins lately and it's really starting to piss me off. Also, never consistent. I'll make a near identical shot as my opponent and ball travels completely different. Really starting to piss me off. Been playing this game for a LONG time and I'm about ready to delete it!",
        "It's cool but everyone seems to be fairly good so all matches come down to a shoot out. Meh. And in the shootouts your opponent can see ur shot if u go first. Meh. All kinds of perks for FB. I don't have FB. Meh. Have to spend $$ to get decent clubs and balls or play this 24/7 and I won't do either lol. Nice try tho playdemic. Cheers."

        "I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks",
        "This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.",
        "This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That's why I rated this game 5 stars.",
        "I don't like this update. Why does it cost so much to upgrade  weapons 2 more damage higher. And I don't like the fact that all the weapons that have low stars are nerfed. When I was on level 6 the hellraiser was a beast. Then when I got to level 7 I it wasn't as good, so I tried to upgrade it. BUT the price cost 120 coins. I am really disappointed about this. I played this game for 2 years and it sad to see how hard it is to win. They only want money that's it. Make your game better and fair. It's so unbalanced."

Its a good game when it works, which isn't very often for me. And now when I was riding in a three wheeler and a enemy started driving and I crashed, then when I got back I was out of the three wheeler and in the middle of a fire fight and died",
        "I love the game over all. There is one thing that ticks me off the cars. people get them then chase u and knock u down. Once u r knocked down they get out of the car and kill u. IT'S RIDICULOUS. The fact that you cant shoot through the fences makes it so others can use them as coves while u move to them and get killed",
        "Before the update its just normal lag that I used to. But after the update, its getting more lag + delay when try to look around. What I mean is you know when your finger is not sync with character movement (uhh how do I explain this). Sorry my english is terrible. Idk if you get what Im trying to explain. Like 0.5 second delay when look left look right look up look down. Its very hard to aim at enemy and looting and stuff. All of this happen after the Feb 28 update.",
        "This is F ridiculous!! I experienced more glitches after the update!! The updates didnt do anything much about the glitches!! People will just appear from nowhere!! I played this game everyday and every single day i always experience glitches!! The sound is also confusing even if you try to listen.You hear sounds that coming from the back but the enemy is actually in front.",
        "No complaints about the game, i liked it. It's just that i lost my account today and i dont know what's the cause. last time i played it i closed the game when i finished a match by pressing the home button and left it there for a few hours. when i open the game again my account was lost. i forgot to bind my account to any social media because i thought i already binded it by sharing to facebook. is there any way you guys can help me ?",
        "Hi, i really enjoyed the game, i play it every day for a few monts. But one thing that really bother is this game still have a lot of bugs, and cheater - how can enemy shot me while i was behind the tree? And we can get shot too while hiding behind the wall. Please fix this. And one thing, you need to change your system on buying some box. I kept getting the same clothing"

        "This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don't have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I'm having issues getting into the game. It says \"check comnection\" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn't! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "Please bring back the old brewery map. I have been a long time player of this game, and loved the original brewery map. The new update of the map is so radical that it feels like an entirely different map, with all the pathways and corners. The uniqueness of the original brewery map is that it is small, and relatively open, so that combat is focussed and fun. There is more time fighting others than moving around trying to find enemy players. The new update just ruins that uniqueness, making it feel like the Bureau or Legacy map. I am okay with the new brewery map being a new addition, but please make it \"Brewery 2\" and bring back the original Brewery.",
        "Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn't work. PLEASE FIX.",
        "Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn't have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.",
        "I love C-OPS. It is one of the best FPS games for Apple and Android devices. It is very popular, few servers are empty. On lowest settings with 2 gigabytes of RAM, it runs at a BUTTERY 50 frames per second. Also, controls can be customized. I just notice a few graphical glitches.",
        "I love the game, it's great and there's not many fps games like these for mobile phones. My only problem is I can never play ranked. For whatever particular reason I can't even find other players. The game just stays searching forever and I really want to play ranked. I would have voted 5 stars but thats the only thing that bugs me. Please fix and will be happy to give 5 stars."

        "What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn't be playing it if I couldn't play as Pac-Man, he's such a good inclusion. It's a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you're prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.",
        "Game looks good and it's well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m",
        "This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven't tried it. It's occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!",
        "This is a pretty cool sonic game for moblie for 1 it's cool for 2 you can unlock other sonic Characters and for 3 other characters from other games will come too like Mrs. Pac man!",
        "Sonic is my favorite and I know all the forms but put all in the game for 100 or 150 red rings. I'm sonic number one fan ! Plz do it .",
        "I love the new updated keep up the good work and thank you for making us vs people online this the way to earn more rings and red stars rings"

Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it's really bad, and it's insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.",
        "You cannot walk on wooden fundations and you cannot walk on single or double foundations. Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it",

        "I'm 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",
        "Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I'm sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP",
        "I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can't make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!",
        "I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least",
        "This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I'm eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐"

        "This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest's and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven't tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.",
        "Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a \"slide,\" I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don't compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.",
        "Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.",
        "I love all the graphics it's a bit like the        piano tiles it test's your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.",
        "It's my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn't quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a 'save me,' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it's a brilliant game.",
        "I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven't come across anything that I've had to spend money on in order to advance in the game"

        "Was a great game til the update. Now I have to open it twice for my energy to update and for the money in the pawn shop to change. Also when I bargain with clients now it's alway a negative profit compared to before. More annoying then anything",
        "It's a fun game my only complaints are that you have to wait until your energy refills. There is no way to earn energy and you should make it so you can customize and/or upgrade your shop. Make it more exciting. Also you open the building that say they will finish construction soon because the game gets boring if there no excitement added to it.",
        "I enjoy playing this game. Currently I have two major problems with it.  1. I wish I could change orientation based on how my phone is tilted.  2. I tried to have Mutt trade something really expensive and now it freezes every time I attempt to open the trade.",
        "Cool. Fun. But your guys really need to fix the bugs. I would load it and keep it open doing certain things (playing a auction getting a item appraised and it would FREEZE or take absolutely forever. I would have to close the game out and re load it."

        "I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I'm not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain't getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold",
        "Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you're willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much."

There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",

Poor marks because it takes so much of your hard earned levels and drops you down the ranks if you don't solve immediately.  I was at ruby level and have so many points taken away now I am back to silver....uninstalling thanks for nothing.",
        "I really enjoy this game, its quite addictive but i find it very satisfying. The only problem with it is that once you get into higher levels (i'm at 300) you start needing tons of stars for small things and for instance to get rid of one stump takes like 8 stars. Anyway I like the game and am going to keep playing it.",
        "I use the love this game and have played it for months, but the lasted update ruined it for me. Every time you don't finish a level it asked you a second time if your sure to want to lose this or  that. I don't apreciate the guilt trip to try and get money out of me. It's dispicable and unethical!",
        "If I could give it 0 stars I would. There is no way to contact support and you can't restart the game. I got a bad download and now I'm stuck with it. My personal information should not be part of playing a match 3 game anyhow. Game crashes at least once a day and my controls only work about 60% of the time. Horrible experience! Playrix should be ashamed of their programming here.",
        "The game is awfully hard for what is essentially a match 3 game. For a game that is supposed to be as much about the storyline as it is about the matching, it sure doesn't want you to advance that storyline. It's more about the very obvious money grab than it is about game play. Do yourself a favor and don't waste the space downloading this game. There are much more enjoyable match 3 games on Play. There's a reason it's the #3 grossing game on Google play. It's all about how much you are willing to spend, not about the actual play."

        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.",
        "It's an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It's all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p"

        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.",
        "Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn't need to have the internet on. Don't know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.",
        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",
        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore."

        "Ah perfect game. Fast pace not laggy smooth graphics, and playable on any devices. But i hope i can change my region like asian.. Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "There is nothing as satisfying as sniping a person a kilometre away with a modified SCAR with a 4X scope, except for winning the match. There is a single problem though. SMG bullets do absolutely no damage with no attached scope, up to a certain distance when I put the aim mode on. Could you change that and make the damage at least 5? Other than that this game is absolutely amazing.",
        "The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It's intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it's voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.",
        "I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you'll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.",
        "It's a pretty solid effort at a battle royale genre it need more customization however maybe another map and just a tad smoother on the game mechanics. Also if it could hit the 100 player per match marker that would be great but I understand that the map must be smaller so it might get a little too crowded.",
        "I love this game so much, but what about more structures? Also I wish there was a chat in game that you can just type instead of voice chat, also the number one thing I wish you guys could add in or fix is the snipers bc they are weak... also I think there should be a counter somewhere when people dismount the plane so we can Dee how much are still in plane and how much already left  That's all"

Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character",

        "The game is cool but there's a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won't let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit",
        "It's a bordom filler but that's about it. Is kind of boring it's self but I like it. It's a pretty cool game. Good job on the graphics tho. The animations are really nice. The gameplay functions are really simple. I give it a good solid meh"

        "Very annoying problem with Google Play account disconnections at task swap. Fix this, and I will be able to actually play the game. Since I use my phone for making real income, I need to swap screens to other activities, and each time do a four step log in process back into the game. I have never seen this problem before in any other game, no reason this game would be different. About the game? Well, I'll tell when this problem is gone 😅",
        "It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn't cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.",
        "Boring!! Hurry up and wait. Never enough coins and forge points. Constantly waiting for buildings to make money and points. Ready made buildings. Can't build your own. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Been playing about 2 hours and already bored to death!",
        "Although FoE is very enjoyable, it can get very complicated, especially for new players. The biggest drawback is the lack of instructions...new players, unless taken under the wing of an experienced player, have to fumble through at first, many times guessing or using trial and error to accomplish the simplest things.",
        "At first I was a little unhappy with the amount of stuff I can do with spending diamonds, but I now find it refreshing, not to spend active hours on a game in order to receive a reward. I'm glad they reward patience.",
        "Started playing, made some progress, then the next time I went to play it wouldn't link back to my Google account and kept saying incorrect password. You get one star because that was frustrating and I couldn't get back to the game I already made progress on. UNINSTALLED..."

        "The gameplay is of course billion perfect and also the graphics!!! If any 1 wanted to play any interesting game....THIS IS THE ANSWER: goat simulator!! But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn't die??!!! and that's a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it's perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!",

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn't seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.",
        "I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I'm very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn't get my prize and I'm really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I'm expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.",
        "Awesome online multi-player but less choices of kits and bags take too much time to be opened.Also there is some lag faced while playin with data connection hope you'll fix that for my device. A little optimization would make it better"

I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn't my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark \"Xxx\" and I'll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍",
        "I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I'm disappointed, expecially for the \"restore purchase\" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.",

        "I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what's the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?",
        "Winnings suck. Instructions are very vague. Way too many ads. Feel like in order to play you have to pay in order accomplish levels and continue story campaign. Sorry guys but I bet my criticism has been said over and over again. Result is boredom. Too many other games to waste my time playing. Need to fix these if you wish to keep this game on the market people!!!!",
        "It's a really fun game, but sometimes you'll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don't get another life afterwards. It's hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn't be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.",
        "i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.",
        "OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can't stop playing it!",
        "I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don't change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don't get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn't have done that then I would be impressed by the game."

        "It's a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It's amazing and extremely addictive!!",
        "I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!",
        "I gave the game another chance after my last review because the game is fun but it is my last time.. I am uninstalling and never again playing mlbb. I got afkers on my team in 4 consecutive classic games, and I still get feeders even though my rank is quite high.. why do I get paired up with feeders, I have no clue.  Goodbye mlbb, was great when I acually got a decent team and is actually capable of winning instead of having no chance at all and get trashtalked by opponents thinking they are all that.",
        "Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here's some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.",
        "I like the game. My low rating is because I had to reset my phone and now have to go 8 lvl again just to reload into my account. It's bad enough you are forced to play the practice modes over again but lvl 8 is almost to ranked again. Why put that time in again. Lvl 5 maybe/understandable. But you've made me not want to play this game anymore and it's sad because I enjoyed it",
        "Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven't already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out"

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn't go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I'd like to. Please improve it.",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!"

        "So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It's not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they're also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I'm a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you'll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.",
        "Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can't change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....",
        "This is by far the most fun I've  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!",
        "Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that's by design so I spend money. Which I won't do. I just want some \"bubblegum\" to past the time.  Now, it's making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...",
        "I  love this game but why does it take 30 minutes for a life to refill and also why does everyone who plays the game not receive ten lives only some of your players this needs to be fixed it's not fair I've been playing for years and only receive five lives at a time when others receive ten lives.I play other games and the lives refill every 7 to 15 minutes. Can you please make changes",
        "Nice game challenging to think ahead. But, basically this game is cheating on you. Levels are far too difficult to complete without boosters. So, after failing several times the not so random appearing tiles give you a lot of boosters. That prevents to uninstall (at least until you master the highest level and you enter the Legends Arena) !"

        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don't know, and it's a pretty small issue so I don't really care.",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying."

        "Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls"

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren't too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",

        "I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels \"fixed\" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.",
        "This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.",
        "I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn't really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don't know how many more points you need.",
        "This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don't like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.",
        "Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the \"boards\" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it's addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It's becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.",
        "I don't know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I'll say that. I didn't need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I'm out."

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",
        "This is game is ok if you are bored and don't know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game",
        "I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat",
        "This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you",
        "It is impossible to pass and the controls where do I start the ball goes tooooooo fast and it's impossible I don't recommend to download this game. But if u want to download it (which u won't). DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Bye."

Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.",
        "Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.",
        "This is for the makers of this game you need to introduce rules so that players who either work for the makers or spend 100's to become strong very quickly... cannot destroy the enjoyment of the game for those of us who would like to grow in the game and play the game properly to become strong through perseverance and hard work... the cash rich players are ruining this game for everyone...",
        "This a pay to win game with lootboxes of different packs. They will keep making you spend with micro transaction of useless stuff to get the real thing you seek. Once, they took my money and the item was not delivered to me because i asked refund before, for a pack called \"hope gemstones pack\" but after 3 times of 20 bucks purchases, i did not get a single hope gemstone. A scam game in a very good way to steal your money. On the other hand, the game is very addictive and well made. If only the developer has a bit of decency..",
        "Need some updates like 2 simultaneously upgrade option. Less but more extensive research. Lengthy process is boring. I know by spending money u can get rid of it but money making shouldn't be always a concern.",
        "Could be a five star game, but needs improvement. Screen zoom is totally non-existant. No zoom out, constant \"finger scrolling \" required. ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT!!!!!   ALSO 1.5 UPDATE?  GREAT JOB GUYS!  YOU FORGOT TO POST THE UPDATE!!!    WHAT A JOKE  They are currently giving APPLE users the 1.5 game upgrade. And gave Android user the middle finger. APPLE users now have a clear advantage over Android users.   So dont talk aboit you vare about customers… they don't . Clearly an APPLE culture designer.  Still haven't posted Android tablet update to ver 1.5 (droid haters)"

        "The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.",
        "This game is a solid mix of \"clash of clans\" and \"fallout shelter\". Just like COC, you have to learn to let the timers cool off. The long term time investment can be very rewarding. The questing/pvp is also well done considering you can't choose what to attack or when during battle. Wholeheartedly a good game.",
        "GG easy. everyone whining being pay to play this that. i never bought anything and I'm loving this, just need a little patience and you can do many things untill one thing gets done or upgraded. I'm high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.",
        "I love the game.  The thing is, this game just gets boring.  For example,  all you can do right now is to vanquish invasions. That's basically it. The portal is not always open.  The tournament? Well the match ups are way too oblivious.  My in game friends already have started quitting coz of these problems. You have to add something fun soon. Well it is still a fun game tho.",
        "Would be a great game if it wasn't blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can't defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don't get attacked too much and lose all your resources.",
        "Been playing since early access relese. Game is very well built. But like all other games. The ads now bugged. The daily quest for the ad has never worked for me. Starts ad restarts app no credit. Oh well its an ad right. Well now your forcing me to watch them. Please fix So can i atleast finish those 2 daily quest?!?!?!  Also since update my androids menu buttons overlay all buttons on far right/left hand of screen depending on tilt. Phone is an LG stylo 3. Please address and i will rerate later."

        "Awful. Have to pay to do anything. You can only play two game modes and only have two teams to play with",

        "Why on earth can I only do 2 game modes what they actually have included for free is great but I can't understand why here is only 2 modes and only 2 teams on face off it also forces me to have ads",

        "It's nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Fantastic game. Real addiction game I'd say. It's an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5",
        "Love this app! I prefer the original version over the walls, hex, etc. and have solved every single one of them. Need more puzzles. Although I'm sure I can solve them all again as it's impossible to remember these. Either way, I cannot get enough of them."

        "This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn't at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you're playing as. Perfect game. 😁👍  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There's an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can't do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.",
        "I think it's incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.",
        "Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company's stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.",
        "I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you're done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.",
        "Truly amazing game. Highly recommended to anyone who likes simulator games. Works without wifi and the developers listen to what u have to say. Sure, there are a few glitches but I'm sure they'll get fixed over time. Loved it Edit: can you transition your gender without having gender dysphoria",
        "First of all, congratulations on the full release! I've been playing this game for a few months now and I'm absolutely hooked. Whenever I'm bored or don't want to use my phone's data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading"

Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like.",
        "It's like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. 👌👍❤",
        "Outstanding game. My only fuss is cars get trapped in some buildings during attempts to retrieve funds. Going back to another stage and returning to the stage I'm engaged in usually resets game play. Otherwise, great game.",
        "It's a chilled game to play. There are a bit too many ads. And it because it is just tapping, it can be a bit boring after a while. It takes long before you get somewhere new. But all by all it's a free easy game to kill time perfectly.",
        "Only game that has not begged for money and really is fun to play if you can keep up with all the fares driver's n cabs. Just try it yourself. It can be addicting if you don't take your eyes from it haha",
        "To get better you must view at least 6, 30+second adverts per day. Or it will be really slow to lvl up."

Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless",

McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn't come back in the next game, but it's understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it's currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they're not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that's the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don't get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could've bought something else with it but I didn't because I like sims.",
        "Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools \"playable\",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it'd be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.",
        "First, I don't like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don't like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you're just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!",
        "For the fact that we can't sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it's a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it's in the real The Sims games.",
        "This is a really nice game and I would have given it 5 stars but because I didn't use Lara Craft to help with the wedding (my sims worked day and night to make those items) but I still did not make it. It's hard to get social points and since I do not have a credit account I could not buy social points. I'm really disappointed because I wanted the wedding to happen 😢"

The only problem is league tournament needs to be worked on. The tournment matches between two league must be a equalised in terms of their player and team rating. Sometimes leagues tournament are so hard..",
        "Hey fifa, it been like this even before the Toty event Almost 2 months, no adds, no stamina for me, this really unfair, all of my friends are getting adds stamina, TOTY, Carniball, and now Lunar year Those eventy went extremely terrible and useless to me with no stamina!!  Please help me and fix this, my app is up to date, and i even re unstall it a few times desperately trying ro get adds back! But it was no good 😔😔",
        "You're fucking shit EA. Your A.I. is overpowered like shit. Our \"chances\" in vs attack are full of bullshit. Money never lasts long when you're playing this shit. Your rewards are pretty crappy too. The \"chances\" when we're opening packs are not chances, it's \"open as many as you want until you have no money left and still haven't gotten anything\". If you're reading this (which you probably won't give a fuck about because you get this everyday), you better make some changes. If you're just hell-bent on making money, then you should go fuck yourself.",
        "The game is terrible the teams are too hard and 2 defenders decked my zardes and then he got red carded hooray!!!!!!!!. Please improve it because it sucks!!!! And why are players so expensive and also if you are going to put someone on sale then why are they reseted to the their to their rating at the start please improve it and at least tell us what you have improved because I know the reason why you don't tell us because you haven't improve anything!!!!!!! You just add more glitches in the updates and make our players worse and also it is so hard to make a team that is rated at least a bit different. I hope to see your next bad update. Keep making your game worse and you will lose the population of people playing. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEXT UPDATE!!!!!"

        "This game is the WORST!!! The controls don't work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn't. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I'm not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I'm the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I'm not trying to be mean so don't go crying😢 to ur boss.",
        "I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",
        "tbh it's a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that's my opinion) And I don't know if it's just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.",
        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups",
        "I really do like this game. It's a good way to learn to think quickly with what side you should move to. Although, it would be even better if you didn't have so many adds, but every rose must have it's thorns and I'd say the adds are this roses thorns."

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.",
        "The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.",
        "One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It's interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that's there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate"

Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!",
        "This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!",
        "This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊",
        "The cars are totally good and pls add some more. The traffic is really bad. Because they are inconsiderate and doesn't care about other cars. How come some of your games has the traffic considerate, Axesinmotion?🤔🤔 In other words, I hope u will do the things above that is mentioned."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "One of the worse cash grabs I have ever seen.  Love the game, but you literally need hundreds of dollars to do any single event and get a decent reward.  Go look at the latest event on their Facebook page.  The reviews are awful, ands it veteran and new players alike.  Game is fun, but they need to cut costs by half to make it worth while."

        "Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?",
        "I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)",
        "This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.",
        "Good for killing time. Some of the computer driven opponents seem to have a very decisive advantage at initial start of certain stages, and some of the smaller vehicles are too sensitive on the controls  but overall decent game.",
        "New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game",
        "Great game, would just love if replays were available to more phones, mine isn't able to do replays yet. Just wondering if it might be coming soon. I've got a Pixel 2."

        "Love the detail of going down to nut and bolts practically to do repairs. Two bones of contention:  The timer to access new barns is too long, does not make for satisfying game play. Also, after purchasing a tool upgrade, I was pleased to see a longer list of repairs gained. Great. Except I couldn't remove the fuel pump to remove the fuel tank. It said my tools needed upgrading for that one part. Please fix that bug so all repairs needed can be made with tool set level.",
        "It's a good game with room for improvement, I've leveled up my tools to level 4 but it's so annoying when it says tools need to be upgraded, this need to be  improved. All so when you fix a vehicle the money could be upped a bit more. I know you can re-paint the vehicle but I wish you could improve the wheels and the interior of the vehicle to make some more money. The other thing that the other paint uses coins how about instead or all so to pay for the other paint with the in game money.",
        "Well let's see ..played the game fixed 7 cars and I made about $70,000 on the game I bought another car and had to replace just about all the parts on it I bought all the parts and was in the process of putting all the parts on it and in the middle of that ,the game shut down on me I opened it back up to continue playing and it had started back over from the beginning at the tutorial and I lost all progress. y'all need to fix this. until this is fixed and or I am put back where I was on the game then I would not recommend downloading this game or any of the other mechanic games for 2018, much less even playing it. it's a waste of time and data also had a trouble with the other 2018 version mechanic game you will see a posting on that one where it's not giving enough time to fix panels and it's not registering clicking on panels to find out if anything's messed up on them .thanks for the problems and the issues. This game is on this phone of mine and the other game is on my other phone developers. You'll see a post on the other garage mechanic 2018 game by Wesley wright. Yaw need to fix these issues ok , because these bad ratings I have been seeing by others isn't looking good for you games.",
        "Game is great but I would've loved some more features or more cars it gets repetitive real fast please add more features like OBD SCAN or inside car customizations also pc version you can change rims and wheels lights bumpers and add more cars not saying you should add all that but maybe some if possible to make it less repetitive",
        "\"Breaks\" is misspelled, and the photo button is in German or something. Cool game, can really help someone learn how a car works.",
        "Hi, I think this game is great, but it has a problem. Whenever I try to scroll on the menus all the items in the menu dissappear.  Would you please see what you can do to fix this?"

        "I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn't be a issue if it didn't take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.",
        "**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.",
        "Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don't make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it's an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?",
        "Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you.",
        "This game truly amazing with beautiful graphics, decent yet easy controls, a large amunt of items and okay customization. The only reason i give this a 4 star rating is because one thing. The hoard mechanic. I mean it's a good concept. The only problem is that there's a hoard every 24 hours. And since wood is kinda pain to get it sucks to come back after work to come to a destroyed house. If it was like every month or heck even every week that would be fine just please give more time than 24 hours for a hoard",
        "Not happy at the moment after the latest updates... No point of spending any cash seeing that you went from getting a loot box to only getting one item at a time... Some parts are still impossible to come by even clearing the infected forest. Hope the next update will be more worthwhile. Apart from that still a good game. Keep it up"

        "This game is mind blowing. The art style is great the animations and the crafting. However u can improve this great game. 1: It would be better if u could tell us what each material is and what can it be used for by adding an information section. Add more building materials. U can add a fence so that we can guard our house and more weapons and types of arrows (🔥 fire arrows, bomb arrows) something like that and more clothing. Also add multiplayer (cuz it would be fun).Overall this is the hands down best survival game on mobile. TBH I thought this game would be a dark souls on mobile but no it's better than that.",
        "I love the game, the crafting system is awesome, the gameplay is great. However, there are some points that I suggest  1. Nerf the Damned, also the Lepers, they are strong for beginners. Club can't beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don't know if it is a bug or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It's a great game to be honest.",
        "It's a good attempt but too easy to die. No water. Seriously? I have an empty bottle yet nothing to put in it. I would like the chance to explore and build BEFORE I die five times and can't reclaim the stuff I've spent time collecting.  If these things are remedied I'll try again. Till then, deleting.",
        "Honestly it's a great game and lots of fun but that energy mechanic needs to change. I know you can walk but it's still such a strange thing to gate your players out of playing.  Maybe if you could always travel at the same speed but if you didn't spend energy you could be attacked randomly while you travel. Or if energy was used to speed up crafting. I dunno but it's the only thing holding me back from a perfect score.",
        "This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.",
        "Very good idea but lack of some stuff like improvements. Right now the demolition system not work and we cannot move the walls or floors. The energy should be more sustainable and will be good if the trees on the base and some stuff randomly spawn. I will drop the game for now and on the future i Will give another shoot"

        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.",
        "Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don't even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.",
        "Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn't be putting people in the \"club\" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this \"club\" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they're INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game"

        "It's a really fun and addictive game with one major flaw. After you start getting to the harder levels, you might as well quit and find a new game unless you only want to play one or two rounds an hour or pay to play. Every level costs coins to play and if you fail a level you are out pretty much your whole hourly allotment of coins. Winning a round doesn't make up for even one loss either. Love the game,  but really annoyed that I can't actually play it consistently enough to truly enjoy it.",

        "(REAL REVIEW! NOT A PAID REVIEWER) Really enjoying the game. It's a good time killer. Some levels are a lot of fun and actually require a little bit of skill. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is there are way too many ads. It will randomly make you watch a video to upgrade your ride or character, and/or to play a level. There's been a few times where I had enough tickets to play, and coins to upgrade my character the two points recommended, and I had to watch a video for all three. Three ads before you can even play a level is ridiculous. I understand that it's a big part of making money for the developers, but I've never had a free game with this many ads. Get rid of some of the ads and I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars.",

I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "Can no longer watch ads to get an extra rewards chest plus, I logged in for 90 days and did not get my legendary chest. My screen froze up when I hit the claim button and had to restart my game. Now my chest is gone and the next level has appeared without me being able to chose what I wanted from the chest.",
        "Caution! Needed access to my personal files including photos to play the game.  I denied and could not start the game unless it had access. Uninstalling after this review.  Don't let programmers and hackers get a hold of your personal files!",
        "Graphics are good, game play can be lame at times when you get birds that are incapable of completing the level. You can't buy the game and that bothers me. I spent $20, (to support the effort) but am trying to keep it at that.  Others have spent $100 and more. Greed ruins this game. Just finished a level that was designed to be beat only by spending money. Spent hours trying but finally paid and beat it. The game play is not consistent. If you have a bad day it will let you win, if you're winning, suddenly an opponent that should never be able to beat you, kicks your ass when you've played perfectly.",
        "It won't let me watch videos. Every time I click on the TV to watch a video for a free bird or arena ticket, it restart the game instead and I lose a life. I hope this gets fixed because other then that it's an addictive game. When the Glitch is fixed I will give a better rating."

        "Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there's an ad, some you can't skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don't even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don't take it away from me. It is beautiful.",
        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion."

        "This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.",
        "Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad's are repeatedly played and I can't skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad's... after 2nd level game is very easy didn't find much interesting..",

        "Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It's not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please",
        "I really like 90% of this game. However, the way the passes are done really suck. I absolutely love when the 30 days unlimited ad free pass comes up for $9.99. Without it I practically refuse to play. It doesn't seem to be available as of a few days ago. I'm glad I recently purchased. Would also be cool to have a feature where you can send passes to friends.",
        "Love this game! The only part I don't like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won't buy any diamonds. I'll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.",
        "I like the game but waiting three hours for two passes is terrible.  And we have no other option to get free passes it is either wait or pay. I feel like I'd we got more than two passes I would be okay with the wait. But waiting three hours knowing I am going to use those two tickets in less than a half hour is crazy.  Then I will lose interest in the story and forget what had happen, it isn't okay. But other than the wait for passes I really like this game.",
        "I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don't mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don't have then you should find a different app.",
        "Its very addictive. But they need to give more gems and free passes. I love the Deep attraction and chain reaction trilogies. Some authors first language arent English, but the stories are still well written.  A lot of profanity used in the gang stories, so be aware of that.  But this is my fave app"

        "An honestly good game with neat intentions, but I do have a complaint that is probably common for other. It's that the game just freezes abruptly and you can't do anything unless you restart it. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly, but other than that it's a good game",
        "Best drag racing game I've played in a while, doesn't force you to spend money but the option is there.  Not in a rush for class E to be released since class D isn't finished yet, in expert races I only see a pink wire frame of the interior and no rev indicator, negatively impacting gameplay since most quests call for these races.  Otherwise great game.",
        "Like the game so far. How do you change the camera view to inside the cockpit. There doesn't seem to be an option anywhere to change camera as advertised. Maybe I'm missing something. Other then that it's very fun game. Thank you",
        "You guys still havent fixed the problem with the boosters for samsung. There is still a x-2 on two of the purple boosters which causes it to not appear when i go to choose it in the race.please fix the problem",
        "It's a fun game but it won't let me buy tires even though I got more than enough money, i have 60000 dollars and cant even purchase a 7000 dollar pair of tires",
        "Really enjoy the game it was easy to get a hang of the controls but there was a minute there i couldnt win however theres always a way to get it done. I like the cars I guess i do sorta wish you could use the expert view at all times but i do like to look at the cars. The loot drops are also better than many similar games. All in all very entertaining"

        "Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don't even mind because it's still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.",
        "The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can't even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.",
        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!",
        "I love this game.  It's very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!"

        "I have completed level 705 but game won't let me move on to next level...keeps saying I'm offline! I'm connected online but nothing I do will let me move on to the next episode. Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message \"go online for more episodes\" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "U want 5***'s, well hard is ridiculously too hard, it has impossible levels that  you only win,  when king wants you to, this is so utterly ridiculous! Really makes me want to uninstall the game. I will give it another try, I'm waiting for the game to divvy out more tries.. I mean 35 tries is stingy for a hard level, how about 45 tries instead?",
        "I'm a addict when it comes to all the candy crushes I'm currently on level 1060 (a really hard level) and I'm  upset cause I get almost threw with that level and the app just close very upset fix the glitch please.. Other then that like I love candy crush but it still get 4 stars!",
        "I love this game but after the latest update I lost things. I had logged in 150 days in a row and loved getting the bonuses each day. Today I logged in and it put me back to day 1!!! I know I logged in yesterday and didn't miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you've earned.",
        "Love this game until my last update, now I have to see after (EVERY) game -Do I want to continue  which involves a purchase or loose what ever progress. I hate to Uninstall being I'm at level 727 & Hitting the (X) does nothing but frustrates me & I'm just about to delete. 😠 Please change some how some way.",
        "One of my favorite games, but after the most recent update, just like most of the reviews in the last several days, I'm stuck at 705. I should be at 1153. Tells me to go online and download new episodes when I'm constantly online. Need to patch it or rework the coding.   Edit: finally fixed, everything is running smoothly. Thanks!"

That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍",

        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",

        "For a shoot 'em up racing android game it's really addictive. I'm always playing it. It's fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!",
        "I would give more stars, because it's very addictive and fun to pass the time. But it just contains WAY TOO MANY ADS. Like holy crap I  get 3 different ads back to back after every single run. Kills my battery quickly and I spend more time watching the ads than I do actually playing the game.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "I really enjoyed this game until it started crashing mid game. Happened to me just recently and I wasted all my available fuel trying to frantically restart the game.  I was just completing the assigned jobs when the game suddenly stalled and I had to restart it again just to find it stalling again, all the while consuming the fuel with each restart. Hope to see this problem rectified soon, otherwise it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.",
        "Epic old school arcade game play meets mobile app heven  This is a great game for any one that can look past In app purchases. Its loaded fool of great charectors and cars that have a usable MP3 player with some tracks . With great leveling up abilities from weapons more powerful weapons. To Nitro 2x points Health and more cars. 5 gas tanks and your either waiting or buying diamonds. What ever it is this game has even more levels . jobs for other charectors. All I now is some of the best old school arcade stand ups with that mobile app. Non stop Rockets and machine Gun blasting with some jams playing in the stereo and little cute pug dogs giving you Xp. Great FUN .....!!!!!!!"

Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",

        "Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.",

        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "One of the few games that I don't mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card's artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!",
        "Dont expect any support for this game. I've been locked out and i am still waiting on a resolution, like many here. I've paid money and i know i wont be getting any compensation let alone how long its going to take to fix it.",
        "Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition"

        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game.",
        "BEST GAME EVER! It's my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There's always something to do, it never gets boring. I've been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It's addictive. You also don't feel pressured to make purchases like other games.",
        "I'm not a game player, but this game is a lot of fun, AND, you never have to spend a dime! Of course, unless you want to spend money!  I do wish the direction went into a little more depth. It would make it a little easier for new people to understand the extra things, like the snow boarding and the regatta."

Even i haven't sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!",
        "One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can't pass anywhere, even though there's nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there's no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.",

        "This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they're back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it",
        "They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It's definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you'll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.",
        "Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don't be fooled. This is a pay to win game.",
        "A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is \"FREE\". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....",
        "I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that's cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!",
        "Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better."

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience.",
        "Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad.",
        "Not bad for free. Minimal ads. The two drawbacks are that in career mode, the game is slanted in the opponents favour too much. And in 1 on 1, it takes forever to load an opponent. Fix that and I would give it a five star rating. Also, it would be nice to see the developer actually respond to some people's concerns."

However I would highly recommend not spending any money on the in game purchases. I got ripped off, luckily with in game currency only and the \"game team\" is adamant that nothing went wrong. If that is the type of support they give I wouldn't want something to go wrong with my actual money. So long story short as long as u don't spend money u should have a good time playing",
        "This had already been done much better. This game allows you to play about 30 minutes before you need to shell out money to compete. Not interested in these crooked games. When are we going to get back to some honesty and not trying to screw customers to get rich?",
        "Love the game defiantly 5* just a couple of comments I hope get read it would be nice to gain some coins through friendly battles with people in your clan. Also if you could see when your group member's were last active it would be easier to sort out our clans. Thanks",

Do you really need money, or Legendaries !? No, you dont !!! I got to castle 8 (3000 Trophies) in 3 weeks with no money and no Legendaries !!! The only thing you need is to have a reliable, supportive clan !!! Dont miss any chests, create consistent deck and have a good decision making in game !!! Have Fun Guys !!! xD"

I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "There should be a full match game like this that isn't scripted. I love it! Should be an energy free mode maybe? As its a bit pay to win\\microtransaction heavy.  They've made some changes, if you like ads and Facebook popping up after everything you do, then this is the game for you, dropped my rating 1 star as a result.  Also took out the ability to watch adverts for in game currency, now you have to pay. Even more of a cash grab now.",
        "Really good game but just wish you didn't always have to go back and start from scratch on certain levels. Oh and maybe make buying the boots and haircuts etc a bit cheaper! Otherwise love it.",
        "Basically a pay to win game. Would be more enjoyable with ads rather than forcing people to wait for 15 minutes to gain less than 1 minute of gameplay as a reward. It's an enjoyable game but not enjoyable enough to pay for."

        "This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!",
        "It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don't even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.",
        "I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don't like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can't buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens",
        "Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!",
        "DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don't think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT",
        "4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I'm well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant"

You're supposed to get free coins but about half the time you don't actually get it after you click the button. I wasted 90 coins and complete a quest and then I received nothing but it clearly thinks I completed the quest because I need to pay another 90 coins to get a new Quest. This is happen like half the time! Sometimes I get no XP for some reason. I don't know what happened to this game",
        "fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don't want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can't play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn't fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix",
        "I love this game on laptop but when i play it on my android mobile the display area is very small compare to its area on laptop. You must built application in a way it can shows up more area on 5 inch display screen so we can see cells comming to eat us. And it can be done effectively by showing things smaller.",
        "Sometimes when I turn well... I skid like I turn and I keep going the same way just for a short time but sometimes I skid inside of someone... It can be annoying... Please please fix it. Besides that. It's good! Thanks for the game!😁 Please fix!😆 And please add the joystick. It can be hard to control It. And also after a while it freezes  PLEASE FIX!!! It's very annoying I really  like  this game I am NOT GIVING UP! AS I SAID PLEASE FIX... Thanks like the io.   Later I HAD TO START ALL OVER AGAIN WHY WHY WHY!!! CAN YOU TELL ME WHY?!?! I LOVE THIS GAME BUT I HATE IT WHEN THIS HAPPENS NOW PLEASE FIX IT!!!!😡😡😡",
        "What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can't even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it's nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it's really irritating",
        "This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn't even understand how the game works. Always saying \"connection is slow\" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there."

However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.",
        "Such a great and fun game but you can't do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.",
        "I like the game, it helps pass time. My only complaint is you make it super hard to do anything without having tonso3ns real money. Which is ridiculous. I get that you need to make money off of this, but don't be so ridiculous about it.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Not spent a penny on it yet and managing alright to do tasks etc in a reasonable time. Though I've not completed a quest yet but that could be me not getting back to the game regularly enough. That's my issue though.",
        "The idea of this game is fun, but the actual game play can be a little monotonous. Almost impossible to advance without spending money.  For all the time and effort you have to put into it, there should be a bigger pay off.",
        "It's not my favourite game because resources take FOREVER to get. I cannot spend real money and its expensive to purchase the package. It's so difficult to get diamonds and other resources. Please make it easier to get the needed items for the events.  PLEASE  !"

Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don't bother as you won't get it",
        "I like the game but it is hard for players who can't buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.",
        "Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth's sun will die before you max out your hero's knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It's more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.",
        "Waste of time. I started playing the game as an offer to get points for another game. Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I'm promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won't play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.",
        "Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it's worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!",
        "Too late to join this game. As soon as you lose your newbie protection you become a farm for higher level players, preventing you from progressing. Every morning you find all your resources pillaged and your troops dead or incapacitated. Maybe I'm just in the wrong timezone."

You can pay 2 bucks to remove the ads, but isn't necessarily going to make the experience better.  The ads are short, for the most part, but still can get annoying if you've played 10 puzzles in a row.  And considering you can complete a puzzle under or around the 2 min mark, those ads add up.  Worth a dl if you enjoy this type of game.",

I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",

        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.",

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren't available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you'll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I've made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you've to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",
        "THIS GAME IS THE WORST!!! Save yourself some time and DON'T install this thing I can barely move the car so please make easier to control. I know your trying but I,m sorry I,m uninstalling this game.",
        "It's stupid. It's really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn't turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked."

        "Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D",
        "Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I'm sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.",
        "Brilliant! It is absolutely fantastic! Bit of lag and ads but apart from that it's perfect. Also it's very different from the other dumb ways to day which goes to show how much effort the creator(s) put into making them.They didn't just quickly make a few quick games for the money. No. They put effort. It is amazing. The deaths are funny and the characters are cute and so is the art style. Creator, GREAT JOB!!!",
        "The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.",
        "Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that's all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS",
        "To be honest, I don't think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it's not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that's for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed"

When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "I don't understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed."

My only gripe is that the squares or hexes are too small so it is very hard to navigate the puzzle without breaking previous connections. My other issue is that at times connections randomly disconnect. Fixing these issues would make the game more relaxing",
        "I hink this game is great! It is fun and super addictive and has helped me through boredom. The only problem I have with this game is the tangram graphics as it tends to bug quite a bit. Overall I think the game is amazing and I hope to see more stunning content!",
        "Love how many different types of games there is to play very addictive and if you get board playing one game you just pick a different one. It's great for those who don't sleep very well like myself. The only fault is there is far too many adds please get rid of them 😊",
        "Absolutely love this app. Its a great way to pass the time and the fact that it has multiple puzzles all in one is fantastic, since my attention span wavers. This keeps me constantly bouncing around to different challenges so its hard to get bored. ❤",
        "Way too many ads! The puzzle content is fun, but the \"new\" games you unlock are just variations of the first ones you get. The amount of ads make the game play really annoying.",
        "I find all these puzzles are fairly easy.  I played every game.  Master skill and managed to beat all 50 all games. This app makes you feel smart. Its so easy that it's a good game to play when you need to multi task while watching tv. I went public and noticed there have been hundreds of others already mastered this app as well."

THE SPRINT BUTTON HAS A FORWARD FUNCTION THAT SUPPOSED TO BE NOT. THE ANALOG CONTROLS SEEMS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE AND UNCONTROLLABLE WHEN THE GUARD STARTS TO NOTICE YOU. THE GAME ALSO PAUSE FOR A MILISECOND WHILE YOU ARE IN THE GAME CHASING BY GUARDS IF YOU HAVE UNLOCK SOME ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH IS SO ANNOYING... BETTER UPDATE/UPGRADE THIS GAME OR ELSE I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. ITS SO ANNOYING AND NOT ENTERTAINING AT ALL...",

        "The new update is really bad. It makes the screen smaller and therefore harder to control. I'm not able to complete even a single level after this update. Dissapointed!!",
        "Whoever thought a new update making the controls and view so much smaller should be fired.  Annoying controls IS NOT the way to make a game harder.  Obviously did not think it though.  Played game up til now, wont now.",

It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!",

        "If you've liked the first game you're probably gonna enjoy this one. It's more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it's built around microtransactions so if you're feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don't understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it's likely you're going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.",
        "Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren't aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don't expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!",
        "I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!",
        "Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I'm done, and become impossible. I'd love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It's a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it's a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.",
        "Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I'm stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!",
        "Ok its annoying and frustrating if you accidentally press a power up button and waste your zombie coins can you add like a thing lile when you press the power up button down below there would like something pop up like \"Are you sure your gonna use this power up?\" \"Yes or no\" to lessen accidents :("

It's not an effective strategy...and no parent would download another budge game after seeing one ad a minute.",
        "\"drag and drop the broken bits into the right place\" game locks up and little 4 year old girl cries. Now I know why these games get hacked by little sisters older brother. People get pissed. Enjoy your money budge!",
        "My kid loved this game. She got really into it and was loving every moment, but then a part of the game wouldnt let her do anything. It was a boss scene on a pinkie pie level and a drop and drag boss on a rarity level. The game simply wont do anything and hence she cant get any farther. This is frustrating as i paid for all the stuff for it as she enjoyed it so much and its beginning to feel like i paid for my kid to be sad. Please fix!",
        "Let's talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that's how money is made, but that's ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.",
        "AMAZING Now don't blame me for loving this, I know there is not many levels, too many ads, but this is very active for kids. It can make thier reflex better! Can season 2 just come out already?",
        "Don't buy anything in the app cuz it doesn't sinc with other devices and when you complain NO ONE responds back! This app won't get another penny from me cuz you're a rip off! And if it wasn't for my granddaughter liking ponies, I'd delete the app all together! Seriously crappy customers Service!!!"

        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "So, this is an awesome, addictive and fun, satisfying game to play and it is really good if you want to become a nail artist. I would of gave it five stars but it is a bit unreal like you can just rub the nail varnish everywhere but it only appears on the nail but that can stop you from being annoyed because it is not as hard as it is in real life and one of my designs didn't go into my album because the game just got stuck and randomly stopped by its self and it went back to my home screen. Also there is too many ads. I am not interested! And you can't cross them off unless you download the app! What point is that?! And I cannot move and make the stickers bigger on match this so I can't complete it. Help! Sort this out!",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊"

        "This is a great game... You should play it if you like gymnastics and if you are board,You   should download this game... Is very fun... I liked it... But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!",
        "I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the 'X' button it shouldn't show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!",
        "This is from my daughter, \"I like the game but there's some things about it I kind of don't understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she's practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot.\"   This is from me, \"the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it's fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall.\"",
        "The main thing I didn't like about it is how little things you can do unless you spend like 10 bucks especially seeing as this is a game that looks like it's targeted towards children $10 is pretty expensive just to be able to play a gymnastics",
        "It's a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don't take it seriously! I'm not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that's just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!",
        "I love the game,but I don't know how to take off the tights or skirts if I don't want them on. The reason I downloaded this app is because I started gymnastics class and I love it and every time after school I get on my phone and play this game and  it makes me want to go to the gym."

It doesn't resister some of the moves you make or it's lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can't see what's coming next. Just stop cheating! Don't take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.",
        "I have a Xiaomi Redmi 4 mobile with 3 GB RAM, 1.4 GHz Octa Core. Still Game hangs, Speed enhanced with a jerk every time and then it dies. I have reset my mobile and reinstalled it but the problem still there. It's very annoying. Otherwise I love this game. It's very addictive.",
        "I love this kind of games, but this is the most incredible game i've ever played. I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E !!! I don't know & and l don't care what are u think about this game. I'm sure it's perfect for everyone. Any where, any time. I don't know why, but when l play this game l feel like l am the boss who commands to that minion who runs. I see that wonderful worlds and l feel like l'm doing all that job. When I was a little bit small, l was playing this game with my sister and the minion was ower slave. This game is very funny and, like Janise Palmer said, now l realize that l made a huge mistake. I have instaled it back and it's ok. I'm level 10 now.",
        "The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I've reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn't sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall",
        "Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won't do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.",
        "This game is awesome and funny I guess. I'm trying to think of something to complain about (I love complaining) but I can't!! Oh wait........... You could make things like characters and stuff less expensive. It's  Ike....I go on SHOP and it says stuff like (random minion) 1234 tokens!!  Dats 2many bro!"

        "Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren't enough. And one of them didn't work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.",
        "I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.",
        "It's fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I'm bored. I love the songs and dance moves it's awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it's awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don't know how to dance then you should download this game it's perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.",
        "It's a good game overall but the songs that are supposedly meant to be free aren't. I would rate it 5 stars but I can on play 3 songs every 24 hours. I'm trying to workout while doing this but a workout isn't a very good workout if it's only for 6 minutes. Please give us a higher coin  limit and cut the wait time down some. Then and only then will I rate it 5 stars.",
        "Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn't have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!",
        "I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn't make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun."

        "I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it's working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don't like my non-responsive faction members and I'm worried once I leave my faction I couldn't join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.",
        "Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It's a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can't pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it'll be easier to level up characters. But it's pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.",
        "This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn't make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!",
        "No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can't remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I've provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted",
        "Great game! But error code 11 has locked me out of it. Cant get past the loading screen. More than a week now. The customer support email advised i check in game announcements for an update ....... i cant get in game so how can i check?!? I am missing events rewards. Probley removed from my guild. Money and time wasted. Not pleased",
        "Fun and addictive game. New features are added to keep it from getting boring. They do a good job of listening to players opinions when and if something needs changed. I would give 5* but nothing is perfect. Hands down the best TWD game out there."

I enter the details, it tells me that I've already logged in, I go back to the game and it just does the same thing over and over..... Anyone know how to solve this issue? Website is no use at all",
        "Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.",
        "Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products.",
        "This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!",
        "This latest update keeps freezing up. I have to close it out completely and restart it. I lose any powerups I was using when it freezes, too. I cannot even finish playing the mighty levels the last few days because of this issue. Very annoyed.",
        "This is nolstaga.  I totally  love this game and rovio keep on doing what you are doing wow this new profile is kinda trippy.  Aslo my boys wow yall changed the name and an added classic.  Hmm good wow y'all changed the layout and the amount of stars it really never bothered me  that Much.  But thanks anyway.  Anyway I earned the badge that said pop me/them.  Then I played a level I noticed that      rip.     the pig said pop them.  I was like WHATTTTTT I wondered what they used to say.  I thought it was something thing like Omelet it sounded like it.  Which would be totally Fugded up cuz you know the Eggs.  When I  imagine them saying pop them its kinda creepy and scary and weird. Anyway thanks rovio I totally love this Franchise/series."

Download only if you're willing to drop a fortune.",

        "Some people use this for a dating app or say innapropiate things and kids play this game obviously. But that isnt the games fault its the players fault. However i would like it if the creators would sensor all of that",

        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing",
        "I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !",
        "Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There's been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5",
        "Game is really good. Best drift game I've ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn't finish the race and it gives the \"wrong way\" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this."

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn't respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn't know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn't be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",
        "The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don't close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.",
        "Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration."

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",
        "This is really hard. I can't buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible",
        "This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control's are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars",
        "When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although…                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads…ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It’s still great!"

There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",

The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",
        "This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don't play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don't make us wait foreverrrr!",
        "It's a fun game and I'm enjoying it. However, I've come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.",
        "Fun time waster, can get quite a lot sunk into it, and get e erything without paying up. Glad its always been grindable. Just has had trouble connecting for saves. I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They're here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!",

Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game"

Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",

        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",

        "Amazing app! My sister broke my old piano 2 years ago and I gave up. When I started thinking that I need to start again in my piano career, I started looking for piano apps that I could play my own music. Unfortunately, a lot of the apps didn't work for me until I came across this one. Just to say thanks for making this great app. :)",
        "This, after 6 years of playing piano has narrowed all my work down to half the size.. I've been a musical genius, and then tragedy struck, and I lost my ability completely half my life... wasted. But this app helped me to relearn how to play. Thank you. Thank you immensely",
        "Fun to noodle around on, but significant delay when using Bluetooth speakers or headphone (since I haven't this issue with other apps I can only surmise it is exclusive to this app) which isn't great considering wireless audio is quickly becoming the standard.",
        "This app is so good! I've never had a piano and wanted to learn but couldn't but I started writing my own songs on this app and it's so good. The graphics are like a real piano and I love the magic tiles and everything about this app!!! ❤❤❤",
        "Its a good app, has many sounds, keyboard is easy to use. All thats missing is a built in metronome to keep tempo",

        "The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I've purchased don't work it gives a message saying they couldn't find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT",
        "I have been playing for a year now and I'm still in love with Design Home! True, it's hard not to spend extra money but I do believe that the makers have formed a game that can be enjoyable by those with money to spend to have fun but, also have developed a game with really beautiful items that one can buy very inexpensively, and even pieces that are in between. You can't get more thoughtful than that!",
        "I love this game!! \"it helps a lot\" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I'm buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))",
        "I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.",
        "Entertaining. It's easy to spend a lot of the free money and diamonds on design, then you may have to wait a while to advance if you want to play free. It's clear there is no switch up on the top players, so when you go into competition, it's all about how much money you have to spend. Even when the rooms have a theme, people tend to vote for their taste, vs. if the request stated i.e. Mid-century mod, or traditional. Addictive unfortunately.",
        "Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion."

Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I've ever played",
        "AWESOME man I love the game man best graphics ever! Insane gameplay I love it . I already know that Gameloft will give best graphical experience ever but the game is frikkin good .but the recent update have a slight problem. It is the details of objects takes time to form fully. But the race is done before it . Please fix this problem.",
        "You have to change the controls to tap left and right to turn. And change the sensitivity to 100%. Once that is done th controls are good.   Good game, it would have been nice to be able to play against your friends over the internet also, not just wi fi. It needs rewards in local wi fi also.. S class class cars turn with 1 second delay, which is very frustrating",
        "Best racing game on Android for me. But It we have to buy credits it the most difficult process. It will be a game-changer and very good turn if We Can sale maxed out cars which we have and get credits in Return. I guess this feature will be awesome. Love this Game",
        "I've just realized that this game is for people that have gambling addiction trates, people who will keep spending money to advance.  I got a offer to buy a car in the game, limited time offer it said only 10,000 tokens, so I looked up how much that was out of curiosity? $149! Are you for real? Someone must be on drugs to come up with these prices. I just feel sad for the ones that do pay for these so called offers. May Gameloft be cursed until you take away your greed.",
        "Why am I forced to download 1.5 gb data for this game daily?? Getting fed up man! Everyday I am downloading and the next day it asks again. Its seriously frustrating. Kindly give all updates in one download pls."

        "I kind of miss the old version because isn't that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "OMG BEST GAME EVERRR IT HAS SO MANY NEW GAMES IN IT & A SPECIAL VALENTINE'S ADDITION! U CAN EVEN CREATE YOUR OWN DUMB WAY TO DIE CHARACTER!!!! PLEASE DOWNLOAD DONT MISS OUT! And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won't have a problem with the ads cause they don't show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don't think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it's a grate game and it's a laugh and a joke, I think it's a really good game☺",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long."

        "I love this game, i've been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You",
        "I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can't get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I'm sorry I wasn't clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can't stop playing. And I'm SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)",
        "I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can't see or control what I'm doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.",
        "Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it's trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.",
        "Very addictive game.  Next version here are some thoughts:  show some flames on re-entry.  Docking clamps so you can put fuel into orbit and pickup additional fuel so you can go to Venus and return to earth.  Put the rest of the planet's in there.  Make it so you can take cargo such as rocket parts to moons and other so you can build a rocket there that can go further due to low gravity at launch.  I really liked this game and a lot could be done with it.",
        "Excellent game, very addictive Would be great if larger rockets could be built though. Also maybe someway of allowing multiple components to be linked to command buttons (i.e) 1 button that could be assigned to all stage 1 separators so they all detatch at once, then another button to ignite all stage 2 rockets, and another button which could be linked to multiple parachutes so they all deploy at once rather than ending up in a crazy spin"

Now, my first thoughts about this game was that it was very good but as I have updated the game it has just been very slow and overturns when you tap. It also randomly takes you to the play store without tapping on an ad.",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",

        "A lot of frame rate issues. Lost many runs because controls become unresponsive while gameplay continued. Ads are incredible intrusive. That said, it can be really fun if they cleaned up the coding on this simple game."

        "I'm really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don't have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!",
        "This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don't really care either way I'll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I'd debating on installing it just get it. You'll have fun, trust me.",
        "Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.",
        "Until the previous update, everything ran fine. But now, with the Cream update, the game lags a TON. I get frozen on one frame while everything's still happening. I start off in first, then the framerate drops to 0 temporarily while I'm bombarded with obstacles I can't see to do a thing about. Fix these performance issues and I'll put my rating back to 5 stars.",
        "To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I'd like. You can't at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I'd like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn't taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it's worth the $1.99 purchase I made.",
        "This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don't think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it's free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future."

Best game I've come across in a WHILE.",
        "Fantastic mobile game. It's a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn't seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can't move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it's an indie-developed game, I understand it's tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I'm hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!",

Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don't pay attention ^^",

I love it so much I'm taking my sweet time collecting all the tribes. And the graphics is just fitting for the gameplay, everything about the game is just peachy. Totally recommended.",

The 'modes' list is a little sparse, however, and it would be great if you would plan some modes as a side project or something. Not that it is easy making a new mode. Well nonetheless, god job",
        "Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a \"Poytopia has stopped\" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session."

        "Now these days, to be powerful is cards. And it's really sad to see it in one of my favorite fighting game. I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it's still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I'm going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.",
        "I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn't too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can't sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?",
        "Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn't going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range",
        "The game is a lot of fun but there's one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it's kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I'd give it 10 stars",
        "Amazing graphics,  smooth gameplay.  But the biggest problem is upgrading,  why the hell does a common chest need 3 hrs to open?  Do you want us to keep playing or play only around 5 times the whole day?  And only four slots for chests and then 3 hrs to open?",
        "I've been playing this game for a while now off and on again and I realized some things about the \"online\" features. First off, no online game can be paused. In a \"multiplayer\" match u can clearly pause the game if u feel the call of nature, or ur mom is telling u to take the trash out, but U CAN'T PAUSE REAL PEOPLE!!! It doesn't work. Their online matchmaking duels are fake, and I am starting to be very irritated with the game developers."

        "I like the game but there is a bug in it.. i have 420 diamonds and i went to the store and there was a button to get 45 more and watch the video so i did and nothing happens. Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that's not fair....",
        "Found a game called \"Infinite Balls\" on my friend's iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it's not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.",
        "Super fun and addicting, the beginning levels are pretty easy but they get to be rather challenging after a while!  The only thing I don't like is the frequency of the ads.  Game itself is great though.",
        "Poor controls, continuous adverts, and blocky poorly created graphics.  This is one of the worst versions of this type of game I have played, there are other better versions out there.",
        "Good game.  Wish I could purchase ad- free version.  Deleted! I turn volume off for a reason, but then volume is forced in ads, which makes turning volume off option pointless.",
        "Very addicting game. I find it both relaxing and frustrating. That is only because I choose not to move on until I get all three stars. Oh but how satisfying when I do. I very highly recommend this game."

The game is like vice city that's good but in vice city their will be boats bit in this game their is no boat, air port , bus ,trucks and people are always firing hero always and fight skills have to improve. The irritation thing is mainly adds when starting or completing the missions. U should remove adds and have to update the game play",
        "Your game is good but i want a bus and  bus stop and please increase the people in your city also show them in different fashion dress. The people should travel in that bus and our hero hijack it . I want to say more but till than make such changes  guys also bring sea vehicles thank you! .",
        "Funny It's funny and fun but doesn't quite make sense. He is a rope man....That's like making rope wear underwear and a cape then calling it ROPE HERO!More or less 3 is good for me. ALSO it always says ads if there are ads ppl adept that will ya!",
        "One of the best games I have played on Google play. Or rather it is the best games  Cons: 1. There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! 😎 😎 😎",
        "Actually i love GTA GAMES so i thaught it would be fun playing but its almost 3 weeks and i have completed all the mission.. And have nothing to do... So just uninstalling the game.... Waiting for more mission but could not find any so now uninstalling it... Ya it is quite a fun to play but quite difficult to handle the controls if ur new to this kind of game...",
        "It's fun but you should offer a paid version and Bluetooth controller support. If you did I'd buy it but since I doubt this will happen I'm uninstalling. Looks fun but too many ads and touch-screen controls for these games suck."

        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",

For example I will shoot a blue colour to burst the same colour and another colour shoots out. Can you fix this? It's frustrating. It's a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*",
        "Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.",

        "It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying \"Ready? Let's go!\" voice when the sound is on."

The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",

I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "I'd happily purchase this game but that doesn't seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I'll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!",
        "Too many ads. It's annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying \"Something went wrong, please try again later\" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it's a super addictive and fun game to play.",
        "Recent updates have made this guy unplayable. Now you have to wait  through a 24 second ad that keeps reoccurring.  Not fun for kids and worse for their parents. Kids loved it before these updates."

        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "Am I ever going to play this game?  All it does is download stuff Update:. Graphics are great, game play is ok, seems like I'm just hitting random parts of my screen.  Healing component is going to make me uninstall.  There's no area to practice to figure out what you're actually doing.",
        "Love that tekken is on the phone I was a master at it when I was younger no one could beat me with my combos and counters. The game play is good but having to heal at every opportunity is not. The fight should be about the fight not having to heal before going into the fight. If I could go into every fight with full health I would probably spend money on upgrades and fighters . It's good but not brilliant as tekken should be. It yous would like to hear what I have to say message me back because I love and loved tekken on the PS and Xbox one of my top 3. Games off all times. Keep up the good work but yous are not just there yet for me to spend money on it but overall it's good but not brilliant as it should be"

You actually can play without paying, you can watch ads to get tickets for example, I have 200 tickets even tho I haven't paid a cent. The only thing that I don't get is the new content community, it would've been great if we'd gotten some clarification on that, but oh well.",
        "Seems like a okay game. But every time I downloaded and installed it I had nothing but problems with my phone, Samsung Galaxy s5. I know the developers will say their game is not capable of causing problems with phone, but I tested it several times and it always came back to this game being the problem. But for the time I was able to use the game, it did seem like an okay game.",
        "USA! USA! far to many questions that are about the USA for the jobs. Please improve your question bank. I'll even help out if you want. Part from that the game is OK passes the time and learn a few new things along the way. I now know alot of US ambassadors.",
        "I'm So Sad! Once you get into the game and Really Like it! They trap you... You have to purchase \"money\" to travel to different cities. Not good. I'm uninstalling. ☹️",
        "I love the game lots of fun! The only thing is it keeps freezing up on me on some of the questions. I then have to restart it and I get penalized as if I didn't know that block of questions. Other than that it is a really fun game and I am enjoying it.",
        "Very heavily US questions based which isn't good for the millions of people that don't live in the states. It's especially insulting when you're in Sydney Australia and most of the questions for the careers relate to the US. Also, seriously lame that you now have to spend large amounts of bp tickets just to complete land marks. I'm going to uninstall."

I kinda felt like it was a lot shorter then the other games. But other then that I had fun playing it and I'm super excited for other to come out so hurryyy!!!!!!! Lol",
        "This is just like the other game you guys made, the one with the doctor in the hospital, down to the exact same thing of \"play the first couple of levels for free but if you like you pay\" I bet this one is for the same price. On a side note, the story is different but the game play is the same, go have a look if you want. I will say this is a good game and I take nothing away from the hard work you have done. Good looking graphics, good smooth game play. A game you can get into and do try the other games of this developers you may like it as well. Over all a good game I just do not think it is worth $15. But best of luck guys.",
        "I absolutely love this game. However I had to order a new phone due to mine being replaced for insurance purposes and I was logged into my Facebook and lost all my progress and the app is NOW wanting me to repay. I don't wanna have to pay another 9.99. If there's anyway I can get my game back.",
        "I've bought nearly most of these games and this one has disappointed me most. When I finish a level it won't actually finish so I have to keep restarting it. Also some of the bonus levels are hard to understand what I'm supposed to do. I don't know if it's a bug but it's kinda annoying. Apart from the bug, just like the Delicious games etc it's great. Just need to fix the bugs :)",
        "I would rate higher but it's says I haven't found any mice.  But I always find them twice each level and it says mouse found when I click on it.  It's frustrating.",
        "This refuses to let me log into Facebook and everytime I try to click on the camera to give to one of the agents it freezes and the character won't even walk over to the camera I love GameHouse games but this one is glitching so bad please fix it"

        "So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn't turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound \"once\" for all future ads. It's simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little \"card dance\" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!",
        "It's a fine enough game, I mean it's solitaire.  However the app refuses to allow Pandora to run in the background unfettered.  I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can't work my life, I can't work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.",
        "I love this app!  It helps kill time,  keeps your mind occupied and before you know it.  Waiting to see your Doctor seems a few minutes lol. Cons are wish there weren't too many ads. When the ads pop up, it kind of ruins the game. Other than that, great!!!",
        "Had an old version that was pretty fast and got used to it. This in comparison is kinda slow, like real cards! I will get used to it. Otherwise, really like this solitaire game. Picked it over several others.",
        "I agree with other comments the ads are awful I've tried several of these type games and all are to much ads .. But this one i seem to have higher scores than with the other ones.. It's a great pass time and over all a better choice",
        "Way too many ads.....way too many ads.  It drives me crazy!  Also I noticed sound(commercials) coming from the scene as I'm playing and even after I stop playing to hear it, again it came from the scene.  This has happened twice in the last few weeks. I took it to my local Verizon store, but they couldn't figure it out.  HELP!!!!"

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",

Bad I can,t see his face any more road pups also look good  but hank is 😫😫😫 when he is in level 1 to 14 at that time he looks normal but at 15 😫😫😫 all other games. Talking games are good but hank is not 😫😫 please let hank good not like a road dog please .😫😫😫😫"

I don't get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining.

Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out.

This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.",
        "I one stared it because it has good graphics and what not but the only problem is this is a complete knock off of \"Asphalt 8\" features and everything. I'd say it's so much alike I'd call it plagiarizing but that's just my opinion.  Good game overall but no respect for not being something differebt in a better way ."

Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn't explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.",
        "You have hackers playing this game. I just played a game against a guy who ballons kept passing all his towers but no points came out of his health. I rember why I delted this game in first place. I could have a ton of gallons go thru people's line and they not lose health.",
        "It's a great time killer but the kidnapper card for cardbattles needs to be removed. Their is also way too many pop up adds that you can't skip. One after each game is stupid.",
        "It's a fun game, great for passing the time. That being said it suffers some very problematic connection issues, if I tab away for even half a second it disconnects me and causes and auto loss",
        "I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you're connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I've lost loads of battle's that where going really well then lose connection and it won't reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads."

Some item descriptions aren't in English, and the text after you gain things in combat for gold and souls goes too fast. Still don't know what it's saying.   Would recommend though just for a quick thing to do when you're bored and have time to kill.",

        "A surprising find, i really don't expected this game to have this level of quality. This game successfully give me the feeling of discovery and exploration while in expeditions, and i feel compelled to build and better the manor. But a disappointment is how there are no differences between characters other than their classes and aesthetics.",
        "This game is great takes a little wile to figure out but it is no way a pay to play you have the option to buy gems that help u acheive things faster. Its not much of a grind either to acheive things that are less common with that said the classes are somewhat confusing finding the correct skill set and play style can be hard",
        "What a surprising good game, somehow it manages to keep me up logging at it daily to train my heroes and do some quest, a thing that would be really amazing would be cloud support, so you can play the same savefile on two devices, didnt found any game breaking bugs and so far the game didnt pushed the shop into me which was nice. All in all a 4.5 out of 5. Can t wait to see this game evolve and age.",

        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "lnstaII 'VEARN' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",
        "Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s"

        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn't find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

        "To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.",
        "Used to be so much better. Cameras are now not fluid, it doesn't show the hole prior to shot anymore. Truthfully, it was awesome before you made changes... It goes back to the old saying, \"why fix it if it isn't broken?\"",
        "Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I've been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!",
        "Awful controls, heavily focused on buying coins & watching ads just to play matches. Not recommended!",
        "This game is good. You should try to make it a lot more like golf with friends (the Steam game). Try to make the graphics look more detailed and better. Add more maps too.",
        "Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn't as fun and realistic as I had hoped."

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",
        "Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It's Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I'm Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!",
        "Good game and all but the pictures shown for the view isn't what it seems, and this game has some flaws, such as inaccurate hitmarkers. When an enemy shoots from behind me, for some reason, it points to the front, I almost died one time, pressed medkits, I got back up, and I couldn't turn the camera for the rest of the game. Also, add the guns that are actually in the pictures... :/",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout"

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that's what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.",
        "Everyone I know plays Cookie Clicker (CC), definitely too much. I absolutely refuse to play Cookie Clicker myself. I am not one to compete over single-player games, so I was looking for something similar, a game that none of my friends play. AdVenture Capitalist (AVC) fit the profile and is a simplified version of CC. I'm not saying that AVC is more rewarding than CC, but it isn't nearly as convoluted. It's a simple game for those of us who want to minimize our time spent on phone games.",
        "This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It's main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.",
        "I really like this game. its really fun. so i figured  i should tell you that all you have to do is change your date and time and the game doesn't know. Like i change it to the year 2036 and i get all of those years of profit in secs and then my phone fixes the date its self and i can do it again. I've restarted twice cause i felt bad for cheating lol. Well hope you can make it were we can't do that anymore."

        "This game is a game I can proudly say I will never delete. I hadn't played this game for very long but I have loved it so much. The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It's never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.",
        "It was very fun testing the early access! And the thing that i noticed was the new token system. Im not saying the token system was bad, but i liked the older system better. On how there were bronze, silver, and gold stars, and the star depended how good the item was. I was wondering why you changed it. благодаря!",
        "This game has been amazing since early-access. I  have loved it for a long time and will still love it for a long time. One suggestion though. It would be cool if one could emote inside the van once you have got away or have been arrested",
        "Excellent game. Highly replayable. Fun and challenging. My only issue is that emotes switch from one side to the other when playing as a thief vs playing as a sniper. Plus, having to hit a button to fire vs just hitting the right side of the screen is a bit more difficult. Otherwise, almost perfect game.",
        "WARNING: YOU WILL BE HOOKED AS SOON AS YOU START THE GAME. The game is really cool, I love the gadgets, the replayability, variety of maps, and how this could be free to play. Even though there are alot of glitches, these improvements will make up for them",
        "It's really fun, has some great mechanics that aren't very common among mobile games, and it is simple to play. But there is one problem I have, which takes place as theif. Sometimes, as I am about to duck down behind cover, there is a short time frame where the sniper is able to hit you even though you are behind the cover. This is for the full covers, not the breakable or the half. They can also sometimes hit you when you are at the full covers, which I hate. The only time I get mad when I die in this game is when the sniper is able to shoot me while I am in full cover or within that short time frame."

        "Can one also be able yo take turns??  I dont like it straight all the way to nowere. And brake should be fully efective one should STOP anytime he wants and also dont sale cars it should just be affordable by coins  Its really a gr8 game but only a little more work.",
        "Ok..but needs work No challenge n no real upgrade kinda wasting my time. And what's up with this buying the last car, there's no horn and way to keep the player interested that is why give it only three stars now if you fix it maybe I'll give give stars😶😴😴😴",
        "Spin my ride No more speed, I'm almost there! Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care. Last car to pass, here I go! As the line of cars are going so slow! 5 star rad! Gotta get back to the game, all. See ya....Speed thrills!",
        "The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .",
        "Basic. You have to over take cars... That's it. When they talk about the physics being like simulation they are lieing. Left right go stop. Poor 16bit sound that you will want to turn off. It's like a game from the 80s. Uninstall.",
        "Incredibly boring gameplay with absolutely no objective. I got bored within minutes after realising that there's nothing to do. No improvements on the first version. Why not add a chase element or even timed checkpoints... anything even?!"

        "The game is okay it has a lot of faults. The matching system is horrible it always puts me against people that are hundreds of levels higher than me. And somehow their money regenerate quicker and they're able to send  out more and bigger and better units out on the battlefield. Even when the matchmaking system puts me against somebody my own level their money regenerates quicker than mine and they send out a lot more units faster than I can for whatever reason. Uninstalling this game",
        "I absolutely love this game! As a person who enjoys strategy games, from RTS such as Stronghold, Supreme Commander, and C&C, this game takes my top 3 for the phone. The match making system is very good at keeping same skilled players together, as well as it isn't very much a pay to win game. The units are decently balanced and the game isn't to slow or fast. Definitely a game I will keep playing for a long time. I do want to ask, if you guys will be putting in a \"survival mode\", and withstand against waves of enemies. Great job FourThirtyThree",
        "I'll update whenever I can actually play the game. It's up to date. I get to the screen that asks if I'd like to use my Google account or Facebook account. I do not have a Facebook. Obviously I have a Google account. I'm writing this review. I click Google and both options disappear. It sets at that screen where the two options were previously available and nothing happens. I made sure to wait around 5 mins to see if it was a loading issue.. dunno. I'd love to try out the game.",
        "really good game i love it but just some ideas that might make it even better (I think the menu on the left side could have a higher contrast (text and background)or I think the trophy chest amount could be adjusted to the player amount in the clan +to participate in trophy chest you have to be in the clan since it started (midnight)please do some balance changes soon... some untis don't feel to be used enough or some just are OP like the steel saw mech or another idea :to have some way to delete (locked) chests )please reply if you (4:33)see it and want to give a statement",
        "Its a good game, i like this kind of games and i love when i play with friends too! The game its really easy to play, a strategy game and simply as destroy the enemy base... Love it! Its true that not all are going to like this but for me this game its 5 stars. Btw i have started the game and i said i love to play with friends, does this game has a Couple/Duo match to play with them (Not versus them). Thanks in advice, keep staying great!!",
        "This game is awesome, it reminds me of Guns Up! . The ONLY thing I don't like about it is it's basically pay to win. I only have 5 slots to open chests and it cost gems to open the chest and money to get gems. Other than that, the gameplay is solid. It's very unique in it's actually a wonderfully crafted game and not some thrown together garbage. I probably will end up throwing money at it only because it's made so we'll. But like I said I do feel the process for opening chests is a bit too cash hungry..."

It looks that they are not having further challanges  but  not agree to accept",

        "I'm about ready to give up on this.  The 'laser' balls introduced around level 1260 are both unplayable and completely pointless. The game is all about popping bubbles, well... it was until this point.   I was hoping to push through to the final levels but as long as these are in the game I really can't be bothered.   Honestly, when I have to guess the best time to launch balls based on totally random evidence... and lose when those balls are gobbled up for reasons I cannot fathom...  Following on... I've reached level 2082 and cannot possibly see how to  get further than about half way through with the balls provided!  I guess if I stick at it for a month or so I might be able to accumulate enough bonus balls to have a chance!  And there I was thinking that 2076 was tough!     And I **still** hate the laser balls!   Been playing for a year now... on the free version... you guys must have earned a motza from all the adverts that I've displayed!!  Update - I think I've found a bug in level 2215 - whenever I launch a ball it is immediately invisible and doesn't seem to have any effect on the balls it's aimed at. Randomly a ball will cause others to drop... sometimes invisible ones will appear as they drop.  I've rebooted the phone... problem still here.",

        "Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.",
        "Good game however, once you've taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world's and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.",
        "Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.",
        "It's a really great game! I'm really looking forward to an update. I think it'd be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I'm looking forward to see what you guys do!",
        "This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.",
        "Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can't hit a single shot so I have to restart the game."

        "I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",
        "I love this app! It's sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it's a fantastic app!",
        "I love this game but i don't like the characters tho .but it's fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don't know so that's why they don't like it . It's good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it",
        "It's a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it's really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars",
        "I love it but... I can't draw that good so it's good😀😁😃😄😆😉😊😋😍😘😗😙😚☺️🙂🤗😝😜😛🤑"

        "I have only had this game for a few days, so I can't write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it's up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.",
        "Most awesome wolf simulator game I have ever played! The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the controls are pretty good. Although getting attacked by several animals at once when you only go for one makes completing missions pretty hard. And you should be able to run from a fight if you're losing, instead of having animals come at you until you're dead. All in all a great game play experience though. I love it!",
        "Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there's a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)",
        "Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you've made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD",
        "Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don't think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.",
        "It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won't work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don't mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!"

I just wish there was a difficulty setting so you start off with easier games and then it could get harder as it progresses, because at the moment I can't pass 70% of the levels without using hints.",

        "I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it's the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.",
        "I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",
        "I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.",
        "I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you'll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha",
        "I was confident to delete the app from my phone cos it says that the game will be saved on my fb acc. But only the highest score remained and the potion got back to 1. I was already at 56! Deym! Ayusin nyo buhay nyo! Sayang effort ko! Aba!"

        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it's class.",
        "Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It's very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again",
        "I love this game but I want to tell you. You Simcity global HQ building have a problem . And I think all through the world of simcity player face this problem . Your global HQ trade only  View u wanted things like if I want Cement than I searched one HQ building than HQ bulid view me More  And more same thing like burger and sugar and franch FRi and etc things  And few other things like glass and etc I want that the HQ building show one type. Of things like if cement 1 and 2 glass 3 matel 4 cap etc etc than like I want so sir please 😅 try",
        "Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy."

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",

Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",

The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",

        "I LOVE it! It's a great time killer, relaxing, challenging, and really fun to play! I don't know why people are complaining about the ads. There really aren't a lot of them and they aren't too annoying. I love the game!",
        "It was cool for the first few levels. Every couple of levels you would get a pop up ad but the higher you get in the levels the ads start coming in the middle of the level and they pop up like every 10 seconds.  It's ridiculous.",
        "Since the update on the game I can not get the ads to go away. You have to completely exit the game then go back into it in order to go to the next level. Little frustrating, aside from that I really enjoy the game itself."

Not sure if it's a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it's because I completed challenges but I don't appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don't feel evenly matched :(",

        "Players are bailing from this game like crazy. My clan has lost nearly all the higher level players, most from leaving the game. So the clan is all low level players who can't contribute as much. Arena player's list shows everyone but the top 3 not playing all week. A ton of other issues that you can find in any ABE forum and even in the comments on posts on the ABE Facebook page. I think Rovio's stock trend shows it all.",
        "This use to be my favorite game. Have spent alot of money playing. Due to the \"white out\" have not been able to play for 3 months. Even after several updates, nothing. Tech support claims to be on the issue... Very frustrating!!!!",
        "I used to love this game, but the changes make me HATE it now. Like it's so hard to get a premium hatch ticket now, yet y'all still throw two star and three star Birds in there. The Halloween event is impossible with the numbers set so high, and the amount of skulls you receive in a battle is 5-10 max. This game has become a money pit, and I think I'm out. Rovio got greedy, and I don't appreciate it. You ruined the game for sure",
        "OK. So, it started off fun. But, now all I get is lost connection, slow connection or some other BS! I'm not going to be able to get any further because I won't pay for stuff. So, it's going to be uninstalled. Of you must, play for a week, then ditch it",
        "The game keeps closing during play causing player's to loose prizes and money. It's having more problems with every update. Support staff are pretty useless when reporting glitches.",
        "More or less meh, can do with or without. Asks frequently if you enjoy the app, if you say \"no\" then that's it. However, only if you say \"yes\" will it ask you to rate it. Pathetic that the developers don't actually want feedback. Needs some smoothing out on a few things, but Rovio doesn't care."

        "It's like Episode's ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it's 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don't have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn't prone to crashing like this one.",
        "The stories are addicting and exciting. But you make us watch several ads and THEN ask us to pay for EVERY THING extra. From clothes to hair to what to say next to new chapters. I get the world revolves around money but you are getting paid plenty with these big name ads. Let the game be more enjoyable and make it free or a set price from the start for the app. You lure people in and then ask for money if they want to continue. Nah, I'll wait an hour for the ticket. Great game concept though.",
        "I've only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn't bad. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You're able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! However, at the moment, it isn't working for me. No matter how many times I try to speed up the clock, it isn't budging. It was working 2 hrs ago. So, IDK if there is a daily limit or what, because I didn't get a warning. There is something about the videos I don't like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!",
        "So addictive I couldn't stop playing it. Only thing I will say is you need to get to many diamonds for the clothes and some of the decisions you have to make. X Is there any more books after Mona series study abroad ? As it did say to be continued",
        "I pay for the unlimited ticket and never got what I paid for. Customer service has been unhelpful. I have emailed them many times and have gotten nothing but surveys back. My issue has not been taken care of.",
        "I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I've used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I've recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The 'free' diamonds doesn't work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn't pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn't anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these...."

Overall good game business practices not so much.",

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, \"mass\" and magnetism... But it's really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can't... Because your \"pencil\" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don't get in your way as much as this one.",
        "It's an alrite game. Some people like this kind of puzzle, but I am not too fond of it. Being a freeware it has ads that can pop up before and after each puzzle... so prepared to be annoyed. Game has many solutions and offers hints(not before... you guessed it, watching an ad first) so you can atleast get through some of the harder levels. I'd say give this game a try until you get frustrated by the app, not because of hard puzzles but because of ads.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜"

        "Maybe the reason people think its boring. It's probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn't because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn't have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can't handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn't for you.",
        "The game controls are very annoying. The character won't go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",
        "These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I'm downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol",
        "This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn't make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I'm to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don't waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff",
        "It is awsome I love how on the last level (the black night) has two levels the black night and the vampire  the whole game is so fun I'm done the whole game still play it all the time  but it needs more levels love it so much  so it needs MORE LEVELS",
        "I would get to the title page and that was it. It won't let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix."

        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system.",
        "This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn't always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing",
        "I really like the game. But there's one thing that annoys me: when I don't play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars",
        "The best game on market right now. No ads, unless you request it for coins,(which I doubt you'll need to), many modes, including HELL(Infinite waves), MAP(To gain access to abilities and magic) and BATTLE(Normal wave advancement with bosses every 5 levels.). By far the best game that advertises it is not pay to play. Because it's not, despite the option to buy coins.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!"

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",

You could get around 40k cash for perfecting area 4 but now you recieve around 14 gold instead that will buy you around a 1k cash... its a joke dont waste your time unless your rich",

        "Great game both as a concept and its graphics. The only problem is the lack of energy. You only have energy for like 6-7 battles and then you have to wait or use gold. Make it at least 10 battles at low levels and keep increasing it."

        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "It's a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it's my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.",
        "I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I'm blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I'd request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players",
        "This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it's a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it's a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘",
        "It's pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It's hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it's a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There's multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don't recommend this game.",
        "This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match...."

        "Your dictionary needs updated!!! Does it only have 50 words in it? Because when I find extra words the game has no clue. Most important, the puzzles won't let you spell the word. I spelled candle 50 times, used all the hints and it spells cand,..it won't allow me to put in l, e. !! Because there is another pre-used letter between.  Game sucks due to these reasons.",
        "Great game, but when you want to leave it for a while it seems impossible to switch the damn thing off. Hello! If I can't use my phone it's a waste of time!",
        "Oh my gosh! I downloaded this game to test out for my mom who has suffered from a brain injury. The idea was to see if it was fun and interactive as well as giving her brain a bit of a work out/ stimulate recovery and memory. I found myself addicted to it so i downloaded it on my own phone too - even my step father is addicted ha! Its fabulous. I also recommend paying for the lowest package of 'hints' because all packages remove the adds (which are the only down side to this game. I paid 69p for 10 hints and it removed all the add - yay!)",

I like this game because you can do roleplay and I'm a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won't let me play it please fix that and reply",
        "Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.",
        "I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!",
        "I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin",
        "I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx",
        "This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up."

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",
        "Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I'm at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.",
        "Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",
        "I play this game in 2hrs and got stuck on level 42. It's challenge your mind. It's good for you, if you like doing brain games.. It helps you think about.. Like you really have to think about it or you will get stuck. But all the above, it's a awesome awesome game.",
        "Items don't move when they are supposed to therefore making it impossible to complete each task. It is very frustrating because the game would be more fun. It would make it more enjoyable with at least 1 or 2 hints."

Alot of tweaks are needed but I enjoy this game jus help us out the ones that like playing",

        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Great game. Really fun buy id love to be able to play without having to wait for someone to challenge me or vice versa. A single player option would be fun. Also i payed 3.69$ to have no ads but i sometimes still grt the very long ad videos which i find a little annoying since i payed for no ads... But other then that great game 😊",
        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills.",
        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!"

        "I freaking love this game but I do recommend more energy or at least less time to wait for energy. Please and thank you :)  P.S. We need more diamonds some how like. Maybe you should let us watch ads for 2-5 diamond's each ad. Or do a daily login type thing. I know you guys wont but I've been playing this game a ton and for a long time. i restart everything because when you guys make new stories it makes me want to use diamonds but I don't have anymore. I restarted the game like over 10 times honestly. Thanks for a great game though.",
        "I never thought I would find a game like this that would work so well and play so easily! The only things I would change would be adding videos to gain more gems, or getting 2 gems after each chapter. Maybe even some extra gems after finishing a story? Getting gems on previously finished stories as well. I would also add the option to replay a chapter from the menu, not only after playing the chapter. Other than that, THIS GAME IS A MUST PLAY!",
        "I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I've purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I'm really hooked on. Not to mention I've put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I'm limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It's just too expensive in the end.",
        "I love this app! I just wish you could collect more than 2 keys at a time. Sometimes the chapters feel short and to only be able to accumulate 2 keys feels like its not enough. 3 to 5 would be way better! Its already a bummer to not have enough diamonds to unlock cool stuff. (unless you want to pay more.. Not everyone has money to spend on phone app games)",
        "I actually really like this game. It's fun, it's time killing, all that good stuff. But the diamonds are what really kill it.  You get one free diamond at the end of every chapter, which would be nice if it didn't cost 25+ diamonds to make a choice. So to get all the options required to have a truly full game play experiance you must buy the diamonds, which also wouldn't be a problem if they didn't cost so much. (For 5 dollars you get 60 diamonds which is ruffly 2 choices and really they should be lasting longer then that.) There isn't even the option to watch an add for more diamonds. Buying them is the only choice if you want to have those certain experiances. I understand that the company has to make money, I really do, but charging out the ass for something is not the way to do it. In short, I would love this game if it didn't cost an arm and a leg to play.",
        "The gameplay is great but nearly all of the important choices cost. I am not opposed to paying to play a great game but the cost of this one is too high. Every chapter of every story has at least one important choice that will cost. The price for the choice is too high and there is no way to obtain free currency for the game. In order to shape a story the way you want to you have to spend a rediculous amount of real money to obtain game currency. A method of obtaining free currency and cheaper costs for choices needs to be implemented"

In our 10 years of creating story games together, we&#x2019;ve seen heartbreak, marriages, great adventures, and even Pixelbabies.<br><br>But even through diaper changes and late nights, we think we&#x2019;ve created our best work to date. We hope you&#x2019;ll fall in love with our newest characters, Chris, James, Kaitlyn, Dave, and Sam just as we have.<br><br>Enjoy,<br><br>- The Pixelberry Team",

        "Great game, no build waiting times, lots of strategy, a mix of tower defense and rts. Really is a game with a lot of effort put into it from non greedy devs. Well created hiker games. One small point that a future update could sort out is making a feature to create the same bandits again. Rather than manually going in and picking them again. And if you have spares, to automatically put them in place. Also duplicates seem to have no purpose as of yet....",
        "At first I got a clash of clan type vibe due to some mechanic like throphies and graphics. But the game is widely different and in a fresh new way. It's basically tower defense where you play both the defender and attacker roles which is done very well.",
        "Love mini games, also building tokens to obtain chests... please keep updates coming! And would love to zoom in more but I dig the overall quality of the game... when can I use my convoy to attack towns and castles?!?! Later on in the game?? Thanks!! And I would buy more gems if the price was reduced... fyi",
        "Simple fun time waster. Has enough different about it to set itself apart in the big mobile game industry. Gives a little strategy and also isn't a super money hungry game. I got some advanced units before it even offered to sell it to me for real money.",
        "This game is  great and is very addictive. The gameplay is smooth and battles are amazing. The only problem that I face is that it never matches me with people with same power in ambush mode.Most of the convoys are always powerful than me. Please do something on this issue",
        "The game is amazing ! No doubt , A note to the developers : You guys might not want to update the server so often , it's irritating! I click on a single troop, and server is being updated!? Sometimes it doesn't even happen successfully. So the screen keeps bugging me ! Except that , I can't point to any cons in the game, Fix that and I will give you guys 5 stars."

        "Love the game, BUT there's a glitch in chest bow where it locks up for 1 shot, multiple times a day. After you shoot without being able to aim, the bow works normal until the next jam. Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn't provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(",

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "What is this. I was on level 1 and i just got to the last checkpoint and when I had to land it crashed when it took so much effort into going through them checkpoints. I recommend you do not get this game unless you are good with airplanes and have experience (which I do but this game just ruined it). I shall see this development soon.",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active."

        "Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw \"pick 2\" vs. pick 3. I'm a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the \"typical pick 3 concept\"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper",
        "Not a clue if there's a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It's challenging but I've yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though \"buying lives\"",
        "This is a rip off of toy blast!  Peak Games went after hashbro MLP Puzzle party for ripping off the gameplay of toy blast by peak games. I am pissed off that they went after hashbro but not other knock offs. I liked MLP Puzzle Party this game is so boring. Not only they ripped off peak games they ripped off the music from Genies and Gems from Jam City. I will uninstall!",
        "I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back."

        "The is very fun because I have been playing since I was a kid and I still find it fun.  In the future sometimes instead of race can there a event where multiple players fight a power boss like dragon and the people are given prizes depending on there rank and they have to do a certain amount of damage to get the rewards instead of just letting them get it without trying",
        "Don't waste your time with this game. It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don't give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don't waste your time with this game.",
        "I'm hoping the update today fixes the glitches.  I got kicked out of a league match cause my device froze.  Never did that before til yesterdays update.  Please fix and I will give everything a five star",
        "This game is awesome, i rly like it a lot. But i see a problem in Arena battles since the latest update. Theres so many Heroic dragons and legendaries that are level 30+, and now they all use the right \"hits\" everytime, and when you don't have any \"good\" dragons, it is very hard to win. Previous battle system was rly good, when those dragons used random hits.",
        "I love this game.....i love getting New dragons that always look different than one another. I also love the graphics and the music.  But... why do you have to wait so long for food? This is basically the only game I play",

        "I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It's so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It's absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn't less if you don't. A high quality and fun game. I adore it",
        "As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It's not really fair for those who aren't of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there's a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.",
        "I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there's a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.",
        "In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I've played so far. Thank you makers!",
        "I've been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game."

        "I think this game is pretty cool! Also they added more houses to play in. I love multi-player because I like to see all the scores and I don't like the office because their's spiders and I hate spiders. I beat the Christmas level and I'm trying to beat the other levels too. But when you start the game, it says choose cat and press it and there's a skinny cat with the ears    down. I choose the kitten. But I LOVE the garden level because you go on the slides and you can go in the house and go out of it and go on the carousel and more! But on the picture when you download the game, the cat is in the washer and in the fridge. But you can't do that in the game. I tried too. Its boring at first but it's fun! I also don't know where the cats house is. Is it in the first house? I TOTALLY love it.😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😺😺😺😺😺😺😸😸😸😸😸😸😻😻",

(Crazy, right?!?!?!) and there are so many things to do. Plus it also reminds me of subway surfers..... The one thing I love besides the spa, is the restaurant. As far as I know, only fitness girl has that..... So definetly, it's a plus..... 👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍😋",

I dont know if anyone else has experienced what my 7yr old son has but on loading the game he was shown a flashing image of a man getting stabbed in the eye. This gqme has been removed and i have reported it to the video standards board that apply ratings on these games. Not sure how these things are even possible?",
        "Love all the Lego apps. They know Legos are awesome enough that playing with some digital versions is enough to promote buying the physical bricks. ~~~~ NO ADS - Just Fun! ~~~ Even the adults like this one. It's comparable to minions paradise but with all the waiting and advertising removed.",
        "I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it's very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.",

It is both good for Iphone and androisld users. The only thing bad about it was that your profile picture takes super long to load, so I gave up on that.",
        "I love this game, however recently I've been seeing a ton of video ads. It pops up everytime I go to choose my playlist. All these years playing this game and I've never had this issue before. It is very annoying",
        "Very fun.  I wish I could just do the Party games though.  They are much more fun as I prefer competing with a number of people, not just one.  Too hard to get enough tickets, though!  I get discouraged when no tickets/videos are available.",
        "Forced closed every five minutes in the middle of a game. Slowed my phone down. And made it extremely laggy and hot. Said I would put a bad review if it didn't stop. Here you go!",
        "I hate it, I thought it would be a perfect game for a music lover like me but it's not. The game just keep loading and loading ( both practice and Normal mod), i wastes 30 minutes for nothing, hope you guys could fix it as soon as possible. Tks.",
        "I'm a music lover and it's nice discovering genres I'm not into. It's very challenging knowing there are songs that I dont know and you have to really listen to its lyrics and the voice of the artist. So much fun."

        "I've found it very disappointing when  other user's connection is bad and their counter time takes forever while they're not even active. IMO if it happens twice they should be kicked. No one likes slow poker, especially when the player isn't even playing.  Other than that everything else is pretty awesome.",
        "Had trouble restarting sit and go. Returning to lobby and reentering addressed problem. Pretty good app. Challenges are obviously based on bankroll making it more of a player's game instead of a winner's game because poker is not a winner's game. Long play on shootout can be annoying but why you buying in at 2k? You get to play daily if you like to play for free and can even complete challenges when you went bust.",
        "Hands dont seem to be computer greedy to take your chips. Nor give higher level players generated wins with getting obvious flop or river cards giving them a win on a ridiculous hand they go all in on.",
        "I do think the games are rigged, how the hell do I loss over 100million chips in a 24hr span. Any time I played I couldn't win a hand, no matter how damn good my hand was, someone else would have an amazing hand. Something fishy man!",
        "today i have 1b and 500m. and then i play with my friend i get banned why ? because i dont do anything wrong and i love this game all the time. i get banned and i dont stop play but today. i will stop play this thank you zynga and also i buy alot of chips from zynga and u give me banned all the time thank you."

        "I really lived thus game because it isn't just tapping something but it's actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.",
        "Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.",
        "This brain definitely makes me feel like the front of my head is working. But the constant advertisements between every few levels is very annoying. Especially when a level takes 15 seconds and the ad runs the same length.  Would suggest the paid version if you like it."

        "Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It's the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I'm a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.",
        "Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn't get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn't give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5",
        "I'm trying to link my account to my other one by using my blizzard account that I already have. But it just makes me do the tutorial and after I completed it, it just keeps on doing the starter stuff. Even though I already have a blizzard account with my hearthstone rank 20, but it just restarts me back to ,25. I'm not sure its a glitche or I'm doing something wrong but It just wont let me log in my account.",
        "I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.",
        "What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can't win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!",
        "This game is about alright. Its very fun. Period.  But 2 major issues it's gonna face problems with is we can not add friends. Says friend request sent but no request found! Plus this game is very very Pay 2 Win! In the start its fun but than deck goes so unbalanced since money hungry creaters wouldn't allow good rewards for free! So kbviously knly the rich win? Ahh this sucks"

After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges."

        "Everything costs money. You'll be playing then run out of grenades. That'll be 30g. Don't have that? Well enjoy losing until you figure out a way to win. Love this game though. Made a purchase right off for a gun. Then I saw how much grinding is involved for the upgrades. The jump between a level 2 and 3 upgrade? Then the outfits, 2nd and 3rd weapons. Man. Sorry no thank you. This shooter however is very fun but the paywall is so well thought out I am not prepared to drop that kind of money. Learned my lesson losing 1k to Megopolis.",
        "I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn't have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn't get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren't vigilant of their customers and don't take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.",
        "I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It's perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven't had any problems with it. I can't wait for updates later on to come.",
        "Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn't allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!",
        "Great game to play, fun and exciting. But not F2P friendly. P2W guns will always be better and it's near impossible to get end games gear for F2P. But still bearable for F2P. My advice would be maintain F2P take it as a grindy F2P games and don't spend any money. It seems this game had an issue that you might not get the item you paid for. You will be charged and not receiving the item and when you try to contact the support. Oh boy... No body will be replying. It seems it's a trend here where there take your money and kick you out.",
        "Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area."

        "This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn't  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can't  exit,  overall  4.8!",
        "I love this game! As others have stated it's very addictive! It's also challenging when you get up in the amount of games you played. My only problem is that when you're asked to watch a video to collect points, the video stops playing and and you don't collect the points. This has happened to me 5 times in a row. Other than that, I do not know what people are talking about as far as a lot of ads. I don't find that at all.",
        "Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like 'cad.' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.",
        "The game isn't bad if you like word puzzles. My dislike comes from the fact that I have push notifications for this app turned off, but it somehow continues to manage to send them. It also keeps poor track of your coins. Good time killer.",
        "Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an \"Extra\" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that's only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.",
        "Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it's not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I'd give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won't be downloading any of your games after i delete this now."

        "Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can't earn gems from watching videos as it's never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Let me just say I don't mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high",
        "The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn't even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can't have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this",
        "This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling. It requires spending more gold or gems rather than actual skills with over priced weapons and gears. The controls are not sensitive and clunky. Overall. Could have been a great game but greedy developers."

Appen är gratis att ladda ned och ni kan prova alla aktiviteter utan kostnad. Ni kan enkelt köpa till filmer, böcker, musik och pyssel i appen. Innehållet som kan köpas finns i Bamsebutiken som skyddas med en barnspärr och koden till ert Google-Konto, så att barn inte köper innehåll utan er tillåtelse. Nytt innehåll kommer att släppas löpande så uppdatera gärna appen kontinuerligt för att få ett större utbud av underhållning. Aktiviteter: • Tecknad film – de klassiska filmerna av Rune Andréasson • Böcker med text och tal • Lek med Bamse – välj en bakgrund och fyll den med figurer och saker • Pannkaksverkstad – laga pannkakor. Varje figur har sin unika fyllning • Musik – härliga Bamsesånger • Klippdockor – klä på och klä om Brumma, Vargen, Bamse och flera andra Bamse och hans vänner välkomnar er till en värld av underhållning och roligheter! Appen kräver WiFi-anslutning när den laddas ned. När innehållet är nedladdat kan det användas utan internetförbindelse. Om Ni har problem med att ladda ned/spela upp film eller annat köpt innehåll från applikationen, kan ni klicka på honungsburken med pilen överst på skärmen och starta nedladdningsprocessen därifrån. Om ni använder samma Google-konto behöver ni inte betala igen för redan köpt innehåll. På samma sätt kan ni ladda ned appen på flera Android-enheter och ni kan ta bort och installera om Bamse-appen. Det kostar inget extra. Om ni laddar ned appen på en ny enhet måste allt köpt innehåll laddas ned igen – utan kostnad. Har du feedback?

The addition of game modes recently was a welcome change to the game and has helped me through many hours of boredom. This game overall is very good and I advise you download it.",
        "Awesome......  I love this game.....  So good know!  Nice game but too much adds.....  U can make some more  planes ae paid.....  But plz remove adds.....  U make some planes to buy in real money too....  Also some levels too...  But worst thing is adds...  Plz remove them all",
        "Last update killed it. Can't even see the bottom row to select anything. It's covered by an ad and the aircraft selection covers it as well and won't go away. Makes it unplayable.",
        "This game is absolutely garbage. It's a rip off and the graphics are terrible. Don't waste your time on it. It burns your phone and every second there is a add",
        "Paying doesnt remove ads, not worth it.  UPDATE 2/24/18, still no reconciliation from the developer on the pay scam. I'll be going to Google for a refund. I do not recommend this app.  This is a fun game - one you can pick up for a few minutes, or for an hour. I played it before the challenge modes and was still entertained. The ease of use combined with incresing intensity keeps you very engaged. Heres the catch - TOO MANY ADS!   I paid the $3 for an \"no ads\" experience, only to encounter the same ads that appear in game and after every round, and on screen. The only thing paying for it does is shorten the ad run time, so you can close them after about 5-10 seconds. I am not pleased about this and would not have paid for it if I had known.   Buyers beware...",
        "Way to many adds and when I paid to remove them they were still there. Tried to contact them and they never replied. Had to get a refund through Google play. Don't waste your time with this app."

Been playing for months now, still love it, definately not a play to win if you get into a good alliance",

Also, good graphics but control are not good enough. It malfunctions and player with bad connection has advantage and wins game and money.  That's problematic.",
        "Well... sometimes when I play some people I think mite be hacking the game or cheating. they don't miss one shot and I make none or sometimes one or two, that is the only down side but other than that it's a good game (suggesten have people by gold or game coins with the money in the game)",
        "The game would be better if you could do anything with the cash you win besides just play in different courts.  Making the player use gold bars for EVERYthing is lame.  I'd rather watch an occasional add and be able to buy cool gear with my cash..",
        "The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It's so obvious a money grab for mini games, it's sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you'll have to beat anyone. That's why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren't any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.",
        "Rigged,when you have clearly beaten the block attempt in challenge mode,your shot gets blocked or when you make a move the opponent steals,when you try the same it doesn't work. Fix this then the game would be better.",
        "I liked the game more personally before the recent update. I have a newer phone & since game play mostly in shooting basket race is glitchy, along with buying things on the app, I hate that you can only have room for so many bags it makes it me want to stop playing after a bit. I can see waiting 15 min, 30, 45min, maybe an hour but not up to 12 hours. I used to like being able to buy the standard bag for old gold bar gave me something to look forward too if I won gold in a match."

        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "It's a  fun game but it's rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn't be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I'm bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I'm level 43 .",
        "Amazing.  It's just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I've played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.",
        "This is a fun game however it allows people to cheat or it's rigged. It's no coincidence that the better I play the better my opponent plays. I think half the time we are playing a rigged computer. I spent $50 on this app in a week and I am deleting it now. Sorry crooked people that run this app."

        "Enjoyable game. Don't have to spend money on diamonds unless you're after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?",
        "I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!",
        "This is the best fashion game by far however there are a few small issues. 1) the same people with the highest level of hair and make-up always win more than anyone 2) you need to win more diamonds and money given how much you have to spend on daily challenges and 3) you need a shopping cart option during challenges so you don't have to go back and find the last item you liked.  Its a great game of you can afford to by diamonds with your debit card.",
        "Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don't mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉",
        "Best game EVER!! I love this game sooo much! The only problem is that you don't get to move on to the next level fast enough. I do hate that so much.And also e everything costs diamonds and u don't get alot of that.  But other than that, good game!! Highly recommended.",
        "Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential"

        "This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.",
        "Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.",
        "Several times now I've tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn't see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",
        "First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there's a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I've typed in before",
        "Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn't take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I'm wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don't know some of the logos what is the point of the game.",

        "I think the shooting range should be mechinary the bullet shouldn't be reloaded . It should be going as many as it can. Nice game. Really I don't play games but for cover fire am in love with it. And please there should be no end of it because am playing it. Till I lost my phone. 😂",
        "This is very nice game, but problem is all time it's will show the upgrade the card's.. So do some change.. game and graphic are really good.. but card updation is boring, I will give one opinion please change the updation of card's system....... And energy need to play its taken so much time.. So we are not playing these game for long..... Please change some of these problem.... Except the card updation system and energy systems... The game is really challenging. please improve some changes",
        "All good and I've completed all ur levels in 10days. Now I'm awaiting for ur new levels and one more which I'm surprised is that.. I'm expecting some stories to end it. I've understood so far that there are other side people who are building some thing and they r trying to stop us but I have not understood why these 2 group are fighting and who is the leader in my group and theirs too. U need to make some more realistic stories so that we can take it part of action movie.. Thanks otherwise",
        "This is my most honest review..Never have I ever played a game truly this fantastic where you literally don't have to spend real money if you could wait 4 hrs for every chest. Gameplay is amazing and then there are events which make the experience even more enthralling. Give this piece a go.",
        "Great graphics, good storyline, campaign mode is challenging. It would be better if more scenarios could be added for skirmishes. Overall enjoyed it. I will recommend even for those who don't wish to spend money on games.",
        "It's really very nice game and good missions.The controls are very easy. Actually I don't like shooting games,but after seeing this I really felt awesome and got interested in shooting games."

With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, \"puzzles\".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).",
        "I love the game, but i liked it more when the piggy bank had 100 gold bars. It was a fair price-amount report. Also, i would love to see more often the trick or treat and the win 14 challanges event. And yes, the new owl look is awful. Please change it back :-))"

        "Deleted my gplus page for many reasons! Unfortunately! The only way i can officially save my game progress and be able to back it up? Is to sign in hence the gplus pop up! I'm on the fence. This game is not bad at all.....so far. We'll see! I can't wait too long to decide though! A new series has a time limit, Thanks for that!",
        "why do u keep showing use pictures of cars that have decals and graffiti on them even though we can't put decals or car skins on are car in the mod shop I t even shows on the picture that says tons of customisation with a car with graffiti but no in mod shop there's no decals its just solid colors? :( why? I still like game though I just hope u add that",
        "Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won't reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.",
        "Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don't understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn't gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.",
        "When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don't have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don't expect to progress very far if you don't want to spend money."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ❤👏👏",
        "Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the \"First Touch\" as fast as possible.",
        "Great game. Controls could seize to work at times (not very often though) but as a whole, it is a fantastic game. Quality graphics and game play. It would be nice if the game could auto-update(with internet connection) so teams could be updated and players could be at their current clubs e.g Coutinho (Barca), Alexis (Man utd ), Mkhritaryan(Arsenal)etc. Love this game"

        "Loved the game for the first few minutes as it is very simple and interesting. BUT may photos temperature started to climb and quickly shot through the roof to a point where it literally burns you! And it kills your battery! For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.",
        "Silly pointless battery killing little game, I loved it! The game kinda runs out of puff after level 150 though, as there is nothing else to achieve. I've got all the prestige balls, all the regular balls, all above level 150. Can we have some higher order balls above Thunder please?",
        "Looks BORING at first. But I can't put it down now. And to those complaining about the adds, spam the back button after they start. The only adds this doesn't work for are the ones with the fast forward button in the top left",
        "Would give this a better review, but there are so many glitches. You can only upgrade a booster once, then you have to close the app and open it again so you can keep upgrading. Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.",
        "The first thing that happens when you open the game is collect what you've earned while you're away. And whether or not I pick the X2 option I have to wait through a 30 second add. Every. Time. Whoever decided to force adds at every collection is costing the developer a lot of money.",
        "Would have give  a great review, however I bought the no ads extra and to my surprise paying the no ads gave me more ADS. So many ads it's gotten to the point where this is unplayable. Wish I would have saved my cash because now I feel like I have been scammed."

        "I'm loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don't change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can't go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. I like the breakable rear lights on some of the cars. Maybe add deflatable tires? Very good game all in all",
        "Need a 67 Shelby mustang gt 500 fastback \"Eleanor\". Also needs a hand brake for sharp turns and drifting and maybe an inside view with steering wheel and stick shift. Very fun and addicting game. Great job here. Multi-player would be cool too.",
        "This game is awsome!  Controls and graphics can be a little laggy,  but the large amount of tracks and cars to unlock and play around with makes up for it. My favorite car is the Duke Wagon Classic, nitro-charged, with a v-8 dropped into it.  Will kick butt in any race or derby! My only suggestion would be on the physics of the cars... Instead of having the bodies simply crush and get smaller/deformed, it would be cool to see body panels and  small pieces like lights and mirrors fall right off. Just a thought. Also it would be cool to have more big station wagon type cars.",
        "This game is really fun and additive I play it EVERYDAY. This game is by far the best demolition derby game I,ve  played. For my free car I would like a lykan hypersport please!!! ;-) If you do not know what it is please look it up and please try to make it they are really cool, fast, and exotic cars. If not I would like tank. Thank you for reading.",
        "Cool game! Good grapich! Nice control! Fun Game!  Well, this game need more jumpy track and smaller road for racing. Imagine if you race and the car jumping through the track. Idk why straight maps its not very fun to play. I want downhill track with ultra high jump im sure lot of epic moment will happened there   And jumpy map for derby mode with more obstacles and every maps must have its unique\u200b thing like falling rock or bouncy bomb im sure this will give more fun.  Car? I want the car have accessories like extra headlight, bumper or weapon? 20° arc ram in front of car will give more fun and and rear mirror and driver POV camera  Well, i want ice cream truck, the officially derby monster truck, hot wheels car and F1? :/",
        "I had loved this game until it stopped saving my car purchases. Like my last  one the pick up that looks exactly like a 80s chevy with the cap off and roll cage. I put 7.0 motor in it with NOS tires and paint. Went in this morning it was gone. Please fix.Norton also says you're monitoring my location how obtrusive you dushbags."

        "I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.",
        "Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating 'the option' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.",
        "I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the 'hints' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven't discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it's not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.",
        "It's a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don't find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.",
        "I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It's educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it's just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁",
        "Other reviews are accurate  for me.. hints become irritating in that they only flash on for a second and you miss them rather than find them useful.  They also appear too soon so you have little time to search.  I also found the occasional issue registering a word and having to go over it several times. But it's a free game, it's fun, it's addictive what else is there to say ? It's good."

        "I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It's miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi",
        "Great game. Only after the latest update, it stopped registering my race wins and best times and although I did win many, they're not marked with a star and I can't move any level up.",
        "Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there's some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That's pretty lame. Other than that great game",

        "Okay listen, this app is surely good and relaxing, but I must say, i am having trouble with getting the game right easily. What I am trying say is sometimes the game freezes and I am coming upon some glitchey reactions. I would really appreciate if you made the game a little more calm or just review some things you can edit. I would like to keep contact with you. So if you have any suggestions on how you can make the game a little better just let me know. I'm looking forward to some edits here so I hope you can figure something out. I'm not trying to be bossy, I'd just wanted a little arrangement for your game. So just keep working hard on your games. Thank you very much! Okay now I gotta play the game. Bye!",
        "UPDATE- STILL NO MORE LEVELS ONCE I'VE GOTTEN TO 1190.. IF THIS IS THE END PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN DELETE APP AND MY HUSBAND CAN STOP WASTING HIS TIME PLAYING IT!!! ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I'm on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn't have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!",
        "I'm not trying to be a hard ass, but I take issue when games like yours automatically goes into a tutorial mode instead of offering it as a choice. It drives me crazy. If your game gave the user the choice of either to use the tutorial or not my ratings would be between 4 & 5 stars.",
        "It was exactly what I was wanting to play.  Also unlike other previews, yours is what you show right away not after a bunch of other games that are not worth playing to get to the game you thought you had downloaded.",
        "Plays fair - at least, so far. By that I mean some games like this stack the deck against you. This one seems to realize that if I lose too many times I am likely to uninstall it. No ad income when that happens.",
        "Its a fun game but the animations move very fast and it's hard to tell what's going on. Also, there are way too many ads"

The cloths aren't that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!",

        "This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I've tried that you'd think would make something but don't. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.",
        "This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won't let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I've used it before, but now it won't let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.",
        "This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they've all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.",
        "The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.",
        "I love this game so much. I'm stuck on trying to make life but it's not frustrating it's challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant 'use' them anymore it's because you can't combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn't waste space for the things you can use, it's actually a very smart game mechanic. I'm pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn't take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.",
        "Its a cool game. If you press the hint button it gives you a choice to watch a ad for help. I am not seeing in-app purchases so far and I have had this game for a while! I recommend this but not the other version. It gets a tiny bit boring after a while though. overall, GREAT GAME! Whoever made this game is great! :) :) :)"

        "There should be a technical scoring piece during each skating event (such as when your practicing in the game's Gym in hard mode in hoping to leveled-up...\"perfect\", \"cool\", \"missed\", etc.). The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate [150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is \"strictly Russian\" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)]! Each event should have qualification rounds to add to the nerves of each skater! ( =",
        "Its a good game and i enjoy it but the graphics are bad because my game gliches and i dont know whats going on. Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I'm going through please fix the game up a bit 😄",
        "What a nice game coco made, love the pair mode. Amazing ice skating moves too. But what i don't see from the app picture is the holiday (Christmas) items in the game? Other than that, make more gamez of this...😄😉👍👌💙",
        "Ok lmy phone then I fell asleep guess what they did they put the game a start over then what!!! Nope I ilwill not play one of games I will play Roblox and Roblox good fame but I still have cocoa and the point is that I can't delete it bye bye Coco",
        "So It's a good game and all but after I reached 1687 fans my coach keeps saying after each round \"let's make me the best skater ever!\" Shouldn't it be changing up? And also should it be me saying that instead of the coach??",
        "Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked! So EVERY time you close the game you have to start over? No thanks! Good bye! YOU SUCK with your ad ridden games! Will not be downloading another of yours!"

        "There's absolutely no way you're able to go through all the levels unless you spend money at some point or you just wait out the lives recount. It's a good freemium game, but don't bother redoing levels unless it's to earn more coins for essential upgrades. This game WILL take your money if you let it.",
        "This game is soooo fun!! Its better than Cooking Fever. I love this game!❤ the levels get harder but that's the fun of it. And the food makes me really hungry🍔! But the thing is that after a few days (when i first got the game) it didn't let me play the game, it just stayed at 89 percent. So I got the game again but it still did it😭.",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again.",
        "The game really very good.. it really liked concept nd i play it for hours.. but after unlocking paris I am facing difficulty to complete the levels.. even though i play efficiently some levels just cant be completed they require special add ons or purchases.. this makes game frustrating..even after giving my best i am not able to complete levels.. if its due to any error plz correct it asap otherwise i have to delete it coz i cant go any further in this game with this nd its frustrating me.. thank u",
        "I loved this game until today so it gets 1 star. Too many glitches or prompts. Right after I spend money on in-app purchases in order to use during a stage, my game froze. Another time, a prompt for an update popped up as soon as I used an in-app purchase and froze the entire game. Keep in mind, I'd already been playing for a good while. I won't be spending any more money in this game and some levels are set up to where you'd have to spend so I guess I'll eventually be uninstalling. It's fun, addictive but glitchy and steals your money.",
        "I'm addicted!! but please, don't make the game needs to connect to the internet the whole timee :( sometimes, we do play games bcs we don't have internet access. hope can consider this :) thanks in advance"

        "One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don't mind paying for it as well..",
        "I love the game!really entertaing!but i HOPE you ADD THIS WISHLIST!Here's  my wishlist of superstars to this game that will make it even better,FIRST OFF,REY MYSTERIO,HULK HOGAN,THE BOOGEYMAN, SHANE MCMAHON$, AND LAST FOR THE BEST,THE DUDLEYS AND THE DX! (Including  new age outlaws ajd xpac too)and change the shirts of shawn and triple h into the dx shirts PLZ! I mostly think you'll  add these legends for RAW 25 years characters and rey as the royal rumble character!",
        "reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.",
        "So honestly i love most of this game. However, you can notice that when gathering loot chests, there is a normal wheel of fortune scenario, with a decipherable pattern. However, if you look closely the game changes the options on the wheel if you come close to getting one of the better options. So instead of getting a 4 star superstar in big bundles you will get the crappiest 2 star superstar and in others you will get 150 cash insteadof a superstar. Ita ridiculous because that means that how much ever money you spend on the game, they rig it so you cannot win the bigger items.",
        "The gameplay and controls are great!!! But it will be better if the themes of each superstar were added. One things that annoys me is that the superstars are rated very oddly....John Cena is rated less than Elias....How can it be so???!!! If the rating system of the game is fixed then definitely a 5 star for this game.",
        "Enjoyed the game.. until i unlocked versus mode and when it asked me to re-sync with facbook it reset everything. My guys, my level,and anything i purchased was gone.  Support wasnt much of a help as they reinbursed me.. but then it rrset again repeatedly. Uninstalled, wasted time and money. Very dissapointed."

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.",
        "It's nice how you've mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn't expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!",
        "This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!"

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don't understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I'm supposed to have 92, I don't get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don't care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn't count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I'm going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn't come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

It's easy to earn money, food and useful items just by shaking trees in the community or watching ads. I've gotten many things from letting my Boo sleep and watching ads, then getting to pick a gift. The customization of your personal boo is also fantastic. Great way to entertain children or unwind at the end of the long day.",
        "Do you have a pet? If not, My Boo is a great way to know how it feels to have something to look after. With loads of awesome mini games, it's so fun to dress your Boo up in cute outfits and hairstyles! Feed it and play with it and it will love you! Honestly, I don't know how else to put this: My Boo is the best (and cutest) game ever!",
        "This game is really fun and cute!! I love it, its great when you're super bored, or something. The only problem I'm having, is the when I go to change my boo's name, it won't let me delete any of the letters. Sooo... Yeah, um, other than that, its a great game. Also... WHY NO DELETE!?!? 😲 plz fix.",
        "I love this app. I have searched long and hard for a perfect virtual pet, and I found it in this cute little game. I LOVE the minigames, and the cute little sounds and faces the boo makes add to the charm of this game. Also, I love how there are a TON of options for customization, and even different kinds of food. I only wish there weren't so many ads and in app purchases... Oh well, a little thing like that won't stop me from loving this app.  My little Boo is named Marcellus, and I care for him as though he were a real animal. Lol",
        "Me and my daughter have both loved this game for years! Entertaining with so many games and ways to decorate boos...although we wish coins were a bit more for gameplay. Some if the outfits we've never been able to afford!",
        "I love the game and it's so addictive! I check on him about every ten minutes. The only problems I have are that Boo' s energy goes so fast as well as when I'm not playing I keep getting notifications saying that he's full of energy and wanting to play, when I then open the app it says he's too tired to play even if I put him to bed for quite a long time? Please fix? Would give 5 stars if that's fixed! Over all it's a great game, very fun!😊"

        "simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!",
        "I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝",
        "YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D",
        "Simple gameplay, no punishments for going AFK, simple ranked system, a little bit of P2W with new heroes and awaken system, but still based around skill, as a 4th awaken level BarBarQ can beat a 5th awaken one. Some things that we dont have counterplay to seem like complete BS at first, but once we find counterplay, it makes for an even match",
        "It is the best game I've ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won't notice how long you've played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can't connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it's still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.",
        "Hello! I've seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game's connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!"

        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want",
        "First off, I'd like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It's amazing.  However, I've been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can't pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.",
        "This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I'm very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.",
        "I have 'noisy' brain and anxiety and sometimes the world is too much to bear. This game keeps me calm and collected all the time. The music and gameplay soothe me up. I do get frustrated over the goals but I have nothing but praise and love for this game. Thank you to everyone involved. You all helped a lot. Cannot wait for Alto's Odyssey for Android!"

        "Cute game, but not without it's flaws. I forgot the reasons I deleted the game in the past, but remember them now. It drains your battery, the life refresh time is high (20 minutes) and starting at a certain level (30) you really can't progress WITHOUT friends (this is not a positive for everyone. I personally don't like it), or money, or a ton of patience. You need keys to progress. You can either buy, ask friends, or play for one every FOUR HOURS. This is the exact point where I uninstalled the game last time.",
        "I would taste this game higher if the only way you could progress wasn't by having to purchase extras. Having to waste all my extras to get through a gate with 3 keys sucks and so does knowing that really the only way through is to buy your way through.",
        "I'm uninstalling game! I was really happy with game when I started,  now there is an ad every next life and sometimes more! Same ad over and over, enough to drive you CRAZY! Also you can't answer quick text or do anything off screen without the game totally rebooting,  it's supposed to be relaxing to play on phone,  NOT IRRITATING!",
        "I would give this 5 stars, if you could select a level of difficulty, like easy, medium and hard.  It is not relaxing at all, once you pass the early levels. I hate the levels with bullies, you should be able to skip them.",
        "Was great at first, but is now so slow that it takes around five minutes to load the next level - or just to return to replay a failed level. Shame, as I've stopped playing it because of this fault.",
        "Why bother having an X on the Level Rush notification if it doesn't work so you have to press Begin and wait for the animation to finish before you can carry on with claiming the Daily Challenge. Also 'play with friends' on the tournament never does anything. Otherwise fun."

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "Great way to spend down time at work or at home. Really enjoy playing as characters from both light and dark side teaming up and defeating others. It does take awhile to get charcters leveled up. However can spend some money if you don't want to grind. However I find it rewarding grinding each day to get what i want.",
        "Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you're either going to have to pay lots of real money or you'll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!"

        "I love this game, it's simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I'd really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the 'I' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.",
        "I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It's amazing all around.  It's adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven't noticed any bugs either. The developer's done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it's still fun. Can't wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!",
        "This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she'll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she's tried. I'm really happy i found this game!!",
        "This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don't have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There's nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I'm level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)",
        "You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this",
        "This is a great game that I've played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it'd still fun to play. My only gripe is that there's no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it'll be 5 stars all the way for me."

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",

        "Ad heavy. I understand watching ads to get extra money for upgrades, but are ads after every single race really necessary?  The game itself isn't bad. Really good time killer. The ads kind of make me want to stop playing, though."

        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.",

        "So I'm changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it's a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I'd rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!",
        "This game is fun but I don't know if it's a bug or they're doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there's no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I'm about to uninstall this game.",
        "I have downloaded and uninstalled it and did the same process over again and I still can't play it. It keeps telling me that it needs an active internet connection to play. Well, I can play my other internet based mobile games and I am writing this review from the same mobile device and everything else that requires internet is working so it is a fault in the game itself. It's a shame because I really wanted to play this but now I am going to uninstall it and not bother with it again because it is frustrating me. If the issue gets fixed somehow then I may think about playing it.",
        "GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they're pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must 'assemble' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus 'dice'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.",
        "I'll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn't be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.",
        "Why am I losing over half of my games? This has happened twice! I have to forfeit several games and when I do all the people start a new game with me. Sorta suspicious. The game has been lagging and freezing also. Otherwise it's a great time passer!"

On my phone I get network error (I'm data only) and my tablet says the game isn't compatible. It's marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it's not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I'm not running a speed test.",
        "Requires some patience but is a really fun game. Don't expect to fly through the tutorial but they make it fun learning the steps. What I enjoy the most, is its NOT lagging down my processor with ads. Only thing I wish is that the home base was a little more organized.",
        "The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it's getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..",
        "I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I'm sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn't stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻",
        "Love the game, would give 5 stars, but lost 2 high-level characters and quite a bit of $ due to lack of anything resembling customer service. If you have to reinstall for any reason, and can't remember your password, be prepared to lose all progress because if you can't sign in right the first time, there's no way to sign out, or to contact someone to help recover your character.",
        "I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out.."

        "Fun game, good time killer, great graphics. Unfortunately,  like with many other games, they sucker you in with rewards at the start only for you to soon hit a paywall. It's  either grind and hope you get lucky or give into the many game ads promoting cash purchases. Anything involving actually online play (co-op, PvP etc) seems to freeze or have crazy lag. Good game, definitely has room for improvement.",
        "It's a good cover-based shooter, with some pretty creative characters and a good pace for quick battles. The unlock system is more than fair, with the ability to save currencies for that one big purchase. I enjoy the ability to play at my own pace without sacrificing my life to the game (cough*Kabam*cough) and I'm having a lot of fun. I've noticed that PVP tends to favor Savage, when he activates Spray and Pray once, half the opposing team dies. Twice, and the round is over. Otherwise a very well done and enjoyable game.",
        "I really enjoy the action this game brings along with good looks and simple controls. Too many times development teams get caught up in the visuals or complex control schemes and forget about what gamers really love and that's not having a complex control panel with nice smooth transition from level to level. Thank you for making this game a joy to play every time I turn it on.",
        "Nice game ...the only problem  I say would be its pay to win philosophy. Yeah it's easy in the beginning but the gear gets really scarce to if your really trying to win it'll be next to impossible to do so with out swiping that good 'ol debit card. Otherwise it's a fun and awesome game. That is in the beginning....",
        "Good concept. Good game. Many glitches. For a game that's touted for and based on pvp it makes no sense that %80 of the time the game freezes going into a pvp battle. It's okay though, you can close it and then immediately reopen it to a message that tells you that you died. Fix your freezing problems and I'd give you 4 stars.",
        "Really solid graphics and game play for mobile. Doesn't want to work with my Bluetooth controller. As a free game they have really doubled down on the shards and multiple currencies to try to get you to spend. You really need to grind if you want to unlock anything without paying."

Need more transport holes or vases and plants to hide behind. So many great comments, it's baffling to me.  Wish I  knew the tricks to get as far as a lot of the reviewers do.  Looks like it COULD BE A FUN GAME, but in present form, it's too challenging for me.  Bummer. Guess I'll have to uninstall it.",

        "I think that the game is silly yet good!This game does not have another level of playing. I think that the temple ruins and waterfall and the other levels are the same!e but the description given to it is a little too much. The levels do not have anything more than just the same setting. I think that the creator of his game should've made the game in such a way that it has different levels and it helps us to get more bananas or something like that. But overall, the game is pretty good. Good job on the game.😁😁",
        "My kids enjoy this game however I think there should be an option where you can use your bananas to skip a challenge as some are quite hard to do. This will make the game better as it's pretty pointless without the challenges  Cheers",
        "I think this game gets hanged easily.!!And my daughter likes this app. But it needs a little new version!! And as I would like to tell my friends also.!! But, this game needs a little change like, Now you can skip the adds ,than not get hanged easily or like that And etc.!!! ThaNks I think you can do better !!",
        "I played this as a kid, now I'm playing this again as an adult and the DEVELOPER SCREAM NEVER FAILS TO MAKE ME GIGGLE. THANK YOU. U GOT MY 5 STARS",
        "Very fun and addicting game. love it. but the graphics could be better and more interesting. It just seems kind of repetitious. There should be better graphics on all levels. But still in all it's a great game!",
        "NOT GOOD I SEE A VIDEO TO CONTINUE AND ITS SAY U PHONE WILL GET HACK WHAT PROBLEM IS THIS GUYS DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APPS NOT GOOD. !!              -"

        "This game is the only one of it's kind that I've ever really gotten into. But I fell in love with it and have gotten some real cool friends out of it. They really have thought everything thru and keep improving the game play consistently. Other than not explaining a few parts of the game enough I really don't have any complaints.  You really don't have to spend money, as long as you are an active player an devote enough time to it. And from what I have heard about other games it's not quite as crazy of a $$$ spong as some other games my brother plays. Over all I think this if a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for that new game to occupy your boredom & spare time. I give it a 9 outta 10.",

        "If you pay to play you win, to many over powered players constantly attacking smaller players. I will be uninstalling soon",
        "Pretty cool it gives u just enough resources actually I think give you a pretty decent amount could be a little more though but still love the graphics design and it's pretty easy to play"

It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they're inside of it, you're doing damage to the car, not to mention you can't even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!",

Words cannot fully express what this game means to me! Thanks to the developers I look forward to playing everytime. The music is wonderful! I highly recommend this game. Thanks again ♡",
        "As much as I understand that you want to make a few bucks, the amount of advertising and the way the advertising is being presented has gradually become quite intrusive and annoying. I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "I absolutely love this game! It's not all that noisy kids stuff! I start my day off with my tea and M.J.! It's a great way to get the Brain up and running! 💜 I've deleted the game 3 times. Alas, I just can't give up! Here I am again! And thoe I've tried alot of other similar games, it's this one that is the most satisfying! 💜",
        "Does not even lay tiles down in a solvable fashion. Had no repeats thus shud be solvable in any order, wasn't, what's the point? Sort ur algorithm out.  Also, non stop ads and u want us to pay monthly for ad free? £8 one off fee wud b highest I went for an app I'd want to keep",
        "Was a fun game until  after the recent update. Used to be able to close the ads, but now they just keep playing instead of closing. Will find a better version somewhere else.",
        "The latest update places advertising banners in the play area. You can't move them or play around them and I don't want to install the advertisement app.  They suck out loud."

There are some flaws, mainly in the fact that there are only a few maps so more maps would be nice. Also, it would be nice if you could change the name or if there is a way, tell me. There are other slightly bad things but overall a great game.",
        "Great concept the only thing wrong with it is the slow movement's that happens some Times during the game hope  that you all fix it. Another thing is the lack of stages there are only four to three stages and all of them are with ice add more and I guarantee your that your ratings is going to rise. Finally the option to change your name at the main screen and better control's than just jumping. Would love to play it once these issues are fixed and I don't mean to be harsh hope you all got my opinions",

The AI's are OP and there is no point in playing the game. Its a much better idea to just buy the real game on steam instead. 100x better",

        "Unique offering by Infinite .. I haven't seen a game like this before nor did I expect to .. you form a pot as it spins on a pottery wheel. You can widen it, narrow it, make it taller or shorter. The goal of the game becomes forming pots as per Aunt Chloe's instructions and then painting it as she dictates. You send the pot to her for cash.. and more pots to make. The controls are decent but a bit quirky at times when trying to form the pot.",
        "Fantastic and very creative game... I give it 4 stars... And leave 1 star only because its brushes are not free after african.... it is my humble request to developers that please provide some more brushes for free.... And if possible (free the whole brushes 😋)... Ha ha ha ha... Nice job developers....👍👍👍 Akash Prafulla Barik \"Baadal\" (India)",
        "Loved this game! A relaxing timekiller when you have nothing else to do. Quite addicting as well. Inspires me to do pottery in real life! The only things I don't like is that you have to buy the full version for $5, alhough if it was entirely free I'd probably get bombarded by ads.. A fun game, nonetheless!",
        "I installed it for time pass, but my 21 month old baby without even we teaching her how to play, learned it on her own, and she is an expert. She gets scores as high as 272. I know it is very bad for such small baby to play in mobile, but sh gets very upset.",
        "This game definitely deserves five stars. Here are a few reasons I love it.  1. Graphics- The quality of the app is surreal and offers the viewer a fun experience in the gameplay.  2. Gameplay- The letters/messages you receive to re-create the photo of are very intriguing in my opinion and I wish I could get the full version for more.  3. Thank You- The work that must have been put in to this game is incredible and I hope one day I can get the full version. I enjoy all of your apps and hope to see more.",
        "It's just that you have to make the full version download free. We don't have to make the payment of the Game. When we download the game in the starting of the game we get message but after that we don't. Now l'm bored 'cause the messages for making new pots are not coming...... Pls just make it what l'm saying. But baki all is a good job.............................."

I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",

It connects and puts me in a race sometimes but nobody is there.... or sometimes it just glitches before putting me in to the race.......... sort it out. I'm deleting this bull.",

        "Oh how I say something for it. I have  no words to say for it. It's fashion and it's looks are great. When I see it's video I am surprised to see it. But first time I see it's logo I think it is borring. But this time I am really surprised to see it. This is the best game in world for girls. When I do all comments for other games they are not really good. But this game is the best. If you install it you like too. If you have any quari in this you can write and I will  check it. Thanks for reading this.",
        "I LOVE IT SO MUCH I THINK THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! GREAT GRAPHICS GREAT CONTROLS The only problem is that i have is that you have to buy other stuff with real money...its kinda sad tho Coco if u r reading this pls do a time limited event like something like all of the things are free so that u cant buy the whole version like do the time limited event only for 1 day pls i really love the game supper pls pls pls♡♡♡  -Gallaxy",
        "I really like this game but when I played it, it froze up.  It froze up so bad that it wouldn't turn off and when it did, it wouln't turn on.  We actually had to get a new phone. I'm sorry I gave you 3 stars but we had to actually buy a whole new phone.",
        "This game is so much fun! You don't have to pay for the spa or the doctor which is not very common for most coco games. The moves and clothes are great and this game is a great time killer I can play it all day and not get bored. Good job Coco! Please make more! Like maybe a swimmer one and have like dances in the water or maybe a soccer or sports one and maybe add boy characters in your game I am not a boy but It would be cool if you added boy characters.",
        "The game would be sooo much better if there wasn't ads after every little thing you do. Come on with all the ads already. I would give 5⭐'s if you could take away most of the ads. Im not saying all of them but its over kill right now.",
        "Firstly, this game of course, like All, would be Completely better without All the annoying commercials. I also would like for the controls to be more fine tuned making gameplay alot easier to navigate. Lastly, I would like more input in the moves that the skating competitions...not just watching the game control all the skaters moves."

        "Maybe add an option to disable some graphics. Like the fimish animation. It does not add much to the game experience but it affects the performance quite a bit.  About the ads: I have premium, and I only have to watch an ad if I choose to get a reward in return. There are no sudde, unwanted or random ads anymore.",
        "Simple game. Ads galore. Also when ads pop up better not be listening to music because it's gonna pause your music even if the ad has 0 sound. Thus the one star rating. You can advertise all you want but don't interrupt any background apps to force me to look at your ad. That's just messed up.",
        "First of all the game it self is a great little game. Graphics are fine game play is simple and easy to pick up it's a good game. Now for the reason it only gets two stars. WAY TO MANY ADS! I mean for f@$k sake every two seconds there's an ad. Click on the car buying button there's an ad. Sit there to long there's an ad. I understand this is how you make your money but come on there's a line and you didn't just cross it you swan dived over that bad boy. I'm sorry but I do not recommended this game for anyone.",
        "Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there's a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.",
        "A 60 second add for every 30 seconds of play is ridiculous. All I can say is don't waste your time unless you like to learn how to kill a game with to many advertisments",
        "Just...bad. The concept is simple enough. It forces you to watch ads pretty much any time you accomplish something, whether you know it or not. The mechanics are poorly-thought-out and I frequently would hit the \"wrong\" button while trying to play, which would cancel my productivity. Not worth my time and not worth yours."

Make a link at end to \"rate the game,\" I wanted to, looked around, in end clicked link to play red then find yellow to do this rating... that's cuz I like yah... thanks for the smile!",

I liked the fact that you are tossed into the game without any tutorials, left on your own. I am not really into puzzle games but I completed this game in a single afternoon and it had me asking for more.",
        "Just finished this one less than 5 minutes ago, I'd definitely have to say I enjoyed red more. yellow had some more difficult puzzles. Some of them were (kinda?) reused in red. I overall enjoyed it a lot!   I'm really looking forward to the next one!",
        "It's so captivating I finished it in a single morning! I love how challenging the puzzles are at the same time they are fun. The level 49 made me go crazy because I couldn't get it right, I had to draw the squares  so I wouldn't press the wrong one. I totally loved it and I'm so going to download red!",
        "I love Bonte  games. As always, beautiful graphics and just the right level of difficulty. Looking forward to the next one. Thanks Bart. I just have to edit this to add that I don't understand why people are complaining about ads. You only need to watch them for a hint, and only briefly. It's a free game, and the developer has to make a living. You can pay to get them removed, but they really aren't obtrusive at all.",
        "To be honest, I was like this is going to be boring 💤, but within minutes, I was totally hooked. Absolutely amazing, love it. If fact, I went straight back online and got red. I've not heard of this Bart Bonte before, but he's a bit magic."

So I will give it sadly a 👎.",

        "I think SA should do a better job than what they are doing. Including me we all be screwed not once not twice but at least five times each player that did not mod and/or hack. You change the damages on skills that should be left alone and over half my friends is in Hacker Hell so my question to u guys fix this and give us some gifts cuz we've been faithful for giving you guys money and it be nice to receive some compensation.",
        "This game is very nice! But I would suggest adding a single player, so that you can find your mate, make pups and bring them with you on multi player! Also add more wolf colors and designs! You could also make different landscapes if you want and if you can, you shouls also add bosses and dens for us to live at, this game is very nice and addictive, but I think that if you add all that I mentioned it would become even more popular and addictive! Please hear my plea!",
        "If you're looking for a great game, this is not it!!! It's a pay to win, with NOTHING to win. Unless you're into running in circles chasing woodland animals for months, having your money stolen, or having your stats lowered by the devs after you've worked on it... I suggest finding a different game. Really look at all these reviews if you don't believe me.",
        "Well, the graphics are amazing! There are nice views in the game and the animals look cool aswell. There are a few things I would like SA to add and the first one is: mates and cubs. Second is: add friends. Third is: you can eat your own prey and drink water. The Last one is: to make your own separate packs (atleast 5 wolves in each.) That's all! If you do any of these I will rate 5 stars! Other than that this is an amazing game. I like the way you can choose your wolf. Recommended for sure!!!!",
        "ok the game is great and I love it but why can't you play with lower levels and higher levels? It's not fair when you have a friend you want to play with and help them with their levels but you can't if you are to high of a level it's really not fair and I think you should remove this part of the game everything else is amazing though! I really love this game but I also don't want to have to level up or wait for someone to level to play with my friends so please fix this!!",
        "This game is amazing the best game I love it so much. But I wish the game look like loading screen and plz plz plz make them the wolf better like the white wolf should be fast and stronger where as the the grey wolf should be strong and have more health and the Mexican wolf should be good in defences and health and black wolf should be good in strength and health and speed and there should be multiple maps and are there holiday skins. And it will be nice If you can add friend plz add some different skin for the white wolf. Like the mighty wolf should be in the white wolf category. Edit- I would love it if you .ca  make it night with different animals. And one more thing the creates of this game can you plz plz plz plz make a Dragon game like this cause there are not a lot of nice dragon game out there. Like the white wolf have an ice dragon and plz make a lightning Dragon it is my favourite element.  If you can do all of this I would be so happy ."

The game could include a shop to buy things such as powerups or different colours and styles of jetski and some more creative adventures could get the game into a very interesting zone!",

        "Addictive and challenging It makes me put the score I wanna get in mind so I can work towards it and that inspires me to read my books......... If I can determine that I wanna pass my high score who says I can't get better grades....... I love the game keep doing  what your doing and make more games..... To everyone  I advise you to play this game 💖💞",
        "Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn't take up much space.",
        "Oh please shut up. It is a very good game and a nice distraction for kids so stop saying it's not good enough.  If you are still so sure it sucks then try making your own game see how people reject it",
        "I would like to give some ideas. 1.it should have more players.2. It should have more jetski with more abilities in it .3. It should have costumes .4. It also should have some options to update the obstacles. I hope if the next game comes it  shoulx be with these abilities"

        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "excellent game & one of the best minesweeper apps on the market EXCEPT there's no zoom in feature! makes it impossible to play harder modes on a phone cuz you keep accidentally tapping mines when you're trying to clear the spot next to it :("

When you are playing a game where responsive controls matter, having them fail about every 20th swipe is unacceptable.  The other disappointing thing is that Batman is the only one that says anything.  I worked my way to get Robin and when he didn't say anything, I was completely turned off from the game.",

        "To Konami! Game controls are still a nightmare. Can you fix the right  touch in advanced controls. We can't get the ball from opponents, we can't pass,we can't shoot. We need to do this several times for it to work. Do you know that we buy coins to enjoy your super amazing game? And we enjoy it only by at least winning in Superstar level which needs speed and accuracy. Do something and don't annoy us. Kindly",
        "Well overall it is good... Gesture controls are not that much good... So, i insisted to keep on classic controls... It helps me to make a perfect through pass and a perfect finish...but what i couldn't like is the finishing... I love football too much and i am fc barcelona follower... So i will try to make a sequence of passes and boom..! Goal... But i want to score goal by myself... Means that if i want to curve the ball so i can fool the keeper from the long distance... Similar in free kicks... There are many ways to curve the ball in... And game provides the static ways to score in free kick... So please add this functionality...  Moreover of that... I love the game ... It's good... And make it evolve",
        "Been playing the game for a while and changing my rating to a 5.  This game is FUN.  Graphics are top notch, replays, commentay that know your actual player names.  Controls are superp ONCE YOU FIGURE THEM OUT.  Take the time to practice match mode and attack mode to pass without being offside all the time.  Downside is getting good players ridiculously hard.  And online vs another user feels like my team is in slow motion can't even make a pass or two before I'm being slaughtered by 4 goals.",
        "Reality and an awesome soccer game fare smooth free from bugs can be used under slow network connection... U should try it. I kindly request the developers to 2 things...  1. To make the official kits available or all the users make random one. 2. To allow friendly matches extra time and penalty. Thanks",
        "The game has started to lag after the update..gameplay is insane! Most of the balls go to the opponent.. graphics are ok..good game..plz do provide with more black balls.and if you could reduce the energy recovery time it would be great..and request you to give an option for an auction in which we can trade our players with any one playing the game..And also if you could add penalties and extra time..it wld be fun..Need energy Recovery once in a week .Great job!",
        "I love PES18. I have changed the ratings to 1 star because KONAMI have decreased the Squad value of s18 A players and again we have to put effort to sign s18 B marquee players to increase our squad value. I don't know What is the need of this update?  I am not happy with update KONAMI or else you can change s18 A and s18 B have same squad value then I will change my rating to 5 star."

        "The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn't cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can't pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game",
        "Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.",
        "I used to enjoy this game when I had a minute spare. I was cruising at around level 300 enjoy the simplicity of it but not anymore! Since the introduction of the \"ice\" balls, it's become near impossible. Reading the other comment I'm glad to see that others are frustrated with the aim moving right at the last minute. I had this at 5 stars now it's 1.",
        "Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i've also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location",
        "It is a good game but is built to take $$.  There are some levels that will not let you pass without spending $$ which I refuse to do.   I understand the need to make $$, but when it is blatantly built to take money, that is where I have an issue.  I wish I could upload the video of the level this takes place in, then you would understand what I mean. Decent game but sad for the obvious reason for the game.",

        "This has been my fav gameeee I swear this game you will love, and fun with.Its so easy to play, in the first time I play, i got of a score of, 131 how cool is thattt!!!. I cant even image what the new score would be in the future. I swear DOWNLOAD this game u wont regrett!!!!💕",
        "Its a really great game and I really recommend it! The only problems I had was the controls are a little weird and there a little bit of too much ads but I dont mind it but I'd rather you fix it! Thanks for making me happy! ♡",
        "Really good game to sit and relax but would be good if the balls could go faster than 2x speed. If you have high points then it takes a while for every turn to watch them bounce around.",
        "Downloaded this game just to kill some time. It was fun at first but then once I started to play the challenge mode it would not let me see the whole screen during some challenges. So there is no way to win at the challenges that require you finish in a limited number of moves.",
        "Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea"

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and \"WIN\" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.",
        "Awesome graphics, and for what you get on a phone, it really is an amazing game. The only complaint (if you can even call it that) I have is the controls can be a little tricky as sometimes when you're trying to swing left or right you can accidentally change your weapon instead of swing to either side. Aside from that, tremendous gameplay, multiple modes to play, amazing graphics, really just an awesome game. Make sure you have a really good internet connection.",
        "Be prepared the stupidity. 230 armor 120 health isnt enough to protect against the remington. So if u want to survive be prepared to pay more and more always. This game aint fun after a while. More annoying really. Otherwise would recommend it. So look elsewhere if u dont want to pay a hell of a lots of money"

        "I expected the physics to be as flawless as Turborilla's MX games but they're not at all. Clunky, inconsistent physics leave you shaking your head and trying in vain to sum up what you did differently than the 100 previous attempts.",
        "Disappointing...the game would easily be 5 stars, as it is very fun, but once you reach a certain point, it becomes pay to play as you need gold to upgrade your bike to stay competitive with the CPU rider.  Can't even play anymore because it's impossible to progress any further.",
        "Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it's a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz",
        "Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game",
        "Game is very addicting but after a little while of playing you can't hit jump or land! Maybe just me? Also, I don't want to pay for upgrades. Should be merit based on how well you race."

        "Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.",
        "Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.",

They always happened at the beginning and I hate it. I don't think you should not install it its not fun.",
        "This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!"

Story part gets way too hard to manage keeping up with the difficulty even when you pay the subscription unless you spend real money to move along. It's a kids game, people don't have the money to keep up with the difficulty. I will be unsubscribing, subscription doesn't justify the price, everything costs too much and can't progress in the game because of price. Great game, shame it's destroyed by greed.",
        ".     It doesn't tell you how to get past level 75. Or how super power your dinosaurs,  example the opponents dinosaurs that have the purple glow. Also unable to redeem the points on either visitor world or the world ran by facebook. Jurrassic World the game also doesn't tell or show you how to get your dinosaurs to the ultimate stage where  these issues. That's why they get a poor rating from this consumer. If everyone boycotted the game and cancelled their memberships, you can guarantee they would fix all glitches and explain away the issues that are asked.",

        "I was enjoying this game for 5 minutes, and then I couldn't get into it anymore. It tells me to make more then 900 mb space even though I just deleted a couple of gb worth of apps. Once I can play this again it will be fun",
        "It's a great game but it's such a money pit. 9 out of 10 times if you want something, you better get a credit card out otherwise you're waiting 4 days to unlock it. If it weren't for that, I'd have given 5 stars.",
        "I am pretty annoyed by the creation lab. Over 10 attempts to merge a triceratops to get to level 21. Still unsuccessful.  You have to wait 30 minutes between each attempt but its not like I have the time to play every 30 minutes just to be disappointed. So far I have been attempting the same dinosaur for over 24 hours."
