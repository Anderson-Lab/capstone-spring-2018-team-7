        "This game is amazing.  I play several of the spin/build games, but nothing is like this one.  There is so much things that you can do.  I now have my mom, brother, sister, aunt and cousin playing and still bugging other friends and family to play.  Thanks for a great game. LOVE IT",
        "Something has happened.. I am currently playing the attack master event. I have attacked 20 times at least. But the metre only indicates 6 attacks. Everytime I attack I see hammers going to the metre but the number there remains the same. I would have gotten 12 million and evemln more but due to this issue I haven't. It's definitely the fault of game. Please fix it as soon as possible.",
        "Very frustrating to have to work for weeks to earn enough to build in the higher levels and have it constantly being destroyed because in three days worth of spins you only receive 2 shields... not to mention the rarity of free spins (maybe once a week) Game is an exercise in frustration and not worth the download.",
        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",

The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",

And one more thing, Can you explain why I have to wait over 2800 minutes for my next life? It's been 3 days and it went from 2800 minutes to 2300 minutes! Based on your stupid calculations each day is equal to 170 minutes? Give me your supports group email add and I will send you a screenshot!",

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

        "On level 2185, had over 800 different boosters and suddenly all of them are gone, serious glitch in game... emailed their tech center for over 1 week now and only get a automated response and nothing from a real person. Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks"

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players"

You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",

I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "This garbage is nothing like ads show. It's a pay to win mmo that brings nothing new to the table. You can always tell a game will be garbage when their ads are fake. Uninstalled!",
        "Unless you are willing to line their pockets with cash your wasting your time on the game.  You'll never catch up to those who have been playing the game a long time without money.  Parents beware.",
        "Absolutely no support available in the game.  If you're able to take money, people should be able to contact you.  Game is also geared for higher level players to advance by ganging up on new players.   I was attacked 19 consecutive times in a 5 minute period with 6 players attacking me at once.  In short, don't waste your time"

        "I am really disappointed that it takes so much to upgrade each time is insane. I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "Really sets you back when your attacked by much higher lvl characters/kingdoms. There should be level attacking restrictions for example a lvl 5 kingdom shouldnt be able to be ttacked by a lvl 10 kingdom. My only complaint i hope they fix it soon and come up with a visable solution for all. Thank you",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",

You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",

Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

        "great game! auto play is helpful for players who do not have a lot of free time in the real world. eats up battery like a fat kid at a buffet.   not worth downgrading a star but I noticed there is no audio mute option, just turn down volume bar as far to the left. So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",
        "It's been ok so far, I personally don't enjoy the auto feature but I get why it's there... I'm a busy person I have other stuff to do while I really want to game. Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",
        "Not only is it laggy, now after loading and installing the recent update, I can't even log in. After log in screen and after it checks for any update, it logs me out to main menu! This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",
        ".... Like the 100 or more people before me after the March 14th update I'm no longer able to log in for some unknown reason.. No info on the netmarble site about this issue which is odd.. I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",
        "Ok new review, I've passed all 1740 levels would have given 5 stars but the upper levels can only be passed when you hit the right program! Play same level 20-30+ times then suddenly pass with 10-15 moves left!!! Not fun anymore!!! Uninstalled",
        "This game was my favorite, however the lack of being able to reset the game is truly sad 😢 and takes away from my joy of the game! Please give the option for us to reset our play easily, please 💕",
        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",

As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜"

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",
        "Its a good game but the rewards for tickets are rubbish , last 6 times i claimed gold reward for 1000% more cash , its given less than 200,000 which is rubbish get more for the bronze , needs sorting",

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one.

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with.

So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning.

        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio."

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

    "descriptionHTML" : "Join your friends in a brand new 5v5 MOBA showdown against real human opponents, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang! Choose your  favorite heroes and build the perfect team with your comrades-in-arms! 10-second matchmaking, 10-minute battles. Laning, jungling, tower rushing, team battles, all the fun of PC MOBAs and action games in the palm of your hand! Feed your eSports spirit!<br><br>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, 2017&#x2019;s brand new mobile eSports masterpiece. Shatter your opponents with the touch of your finger and claim the crown of strongest Challenger!<br><br>Your phone thirsts for battle!<br><br><b>Features:</b> <br><br><b>1. Classic MOBA Maps, 5v5 Battles</b> <br>Real-time 5v5 battles against real opponents. Fight over 3 lanes to take the enemy&#x2019;s tower. 4 jungle areas. 18 defense towers. 2 Wild Bosses. Complete reproductions of classic MOBA maps. Full-on 5v5, Human vs. Human battles. A triumphant return to genuine MOBA gameplay.<br><br><b>2. Win with Teamwork &amp; Strategy</b> <br>Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team or be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!<br><br><b>3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory</b> <br>Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Winners and losers are decided based on skill and ability on this fair and balanced platform for competitive gaming. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.<br><br><b>4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master</b> <br>With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target sifting allow you to last hit to your heart&#x2019;s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system lets you focus on the thrill of battle!<br><br><b>5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches</b> <br>Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds, and battles last 10 minutes, glossing over the quiet early-game leveling up and jumping right into intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling action and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.<br><br><b>6. Smart Offline AI Assistance</b> <br>In most MOBAs, a dropped connection means hanging your team out to dry, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&#x2019;s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you&#x2019;re offline, your character will be controlled by our AI system to avoid a 5-on-4 situation.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE! Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money. If you do not want to use this feature, please set up password protection for purchases in the settings of your Google Play Store app. Also, under our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you must be at least 12 years of age to play or download Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.<br><br><b>Contact Us</b> <br>You can get customer service assistance via the [Contact Us] button in the game to help you with any problems you may encounter while playing.

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

Hope they fix it or I'll have no choice but to uninstall. Not keeping a game I can't play do to some unprofessional error on the games part",

However anyone who wants to play a final fantasy game, but find that the amount of things you can do and how to do these things is overwhelming, then this is the game for you. Nice mix of old school graphics and slightly more modern 3d graphics, good storyline and funny dialogue. Big fan !",

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

Aces, review by Da1 G Reaper of the Sun Tzu Ghosts Gaming Community... #livfreeplyhard #STGGC",
        "Good luck in this game if ya don't want to spend money. No game balancing meaning a lvl12 can attk lvl  1 with no post attk shield or protection of any kind. Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",
        "Hi A.K server 52. Have been playing for couple of months now and still love the game.just when you think you are on top of things something new comes up. I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

        "I find it a little tricky to navigate sometimes, since it makes my on-screen navigation bar disappear. I like it but maybe I would like it more if there was a back arrow? Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",
        "Really disappointed. I played the party game to win the St Patrick's badge. I came 2nd place when it finished and ift said I had won a badge but it doesn't appear in my badge collection. Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. 😟",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",

My wife bought \"180\"  twice thinking she may have made a mistake the first time and only ended up with about 300 total. She already had quite a few to begin with. Ripoff!"

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice!

Not to your Facebook account, or Google play game and has problems with it's server. Why any one would spend money on this game until they could at least save stuff is beyond me.",
        "MY STORY OF HUNGRY SHARK  I've been playing hungry Shri since years and I reached my tiger shark.... suddenly it got updated and I lost all my progress and returned to the first level of reef shark...I was so disappointed and uninstalled the game after a few months I reinstalled it and while playing I saw the cloud save and clicked it.....I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD RETURN TO MY PROGRESS....I enjoy playing it and I love the new background and updates  Best wishes- A hungry shark fan",
        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "It's mindless fun and the soft gore while eating a human is fun. The underwater scenes are visually pleasant. I also like the feature that warps you to the North Pole once a day. The random vortexs that throw you into space are also a really fun feature."

Either the makers of the game are idiots or the game is stupid and seriously 2000 per month for an imaginary egg everyday that cannot guarantee a 4 or 5 star bird. Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",
        "I did not expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I have. The frequent events are nice and having a guild just makes them better. I don't feel compelled to be social be because there is no chat, just playing the game. It is a wonderful balance.",
        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "Decent game, lots of fun to keep you coming back. I would of rated a 4 star game but every time I need to watch a video the game stops working, stopping me from getting a free premium egg or opening chests!"

        "Pros: funny animations, charming stylized set and character designs. Nice to see Teddie, the bartender and beta Angela. I have yet to meet the other chatacters from the tv series. Comfortable gameplay, not a time hog. Cons: 40gems for an additional host slot in diagnostics was for the que, not simultaneous diagnostic host tests. Game could only be played online. Completing 2 Escalante training sessions don't always get rewarded in daily tasks.",
        "I like the game it's quite engaging but  at some point in the game it becomes limiting because of the 30/30 host cap and it's difficult to get more hosts to combine with the existing ones because there's not enough space. I can't just delete or combine the existing ones just to free up because I need them too.",
        "The Delos installation is taking all daaaaay! Stuck in it! Tech support is USELESS!",
        "The 30 host cap immediately becomes pretty difficult to work around, especially when you need to have duplicates of the  hosts to increase their max level cap/attribute score as well as duplicates of hosts for hat colours. I'm hoping there's a way to increase this later in the game. Also, synthblood is incredibly difficult to obtain especially when you need more to fix higher level hosts. Overall though, the game is pretty generous with currency, so I don't think I've ever ran into a hard building wall that made me think I had to spend money on it to progress further. So far, I'm enjoying the game and looking forward to the updates",
        "The host cap of just 30 is a real problem because it becomes difficult to rank up higher level hosts. I would love to continue playing but the cap is a dealbreaker. Hope you can fix this asap",
        "Without any explanation, my level 25 account couldn't be logged in for several days now (I've tried using different wifi and different devices, but still couldn't log in). I spent SO MUCH TIME and effort in achieving everything, and yet all of a sudden you'd lock me out of my account like this. I am gravely disappointed, and I hope you could fix this issue."

        "This game is good and the story was interesting. The reason why i give three stars is because the magic challenges sometimes need to consume lots coins or lunes. And everytime there is new event which need to collect bonbon... It is teally hard to collect it and instead we need to buy... i know this game is free for both pay to play and free to play... but all i see is pay to play since the bonbons need to buy and sometimes events that come back by popular demand also consume lots of money.... I actually liked this game but since you made this game really.... i had to give only 3 stars since the game had to use mk ey A LOT....",
        "Rather then an actual chapter as in some other games, game play is only a page in a normal book if you are lucky. I love the story lines but I would actually love to read the story and not be teased with a tiny blurb of the chapter instead. Maybe if the chapters were longer and worth buying tickets for I would actually spend more money on this game bc it's very cute.   Trying to play threw the stories are so annoying! You need sooooooooo many story tickets! The chapters should be longer per ticket.. it takes like 15 tickets to get threw a chapter! The only good part is u get 5 a day unless u buy more.... please make the chapter length longer per a ticket :( I'd like to actually read a story..",
        "I loved it , it is so addicting and the characters are gorgeous, but it is way too short. I find myself paying fake money from the game to buy tickets just to know what happens next! You might actually fall in love with the characters! That's how amazing it is!",
        "This is my favorite app and has been for almost a year. The only problem now is the adds they can get very frustrating and angering. I do put a lot of money into this game and wish you would consider taking away the adds per player after they put so much money into the game.",
        "I adore this game, I've almost had it for a year now. I chose Klaus and I am head over heels in love with him. I enjoy playing a little bit of his story everyday. The artwork is just beautiful as is the story. It's well written and interesting. However, there's one thing that really upsets me and that's the in game currency,  coins. They're incredibly difficult to acquire. Yes, there's the \"free coins\" but unless you want to spend actual money(which you're trying to avoid obv). The free options that take the least amount of time only give you 7 or 9 coins so good luck with that. Honestly, this game would truly be a 5 star gem if that was fixed. At least bump it up from 7 to 100 and make the offers that cost money actually work. I just did one(it was for a 1$ basically) and didn't get it. Otherwise, thanks for an absolute gem of a game c:",
        "This used to be my favorite Solmare game, but the pop-up ads have ruined it. They can pop open at anytime, playing loud music and ruining the experience. When they pop up, I usually just end up closing the app, no matter what I was in the middle of because they are so annoying. I will probably end up uninstalling this app because of them.  If this was not an issue, it would be a 5 STAR game."

But, there's not enough energy or chances to win energy or earn it. 10 isnt enough!There's times when I'm out of energy and have done everything I can do and have to leave the game but still feel like playing. I've spent money on this game but I don't always have money to buy energy or coins to buy energy. There should be more give-a-ways, prizes, little games, etc to earn more energy so I can keep playing!! Also, I'd like to be able to friend request other players and send them things. Like people on my team on here.  Thank you! Lynn Mauger",

        "Once you loose the shield, you will get farmed by higher level players, forcing you to use whatever resources you have left over to repair. Once you finished repair, you not surprisingly get attacked again. This results you in being frustrated and uninstalling or you foolishly spend your hard earned cash for resources that you will soon enough loose from being attacked.",

Only option I request is warlords events diring the weekend.  Poly and Thor are critcal resources and there never seems to be enough unless you pay for it.",

        "Most missions are 1 to 8 hours long leaving you bored and playing other games. Want to do ANYTHING, it'll take real money but gives you nothing in return. Now events keep expanding and back to back. Only way to advance is money. Went from pay to play to cash cow. They have terrible customer service and just ignore emails and they rigged the game so some missions you have to buy things with real money. And they actually punish good players and there is zero recourse.",
        "It is an entertaining game. The latest update won't let me play the game. It states there's an error with the map and to reload again. 24hrs now and I still can't play it. Also very very jumpy and takes a  good few minutes before it takes action and that was before this update. It looks cool and is more interactive but so much slower and frustrating.  Otherwise it would be PRIMO. Just not quite there yet.",
        "My first game glitched and didn't load the free black widow quest, or the black panther event at level six. Be careful about buying buildings you don't need yet, I had no way to buy Club A and had to start over.",
        "Too expensive at times to get the best rewards and all the goals. Love the concept and game play. Some adventures take a bit long.  Used to love this game. Have spent a fortune on it. Since the upgrade hate the gameplay....not that I can play anymore. Since the hulk event the game comes up and then crashes.  Give me my thousands of dollars and hours of time back, since it's now useless to me.",
        "After recent update game is not starting. As it is not working just uninstalled. Installed game as new event has started. I thought developers sorted out the issue. But after starting the game it downloads around 500mb data and stopped working. Wow what a beautiful new event.after new update & bug fix still game not opening.23 March still app is not working.",
        "So, a lot of problems have been fixed and now it's actually enjoyable and fun to play again. Thank you very much. Just a thing left to change, please lower the price for Ranking a character to 5, 20000 credits are hard to get, maybe 10000, or 15000 as well. 😀"

        "This is the best game i could find on the app store, me being a fan of space x and NASA this is amazing! But however the microtransactions changed the game for me. I feel like everyone should get access to these parts, but however those can purchase the premium version of the game cam get early access, supported the development team and the owner as a lot of great work goes into this game, and you only need a few minutes into the game to show how much detail is put in.",
        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though."

Because they use infamy to measure your lv but at the same time you can get infamy even when you die in the first seconds of a match. In that way you are obligated to face strong enemies because your team is good enought to win the battle without you. In that case the game delievers a bad experience for the player.",

OR!  have the fixers pulse gain the ability (training maybe) to stun enemies for like 1-2sec. Same duration as when a Tesla shield is forcefully taken down. (not so sure about the second one, but the first seems good)",

        "Nice Game! At the start its easy, like many players said, but maybe they didnt stick through to further their games,I believe the easy start is needed to build for the later part of the games specially if you are a f2p player. Though being F2P isnt as bad here as it is on other games (speaking from experience). I like thier new updates now and specially the \"sweep\" requirement. Thanks Devs! my only hope is that please make planting/ crops a little easier on us common folks,it gets a little bit tiring to have to press from seed&gt;plant repeat (depending on your available field). Anyway, besides this i do not regret playing the game, easy controls, f2p friendly, graphics is good, controls are good. Keep up the good work devs!looking forward to more updates",
        "For the love of God let me grammar check your game...",
        "Very nice and addictive game, i like it.  Would be nicer if pvp is already availble",
        "Nice game. I just hope more free diamonds to be given during quests :)",
        "I love the game but what happened to pk cus you guys are an different company",
        "Downloaded the game just to see LoL heroes like Ahri and Sona on action only to found out most of them in preview screenshots doesn't exist in-game. But overall a fun game and f2p friendly.  Edit: upped my rating to 5 after 5 days playing, you guys deserve it. Keep up the good work. :)"

        "Some issues. Like *Seven Knights has stopped working* is probably my phone specs is freaking low. Also, I can grt my 1,000,000 gold from logining in for 14 days. It was from the newbie reward. But it keeps popping in the game. And I can't get the 1 million or I can't get it off the screen every time I logined the game. For the gameplay, graphics and all, I have to say this is the first game I actually think is more than decent. More than average, the characters are cute where as the art design during chapters dialogue it is really fantastic. About the story it is cool I loved it. And the gameplay, I pretty much liked the grinding systems. Is like if you are impatient, you can buy something. If you are patient, keep grinding and keep earning. So, this game is my 9.5/10",
        "I'll give you 5 stars if you continue the story, not to release unknown hidden masters anymore.. This game is dying and many of my guild members are leaving this game because, you know, you only care about money... you keep repeating your mistakes by releasing hidden masters, seriously who are they? We need stories go on",
        "Won't let me connect to the server unless I'm connected to a wifi or unless I have ALL 5 bars which really sucks. It used to work fine with just 3 bars but now it wont even work with full bars :/ literally can't play it anymore...",
        "Nothing but praise for this game. Was recommended by a friend and I've never enjoyed a mobile game so much. Hours of time can be killed, each of the hundreds of heroes have unique skills with unique effects. Not hard to get the hang of, and has a wonderful pacing.",
        "Latest update broke my google play connection. It just loops back whenever my brother tries to connect to his google play acct in-game. \"Connecting to...\" is all he could see and we needed to close the app to stop it. Moreover, when we get in again, it'll still connected to my google play profile and my game acct. Please fix or please tell me how to fix it.",
        "So just got back playing it again after i lost interest for a bit. Then decided it to try it again and wow its good no prblems so far. Sad i missed some updates and events. But oh well my fault. Other than that 10/10"

Music and voices can get sort of annoying but that's what a volume button is for right?",
        "One of the better rpg strategy games out. There's a ton of things available to do if you run out of stamina. The main currency is diamonds which you can purchase but surprisingly they are not that difficult to acquire in game.  Overall I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed games like Fate grand order, syd story and dokkan battle.",

        "Game is fun. I like the arts of character, well designed but some new arts like Cynthia looks really weird. End game seems alot of harder, and lately requires alot of luck or money to get stuff like skins etc. Still a great game, been playing for over 1 year.",
        "I used to love this game before a few months ago and was having a blast just playing hours on end until the next daily mission. But ever since the update, servers are terribly slow, game always forces out from time to time. Even despite that internet is at a excellent proximity range, the servers are just terrible for some reason which is sad since as an experienced player who been playing and supporting this for over 1 year, it feels as if it's getting worse and worse with each new update",
        "This game has not fixed the commercial issue. Still illegal. Plus the loading screen is taking forever and it seems they did not like my last review so they deleted it."

        "I absolutely love the story line and I've spent more on the game than I'd like to admit. But spending money doesn't really get you much farther because the energy goes so quickly. I think you would get far better reviews and more happy customers if you got rid of the energy system and upped the ads for more revenue from that standpoint. Then you could keep the micro transactions for the secret scenes. This way you'd still be making money,  but your customer retention would go up. I have so many ideas that would help this app out and I'd love to share them as I love this story. If you are interested in what I have to say please reply",
        "I love the game. Wish we didnt have to pay for every secret scene and had a little bit more energies before having to wait for more or buy some. Would be great if we had more options for free energy. Love the story and characters. Hurry with season two already!!!  Im anxious to see further stories on ryan and the character Lol ❤.",
        "It's really a good game. It's awesome! But that energies are my main problem! Don't you think that...... only 300 energies that means only 30 lines are not enough and too little for a day..!?..!???!.. and 10 energies per line isn't too much!!??! Please make it down to 5 energies for each lines...and only for dialogues.. And if you give 500 or 100 energies (if 1 line cost 5 energies then there will be only 100 or 200 lines. Not much for a whole day!!!!!) and take 10 hours to get free energies again then the game will be perfect!! Everyone can't buy energies (including me)! You know! Please consider this case sympathetically.!.!..  I beg you.....!....",
        "Lovely story line... love story that keeps you coming back everyday.... at times we are urged to buy energies.. however the energy provided gives sufficient dosage of the story each day... sad that it's going to get to the end...  And i wish I could go back and re read certain moments which is not possible.... apart from it.. this is amazing...",
        "Great storylines!!! Great graphics!  However the energy to even do one chapter is way too low!!!  There should be more choices in filling up the energy.  Let your veiwers choose to watch more ad's or something similar to games where each day you can have one chapter and keep the secret moments as a paid option.  I myself would  have more of my friends play,share and even buy if the cost wasn't $100+ for ten chapters!  Oh and FYI check your editing just a few hiccups in a few clips.   Huge fan on the writer/authors...  Very steamy!! Sincerely JR",
        "This game is misleading. You can only play the \"secret scenes\" if you pay, but the wording makes it sound like your choice so you keep playing in hopes you can see one. And the secret scenes I assume are the ones which actually push the relationship forward. The game staggers and is deeply misleading."

I end up having to close the game and never get to see it, then I go into the next Chapter not really knowing what's going on. The story is important to me and it's very unfortunate that this is happening. A fix from the developers or a suggestion on something I can do would be greatly appreciated.",

Don't like waiting the 4 hours to regain energy and I would gladly watch ads to be able to fill my energy. It would be nice to have a larger expansion area while needing the same requirements. Love the speciality collections!  Great job!",

And also, pls add some advance tactics like 'Tiki-taka', 'gegenpress', 'false nine', etc just like what you guys did in PC/PS PES 2018",
        "I want to make comments what happened with my team if i compared with other team: 1. The passing is worst, my opponent is batter then mind 2. My players seem not to jump to challenge the opponent if the ball on the air 3. The development of the players are taking time..until 30 of age they only reach 90..its to late",

My Asus Z500m should handle it with ease yet I find myself frustrated with problematic behaviour from the game. Fix this. I've been sending feedback for months and nothing has been fixed.",
        "Who made that script, for mobile games it has been the most exciting sports game. I must say it is very complicated specially in the starting but you get addicted to it just for its complications but love to be a manager.. Well done not easy to create such a difficult so deep kind of script.",
        "Let me start by saying awesome game, great graphics playing on and off for years but what's is going on with this game play. Defenders literally running by ball carrier, ridiculous passes by my team and missing clear scoring opportunities. Slowness of my team, no attacking effort, no tackling effort, keeper not even stopping a single shot. Guess I need to just stop playing again. Overall good game just work on the gameplay and AI decision. Uninstalling."

        "I used to play this game and it never gave me the option of saving before and it still doesn't. That was over a year ago. I love this game but when I had to get a new phone I had to start all over, so I didn't play for a long time. I just recently redownloaded it and it still doesn't have a save option. When are you going to change that? I play one of your other games and it has a save option. When are you going to give this game a save option because I have mentioned it before and nothing has changed. I want to keep playing but I would also like a Google play save option in case I have to get a new device.",
        "This is a great app. It has great graphics and doesnt make up anything from the actual show like other games do. My little sister is just crazy for this game. She even pursuaded her friends to get this game! Amazing game, no flaws. Definetly worth 5 stars!",
        "I like this game. But there's a bug. When I try to watch a video to play a mini game for free, the video freezes but the pop up ads don't freeze.... It doesn't make sense.  Why add pop up ads when we're already watching them for the free mini games.  At first I couldnt put this game down, I became addicted, but since the bug started to happen, I started to lose interest.",
        "I'm not sure what happened but my game reset. What also stinks is my game used to be glitchy when I'd leave the game a day later and come on, not even two seconds passed in the game. If highly suggest to stay on online mode since that seems like the only mode that keeps time",
        "This is bullcrap! This is the second time this game has all of a sudden stopped working and I cannot get back in to play. I am soo disappointed that you keep letting this happen!! I seriously could use some HELP!!! Please FIX this issuse immediately!!! I want to continue to play MLP... :'(",
        "I will give this game 5 stars if u can get some help.  When ever I try to open my inbox to look at my shards or collect the hearts I have been sent,  my game just crashes. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game,  playing offline,  clearing the cache data and almost everything else I can think of. Also when I try doing anything with twilight I can't do any tasks, plus I can't find twiligr either.  Please help me. I love this game. But I may stop because it keeps crashing"

The developers will swipe your gold away (basically your money) and give an excuse that your bank or Google issued a refund. After showing and providing evidence that your never received a refund...they do nothing about it! Straight run around. And good luck talking to support..generic responses like the one they give on here.",

        "Love this game  I just wish you got more than 1 or 2 power ups for completing challenges.  I also think the feather rounds should be more often.  Love going back levels to see if i can get the feather.   Coin packages need to be more attractive if you want people to spend real money and tbe power up packages are way too expensive. Still....... i love the game",
        "Well did love the game not now as it's taken me a long time to get off one level even brought more coins just to get. Only just now finished the last one I mean really come on now. Wat a joke  This why I've given a low rate",
        "I'm addicted to the game. The only problem is that you are not given power ups that you earn. I spend good money paying for power ups so, I would like to get the ones that I earn for finishing levels. Thanks.",
        "Previous Connect with FB, Then it's up to level 1100 with coins I have 253 .. But when I invite friends In FB, my level back to 744 .. And I am disappointed",
        "Game coins are very expensive and you don't get much unless you spend the money for the $99.99 package I got better things like clothes and bills and a few new additions to my home before I'd spend it on this game that's for sure💵💵💵😣😣😣😣",

        "Matt seems like kind of an asshat in Season 2. She should just dump him. Could do way better. Like with Daryl perhaps? He obviously cares for her wayyy more than Matt does. Matt only has eyes for Lana. Like he says he loves our girl? I don't think so. I wish you could choose somebody else to date.",
        "Energy is too short & there isn't anything other than a side game for 100 more points to keep you entertained. The app is basically a story with a couple of nice artistic pictures.  Way over priced. You can buy a book for less at Barnes and Nobles and still get twice the amount in content. The the amount of money they ask for engery in this game is ridiculous. Don't be silly  and spend money that you can do better with. Just play for free or not at all.",
        "I think it's a good game but... Let's be fair you don't get to play for long each day before you run out of energy and have to wait 24 hours and even then it's only a few minutes play.... The lack of play time makes me loose all interest in what I believe might be a decent game",
        "So. This is an addictive store. The main characters are very well thought out. A few Grammer error and hick ups in game play. Although this game can be expensive if you don't make the right choice. I had bought the same secret scene twice and it still asks me to buy it. This is the second time this has happened. All in all great game.",
        "I find it aggravating that your energy goes down so fast. You get a few seconds of free play per day. I've paid to get more. But I can't and won't keep doing that when even paying for extra doesn't last long. 😒"

There isn't anyway to contact tech team to fix. It will not open. Please fix, hopefully I haven't lost all my coins, because I can't load this app.",
        "Ok as I am considered a VIP player on this app, the reply from developer should be a pretty good indication of what your in for with this game. I have purchased enough to know that what use to be a pretty good slot has become excessively greedy. I don't mind supporting an app but this one keeps getting worse.",

That's any machine you play you've been warned. 2.5 million coins played 8k per spin same machine never hit the scatter..  85% of wins less than bet ..  Beware !!!",

        "Used to be one of the best time management games available but they no longer fix the glitches.  There hasn't been any updates or new venues for a long time so think the game is being phased out. The game is free but you do need to buy gold with hard cash to progress. No longer worth downloading, my advice is to find something else to play.",
        "It is an awesome game. It is very addictive and I feel very invested in it. If you don't want to spend any of your real money to buy gold, you sure don't need to. It takes a hell lot more to get everything you want but it's still playable. It has some bugs, sure, specially regarding your wireless connecting but it's nothing major. The levels are really hard sometimes but makes up for the good challenge. Thanks, devs, for the awesome game",
        "I love this game. I play it almost everyday. The only thing I don't like is when you spend your supplies to play even when you win you still lose those supplies to play instead of keeping your supplies so you can continue to play on. Other then that. It's amazing. So download this app and have some fun today, tomorrow, or whenever you have some past time. Thanks Chef Ramsay.",
        "I love the game. But there's some bug issues like   1) login to claim 10golds - didn't happen. Where'd the gold? 2) now I can't even login to social. It keep loading, then kinda leave it at that.   I would rate it 5 stars once this is resolved. It's really getting on my nerves.",
        "Game could be cool but has way too much stuff crammed into the tiny screen of most phones. Graphics need to be simplified so that you can see things easier. Overall, the game freezes and crashes every time I try to play. Spend more time making this game stable and easy to see and it might be more fun.",
        "Up until five days ago I wasn't having any problems with this game and I played it nearly everyday. Now I can open the app but nothing happens when I click on any part of the game. This has kept me from being able to do anything with the game for nearly a week. I've missed out on events and opportunities to move up on leaderboards. Please fix the app. I enjoy the game and I don't want to lose progress because of a technical error."

Be warned, it's not the game it was and until it steps up on customer service, I wouldn't put any money into it.",

I'm sorry, but when I play something off and on for roughly half a decade, then I'd like for the app to work so I can retrieve my account. Fix it, and I'll change my review because I really do love this game.",

        "Cost of everything in the game is particularly high. And gems??? Don't even get me started.  They just dropped some limited time dragons in the game, and the cost of EACH them is OVER $100 if you haven't been able to earn that many gems in game yet.  Which takes a very, very long time.  Uninstalling today, casual players beware.",
        "Very relaxing game. I wouldn't say it's a \"time killer\" because after playing for hours you'd probably spend a lot of cash out of your pocket, if you don't want to pay this game calls for lots of patience. If you have PATIENCE you will NOT have to buy anything. I've been playing for almost 2 years now and I have only spent 30$ on the game and not because I felt like i had to but because I just wanted to; to speed the game play up a bit. I have gotten every dragon so far, even the event dragons, and limited time dragons, etc. Without  having to spend any gems. Sometimes it takes days of breeding the same pair but it will work if your persistent and patient! :)",
        "Concept-wise the same as with many breeding games. It's fun, a nice game to have for here and there.  Generally good ideas were implemented into this game. Most dragon designs are really good. Unfortunately I don't understand some of the mechanics in the game like removing something from the market makes you lose this item? I mean the last time I have opened a market on the street, I kept my things I put for sale. :? Please fix those logic flaws.",
        "It's fun enough if you don't take it too serious. I could write a long review but I was in the middle of playing when the game kept asking for a review, kind of annoying. But in all honesty this is one of two games I have consistently played for a long time now, so I really do like it.",
        "I really love this game...i have this one and the other DragonVale. I have alot of fun with my grandkids breeding the different dragons. I will say tho that I would have given this 5 stars all the way across if it didn't take so long to get some of the dragons. We have been trying for the Knarr dragon for months and can not get it. It is very frustrating. If it wasn't for the new events that give us a chance to breed new dragons I am afraid I would have uninstalled this due to it taking wayyyyyyy to long to breed certain dragons.",
        "I've been playing this game for a LONG time. And it continues to keep my interest! It's so fun! And with the constant release of new dragons and events, it stays fun. I wish there were more events, but Hey! It's a great game! Expand that market place though..."

We battle to take the lead and to see who has the most chips! It's a fun and exciting way to keep in touch with her. Thanks for this game/app!!  Sincerely,  Long distance daughter & Mother 🤓",
        "Fast paced game and love it! Chances to keep getting extra coins and bingo credits by watching the short video or I found out by playing lower levels you had completed to play them again to get more of what you need! The higher levels you go you need more bingo credits so this works to your advantage! Great game and love it!",
        "I really like this game as you get plenty of credits to play and alot of games to choose from. The only thing i didnt like was that i was in the middle of playing a bingo game and i lost internet connection and i didnt get my credits back from that. Other games on other sites if something happens when you are playing a game such as getting a phone call or losing connection you will get your credits all back for that game.  I just wish there was that option on here",
        "never gives your bonuses after watching videos.  when trying to get your daily bonus and others it plays a video before you can get them. then gets hung up on boot after you close out.  have to reboot game every time and it still does the same thing.  fix updates please. Not getting keys for watching videos",
        "I  like Bingo. I don't like all the ads! If you want me to click on an ad I would appreciate  something in return, like credits or coins. There used to be an option of buying 3 power ups for 500 coins, now I have to click on an ad. Or buy 4  FOR 1000 COINS.  I ALSO NOTED THAT YOU ONLY GIVE BONUSES AT NIGHT, . People like me also play in the daytime.",
        "Never seen such bad cards. It's way too hard to bingo. You get set and wait for 40 numbers and you still don't win. You may not get to daub your first number until the game is over. Not much fun"

Just another jackass casino. Plus I have no interest it waiting for this clunky piece of junk to load. Garbage. They could care less about your entertainment, they just want your money. Still a pile of manure.",
        "Just like every other online slot game, you start out winning big, lots of scatters and bonuses, but then comes day two when the wins stop and the loosing begins. All they want is for you to start sending your real money to buy their play money. The daily bonus on this game is pathetic. If you collect the daily bonus every day and save up for a month straight, you would probably be able to play for an hour or so.... That's If you keep your bets small.",

        "It SUCKS! This is the biggest joke of an online casino.  Bet high and you lose every single time.  Hell, bet anything and you lose.  I have so much better play at a real casino where I actually win.  They randomly turn off features effectively shutting games down.  People need to be investigated.  Their rating of a 4.3 is a complete lie.  Every one I know rates this app 'bad.'   Every game on here plays worse than at a real casino!",

Still love the game, easy to strengthen Pokemon as you battle and keeping it interesting with every update.  But that's only if it works",
        "Edit: the app has been getting worse and worse. There are a ton of problems with matchmaking, and pay to win is the way now. They refuse to fix the major problems in this game. Plus they just added a new terms of service that states they aren't responsible for those problems with the game. One of those things could result in you losing all the progress on your account or the account completely.",

My Pokemon have a Miss space of 1 and somehow hit it EVERY SINGLE TIME?!?!?!?! I don't think so homie. Spinner is rigged so don't play if you actually want to be the very best there ever was because the computer will not let you. Game is full of bots that just so happen to have the perfect team to beat you once you start doing well"

In a game that involves the collection of various characters, it can be disheartening to spend money on this game and still not get the tsum tsum you want,  even during the so-called \"lucky times\". I recommend keeping your money in your wallet since it is unlikely that you collect the ones that you want, when you want them.   There is also a minor glitch in loading the game, but if you try multiple times, it will eventually load.",

        "I love your games. The graphics and controls are great and I would give it 5 stars but the gameplay is rediculous.  You cannot keep any credit regardless of how many you have and that is very frustrating!!  My game is over as soon as I begin almost.  I \"might\" get to play for 10 minutes but that's only if I get lucky and fix a game that's winning right from the beginning.  I have even purchased credits several times and that has only made it worse!  I cannot keep purchasing credits for a game that only wants to take and doesn't last, nor should I have to.  Please work on this issue because other than that, you have a phenomenal system and I'm going to try to be patient and hope I get to see a difference.    Thank You!",
        "Game not playing , its up to date but no updates available so i can get my daily credits which is 7plus day in if it doesnt sort itself by midnight it will take me back to day 1 im not impressed",
        "I love the game and want to play it all the time everything is great accept the credits i can only play for a couple of minutes because i always run out of credits as soon as i start its very hard to win anything to keep playing and i never get bonuses or scatters i understand losing is part of it and that fine the excitement build when i see two of the scatters or bonus icon come up but never get the 3rd for some reason.",
        "Its a great way to spend your time when you are bored. Love that I can collect credits every hour, and the games give you good payouts.",
        "I play it all the time.Before work, lunch time,bed time. Wish we can get more money.Just love the cats,,do you have one on dogs.. keep up the good work..:-) Hello it me again Vanessa just want you to know how much I appreciate the blue dragon I love making money with him.",

So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says \"combo broken\" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!",

Now its TOO hard to gain coins to open cars and much exciting tracks.. no updates on additional tracks.. think the optjons should be reviewed. Its now once you get where you are the only way to gain more is to go online to TRY and get coins to get anywhere... which sucks!!!!!",

I played this game with a lot of people.  It was my favorite ga   me.  Want to play again!!!!                            It now works but you started me over and took all my life's I had saved up.  I was on level 700.  I used to really like this game and played it every day.  I hope I don't have to delete this game because I am not starting over!  Put me back where I was with my life's!",

When you ask for help they will always 1st ask \"is this the most updated edition\", even if you already told them you game is on automatic update. Its a good game, just frustrating to deal with",

        "Love this game but when you are competing with SWGOH for mobile SW content I expect it to be better end game and more Special events. At lvl 8 and there's no more rewards or incentives , so I guess I'm done.   Also, As a busy person I have limited time to play and taking the entire game offline for maintenance, like right now is not a good way to keep me interested.  Dumb move devs.   Edit: good job with update but still need light and dark missions past level 7",
        "You should be matched with someone in your Tier, not 4 Tiers above you. When you play against fellow Guild Members you shouldn't have your levels edited. There should be an option to leave matches during the match. It doesn't make sense to lose because you had something else to do. And here's my biggest problem \"Oh hey, you won that match, here's 30 points.\" \"Oh you lost that match? Lemme just have 51 points from you.\" It also doesn't make sense to have heroes with blasters against melee heroes. They end up at a disadvantage.  Fot example, I was just matched with a level 3 Kylo Ren, as a level One Padme. Sooo fair.",
        "First the unbalance between the factions. Now the match making.. Are you folks fckng serious about it? Your matching a lvl 11 to 13 or 14? How could I win with my lvl 10 troops vs lvl 15 troops? No matter which side I play.. I have a lvl 3 hux and your great system matches me to a lvl 5 anakin with lvl 13 af walkers? Tell me this is a joke.",
        "Won't let me put cards down at mid Battle again and again. Connection will slow you down not your opponent it seems run into this issue way to much. Then issues like won't let you move or play anything but energy goes up",
        "Absolutely love this game. As a life-long Star Wars fan this ticks NEARLY all of the boxes. However, there is one thing that bothers me, hence the \"nearly\". And that is the matchmaking. I'm in tier 5 division 3, and for some reason it decides to pick a person from tier 7 division 2. Of course, I lost because it's unfair. Please sort this out.",
        "My favorite game on mobile right now. It's a mix between a MOBA(League of Legends)  and Clash Royale. You control a hero AND manually deploy different troops in your lane. I've never spent a dime and own all the heroes in game so it is not really pay to win at all. All around great game."

        "Brings Back Fond Memories I love this game! I spent countless hours playing this in the early 2000s. The controls are easy enough to understand and the text is legible on my LG V10. I don't if I'd be able to read it on a smaller screen, they are not kidding when they say this is meant for tablets. If you've got a tablet or phablet I can't recommend this game enough.",
        "A classic perfectly adapted to the phone platform This game is a MUST-have for any rpg lover. The D&D mechanics may seem i bit weird in the beginning, but you will learn in time. The replayability value of this game is almost infinite. Personally I have never played any kind of game that would allow me to play as many hours in so many different ways. The game excels in its easy to handle mechanics, fun dialogue, compelling story, great ammount of side-quests that are actually enjoyable. Hands down best Apk for this platform. Worth every penny.",
        "Great Classic CRPG BGII was definitely a breakthrough in its time, but it still holds charm and depth that many newer games can't even touch. I have this game for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and I can tell the chip set on the phone is grinding gears with the games engine. It's playable but only when the right character menu is minimized but it still gets choppy when multiple spells are being  cast. With the specs on the s7 this shouldn't be the case. Hey Developers any input/ advice on how to solve this issue?",
        "Amazing! There's a lot to love.  First, if you played the original, this is just as good with extras.  Granted, it's a bit harder to see everything, but it's what happens when you take a computer game and make it available for a phone.  Beamdog has brought additional characters, adventures, magic items, portraits and voices to the game to expand the character creation.  Some expansions are dull (like the arena unless you love grinding) but more of this rpg is on the way.  It's truly the best classic game reborn.",
        "I have a special request. I have purchased very possible version of the bg series, and have played as long as the game has existed. Call me a war vet asking for a wheel chair ramp but could you guys implement the imput of  points or the option to roll. 20+ years of rolling for stats has earnt me the option. Other than that perfect game, worth every licence for every platform. Either let us input stats with option to roll or make a shadowkeeper for android please.",
        "Game is great, as I've played it on another device. However on Note 8 it does not take up the whole screen, and the usable screen is significantly smaller than on s7 edge, and is barely playable. When I force it to full screen in settings, then touching on sides of screen are not recorded accurately. For example, when I try to resize the text box, it toggles AI instead. Makes the game virtually unpayable."

        "Great game",
        "not sure about the rating questions. Complex as in difficult? No. complex in features, absolutely. simple as in boring? heck no. but easy to learn and play. very straight forward and relaxing which is what i look for in a game. graphics are stellar. game advances relatively quickly. have seen no glitches or issues so far. i'm only at level 2 or 3 so can't say how difficult it will be over time. if you like hidden objects games, you should like this one.",
        "Could not possibly be more of a money grab. There are about four different internal payment systems, but no interchange between them. You can get more by paying CASH MONEY NOW or by waiting until enough time has elapsed for some of them to have increased. If you're looking for something you can play for more than 15 mins, forget it. If you've run out of time in the crystal matching game, you can watch ad's to get bonus time - except when this crashes, so it loses your progress and the cost to get into that level. And then there's the assignments which appear on your list, but aren't available to you until you've gone up three more levels. Utterly pointless and incredibly frustrating.",
        "This is a really good game but I have to agree with other players that the game crashes a heck if a lot and you will find that you pay for items that you never receive. I have contacted them on two occasions about this and fair to say it was sorted. However the last time this happened (about a week ago) I tried to report it but it would not allow me to submit my complaint. Players beware.",
        "I downloaded and played for a couple of levels. Suddenly it told me to download more things. No choice in the matter. Then it wouldn't download. Over an hour waiting and it hadn't gotten past 2%, then suddenly it went back to zero!",
        "Because you have to purchase so many items to actually play the game, its disappointing to say the least!  I'm thinking I may have to uninstall it soon!  If they would consider changing it so you didn't have to purchase items for everything, I may consider keeping it!  Otherwise, it sucks, its no fun to play!"

        "I'm so addicted to this game! Out of all the simulation games I've played this is by far my favourite. The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don't have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it's worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.",
        "I LOVE this game, and everything about it is awesome, aside from the fact that I just got a new phone and now the time is correct on it (my old phone clock was an hour off), and daylight savings time just happened so while my new phone time is an hour later, my game won't let me play due to the time change. It says I need to go back to my previous time zone (which I haven't moved anywhere, its just daylight savings time). I've already put a suggestion up on your site asking about whether you guys can put an option to change the time on the game for these very situations, or to install a daylight savings time option so it can keep up with real time. Other than that though, I absolutely love the game, the graphics, the game play, and the characters to which I get so attached to, are stunning and beautiful. Y'all should be really proud of yourselves &lt;3",
        "Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it's a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won't be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)",
        "Loved it overall but make the chats last longer without having to reset them as I miss them with school or sleep. Not everyone can use the app at certain times in the day. It doesn't have to last the whole day just a few more hours  or 10. The games good other than that though. It's a good way to pass the time and has a good story.Keep up the good work.",
        "Im in love wih the characters already! Though, its kinda sad that you are forced to be a girl character even if you state that you arent in game. That kinda took me out of the experience a bit. I understand it would probably take a lot of effort to put that option in, but man would it be cool. Keep up the great work!",
        "I've been a long term fan now since 2016 when it came out and I still play it to this day! The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to! I have been in love with Saeran since the Common Route so him getting his own route was like a dream come true! Although, his route is an emotional roller coaster.."

        "Awesome game if u love strategy & buissness tactics with football......plz upgrade the game play in exhibition or others game play into 3d & give a weekly basis youth squad facility....fans need it...& love it",
        "Surprisingly deep experience. I suppose the obvious comparison would be to Soccer Spirits. This is a lot more grounded in reality (there's a lot less talking rabbits and little girls who can do magic), but there's more to do. There's also a dry cleverness permeating everything.  UPDATE: I've hit a weird and frustrating wall--the game isn't clear about when its days roll over. I guess it might be UTC (there are several indications that the game originates in the UK), but for a few days, my daily quests were rolling over at midnight Pacific Time (like most of these games that punish players for not playing every day), but today I noticed that there doesn't seem to be ANY consistency regarding when daily quests begin and end. Anyway, I'm docking two stars (I otherwise believe that this is a five-star game) until the game's daily rollover time is clarified. I had a nice streak going, that the game's failure to communicate ruined.",

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "Saw in Facebook and thought I would give it a try. I am now addicted. I love how realistic they make the interaction seem. The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more \"proving innocence\" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn't not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend",
        "I really like this game!  The game feels so real. The text messages you send out and get are from your actual time! Oh to make the game more interesting...you go to the dial tone dial 893702 the erase it don't hit call. At the bottom it will say chat, settings, etc. Click on those then go back to dial tone and repeat. This will give you more \"money\" to buy more lives and stuff. This really helps make the game more interesting! I am currently addicted :)",
        "I've been playing this game off and on for ages, I love the storyline to it and the interaction with the other characters - the only thing to make that better would be if we could submit our own responses rather than the two choices given. The puzzles I like, but it would be interesting to have different types of puzzles rather than the same one repeatedly.  Got to the witness protection part of the game and it has frozen on me. I have collected all stars but no interaction is coming up on the text screen so not sure what to do next!!",
        "I left a negative review at first before uninstalling it. After a few days or so, I deleted the review and decided to give it another chance and installed it again. So glad that I did! Now I love this game. I find it interesting with the storyline as well as the puzzles. It does leave me curious about how I'd react or what I'd say if it was real instead of a game. I was hoping to get it on another device, but this game isn't compatible with it. Thank you for this game! I ended up having to start the game all over again since I had to factory reset my phone, so this is 2 reviews in one. I love this game and it's very addicting to me since I'm addicted to it. Even after I get all the goals completed with the puzzles, I still want to continue. Love the storyline since it keeps my interest. Thank you for creating this game for all of us to continue to play and enjoy.",
        "This game is great. It's my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It's so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.",
        "I absolutely love this game but I had something glitch to where I have all my messages but the block buster game said I've only completed the first set of puzzles when I was actually on probably the sixth or seventh. I tried playing along thinking it has to do with someone hacking my messages in the game but to no avail. I'm considering uninstalling and reinstalling I just don't want to go that far back and have to start over with how slow it is to progress. Please help!"

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",

The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",

        "Literally unplayable. Game pauses itself in the middle of races multiple times. I am nowhere near touching the paise button and even went as far as to place my phone on the ground and touch the phone with only one finger on the accelerate button. SOMEHOW the game pauses itself 7 times during that race. Uninstalling.",
        "It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could \"ditch the glitch\" so to speak. Thanks",
        "So hard to beat the game. I'm not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can't buy anything in shop without real money.",
        "Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win",
        "Been playing for a few years and about to quit because every time I have a lead my bike goes forward by itself and starts glitching. Almost feels like I'm being cheated out of a good run. Maybe it's because I don't pay to play. Please fix or I'm deleting!",
        "The one thing that wrecks the game for me is the little hangup glitches that happen constantly.  You need to be precise to win races, and it's pretty hard to do that when the game is always stuttering.  Running on a brand new MotoZ2 Play, btw."

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "Played this on PC, and really enjoyed it for its simple, quirky playstyle. While it does trail off at the end when you've mastered everything, the entertainment value is still strong. Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "It's an OK game with pretty complex party building mechanics. But, it also has terrible progression that almost pushes you to spend cash if you're not patient.    And the controls...  For a mobile game, the controls is not very responsive, sometimes I decided to drag a character to attack and the game decided to instead move the character forward and switches with the front unit, in a game where formation matters, this breaks the whole system, and so in order to prevent that, you'll have to drag it slowly, so it registers properly   The hit box is also pretty terrible, sometimes I decided to attack but then it didn't register because I didn't hit the right hit box.   Overall the game itself is not bad, but it has slow progression and getting the 5* (which is very necessary especially the raid class item) is very hard, definitely play this game if you are a very patient person.",
        "Problems solved. Thank you",
        "I give this a 5. I'm F2P and the ??",
        "It's can be fun game(for a short)if you are not interested in the competitive aspect. If you want to be competitive you gotta spend a lot of real money because of prestige.Prestige xa give you additionnal stats to your unit.  You need to spend more than 800$ to have every stats bonus only avaible with prestige. You can gain a few prestige every year but they increase the prestige cap faster.  Pvp is boring, from bronze to silver all i had to do is put a tank on capture point to win. And now i have been losing 95% of all of my matches in gold( and i cant fall back i silver even if i only losses)  Guild arent interesting if you arent super powerfull as you do 0.1% of what a big player does.  It takes a long time to even be somewhat strong.  Pve is ok but really short if its the only thing you do.",
        "This game can be spendy but even without buying anything, you can still advance quickly. There are known bugs but it is address very quickly. I definitely enjoy the gameplay and involvement of the whole community to grow your team.",
        "Normally, I don't give freemium pay to win games 5 stars, but this one is different. Basically all the money options are crazily overpriced, but if you put the time in they give you tons of premium currency just for playing. I've been playing for awhile and it hasn't slowed down yet. I just wish they had a decently priced option because I'd like to support the developers, but there isn't really a good option, monetarily, to do that. Everything cheap is lackluster and anything worthwhile is expensive.    If you like tactics games this game can definitely holds your attention for awhile."

        "Had to delete game due to ads popping up when I unlock phone.  If it wasn't for the ad issue, might played longer. It was getting tiresome going down to mine, a cave somewhere in the middle to find to restart a mission, then back to the top to smelt/craft. Then you have the auto mining platforms that are movable but one wrong touch and it resets.   Graphics were great.  There are other game like this, that don't spam ads during nongame play, that are equal or better",
        "Hey wonderful game! Except that I might have broken it...killed the Amber Elder before crafting tesla coil.",
        "its insane how much you have to pay for upgrading digging tools,, uninstallig it after a year playing, sad but true",

Works fine after, but getting tiresome. As is the really pointless nuclear reactor that takes months to fuel for one short run. Weapon upgrades now stupid requirements - latest needs more obsidian than I've mined in over a year.... Get a grip on reality people!",

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

        "Finally a mobile mmo that actually feels like a real mmorpg. Nice graphics, skills, open world questing, lots of players. Fights are engaging  and boss fights are spectacular and interactive. You do need a team for dungeons and raids as you can't just 1 shot everything, like in other mobile mmos. I've tried loads but this is the best by far! Keep it up!",
        "Man, this is a perfect 5/7! Out of a crapton of Mu Origin game clones, this is even better than original! Polished graphics, nice player skills set, awesome UI items layout - everything is top notch! The only thing I can wish for is adding camera turn on top of player strafe via joystick. Thanks for the hard work, and please keep it up!",
        "Great mobile MMO! Good graphics and narration so the story stays interesting. Additionally...SO much Co-op and PvP and a lot of things to give an edge. Not P2P dominated either so far. Obviously the grind to 55 is tough but I have a few characters on different servers there still very possible.",
        "I think this game is amazing for an MMO mobile. It has a feeling of blade and soul and WOW and the graphics sre amazing on my Razer phone! Actually feels like a real MMO, and I like that there are character voices.  Only problem I am having is whenever I go to turn the Volume up or down all sound cuts out and won't come back on until i restart the game. So I need to pre-set my volume before launching the game and then not touch the volume while playing.",
        "Love this games good graphic and updated.  But love warrior in any game but in this game warrior are weak in dps. Can u adjust skill  And i spend real money on top up every week but no legend reforge from bp.  How sad to my char. Legend are to far away to me full set legend. I play evryday not to miss anything on event",
        "Overall game nya seru, story lore nya juga, banyak diversity dalam 1 class, hal yg bikin menarik sebenernya banyak hal yg bisa di laku in di game, ga selama nya soal \"power character\" tapi soal balancing stat sesuai kebutuhan dan juga path yg diambil. sistem dungeon yg berbeda difficulty juga seru a.k.a mythic (jadi inget main world of warcraft), tapi somehow sistem pvp kurang greget 4.5/5"

The worst is even if I change the interface to left handed before a dual the game automatically changed the interface to right hand. And after a dual starts there is no way to access the setting to change to left hand. Please fix it! It's like forcing a left handed person to write with his right hand. I don't play duals anymore because of this problem. And I know if I don't play duals I won't get anywhere in this game. Be considerate please and fix it",

For starters, when I'm in the middle of a duel, it will straight up just kick me off and it will exit the game completely...its very frustrating. Second, why when someone is doing the duel, the opponent gets an extra 20 seconds to complete it?? I have won so many duels but since they get an extra 20 seconds, they tend to beat me when clearly I was ahead when the duel was actually over...please fix this. I really do love this game but it needs debugged to be a badass game.",

        "I'm a big mahjong player and this game is like mahjong on crack. i definitely recommend it to my fellow mahjong nerds. it's awesome with how many levels there are and boosters and achievements and the whole shebang. not just a regular mahjong game where you can only play the game and nothing more. if you like the whole saving up crystals and buying boosters and earning achievements jawn, then you'll love this game. side note, I also have not spent real life money on this game mostly because I don't need to. I usually will buy stuff for games only because I use the money I get from my Google rewards app cause that money goes straight into my Google play account. so it's not that I'm anti spending money on games, but I haven't yet felt like I needed to. it's not one of those where you need to spend money to have it be fun at all (well, not yet anyway! hopefully that won't change) or to be able to get past a certain point. so I totally recommend this to all my mahjong nerd brothers and sisters!",
        "It is a shame that this game allows one to start a new mod and a day or two later sends the player back to the original mod to collect hats, lanterns or eggs. A more polite end to an uncompleted game would be \"Try Again!\" rather than \"You lose!\" This the most rude end that I have seen on any of these games.",
        "So far its good! Just wish you would not link all your games like you do it bogs the games down. And wish you would fix it so that if you had a game several years ago in which you used your email address you could reuse it even if you can't remember your password",
        "A different spin on the classic MahJong game. It's fast-paced  and sometimes it doesn't respond as quick as I  would like. I wish the game would allow just a little more time because it is difficult to see the different levels to find all the matching tiles.",
        "I love this game. However I do have problems with the loading. It says there is no internet connection which is not true. I have fast ADSL and it is connected all the time. Why don't I have problems with other games then? They all work perfectly. Please look into this matter. Thanking you.",
        "I paid 1.99 for 40 eggs and game earned the other 5... and the \"unique prize\" was 5 gems.... I would think it would be something a little more...idk just more. Other than that, the game is awesome. Love the whole idea. Levels, like any other of the \"saga\" games with mahjong."

        "An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It's so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I'm sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/",
        "Elder scrolls legends is a game with a elder scrolls taste and mechanics. Its choices, game modes and progress systems works perfect. It's story is great, and serve as a tutorial for the big part of the game. You can even unlock new dlc and decks through your progress in the game. This is truly a marvelous game. Problems like connection break occurs very rare and does not affect the game. If you like CCG and ELDER SCROLLS, then this game is highly recommended.",
        "Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it's very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done 👍",
        "The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn't know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on \"draft\" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they're putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.",
        "Week 1: *Going to try to make this an ongoing review*. Had to lower this to 4 stars overall, because you have to either pay or grind to access all of story mode. I'm gonna buy it, but I think it shouldn't cost more than $14.99. Just mho. PvP is fun and you actually play LIVE people, not an AI running someone's cards. Level rewards seem generous and worthwhile.  Runs a bit slow, but I know it's my phone and not the app's fault. Gameplay is very fluid and makes sense. I already like it FAR BETTER than Hearthstone.",
        "Fun game! Is very generous with card packs and rewards. Plenty of deck complexity yet easy to get into. The RnG can be troublesome at times, but I guess that's just how card games go. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy card games, specially if you're and Elder Scrolls fan."

        "A great game with unique map designs and user friendly controls, free to play if you have patience and play strategically, pay to win if you want to advance faster. It is especially a good game for busy people like me who can only spend 10-15 minutes per day but need to stay in the game for a large number of days to be competitive. Don't try to use items and gems on every maps, it is fun and challenging to clear them without shortcuts. *Tip for developers*: Instead of giving purchase options for Sethos and Phoenix they could go with Yan and Narlax, gives chance for new players to compete also developers can milk in additional purchases.",
        "Great TD game with decent difficulty and NPCs progression while still maintining a pattern making you work to figure out various strategies.  Ads have never been an issue I honestly cant remember where they are.  I think they may only be for like \"double your rewards for battle\" kind of thing.  90% (A) or better in my oppinion.  Mainly cause I want to see more progression.  Note I am only a few levels in so I dont know if theres a pay to get by an immpassable place yet.",
        "*Updated* SCAM! Games slowly bleeds away your gems without mechanics being apparent. (I lost 300 gems in the last 3 days) Good luck unlocking heroes or content without paying $30-40. -2 stars.",
        "Your game is WAY too hard. I am at level 90+ and found the first 3 worlds great fun and balanced but now you have effectively destroyed the enjoyment factor by making the enemies SO strong that you cannot possibly beat them unless you have max level heroes...and the best max level heroes require so much to level up that without paying an absurd amount of real money you may aswell give up.you have broken what could have been the best game on android with selfish Pay 2 win tactics . Uninstalling after months of enjoyment and gameplay.  You need to fix this and make it challenging but not impossible",
        "It's really addicting, a lot of challenges and puzzles for the towers... really loved it! Good job team!   A bit of improvement: maybe an easier way to access the other worlds would be really good!?"

Battle with Death Knights and fight alongside with knights, dragons, wizard, ice queen, and other ancient gods in the adventure field! <br><br>The forces of evil amass. Why do they march?

No help, and no fun if you enjoy the leveling up your character part. Basically if you want to watch your character bounce around and  not know what's going on then this games for you. To be fair, guess you would pick it up sooner or later ; (",
        "Great game love it, but now we're getting a merge, FWI 4399game don't make all the players go back to level one Plz! No one wants to start over because of merging players! It's not appropriate, and why, again Why do we have to start over! PLZ CHANGE YOUR MIND PLZ! 😢",
        "Like the game but there's a huge problem... there is a hacker trying to portray themselves as the developers using the raiders name from Malaysia. If any of u see an email with the name of raiders game masters report it if u can don't give out info",
        "This auto complete thing can be good, but I don't like how it does everything for you. You don't even play the game, it plays itself and has zero explanation of what to do, just pulls you into different directions. Sorry, if I want to play a game, I ACTUALLY WANT TO PLAY IT!!!",
        "So far so good. An easy game to play while doing other things like watching shows/homework/ect. Lot of people complain about the auto-play. But you can turn it off if you want. I actually like the auto feature. To each his own",
        "Was an awesome game. Now log in is in Korean and can't log in when I only ever used my Google account but now it only ask for my name and password in Korean. Stupid developers and their broken updates. They ruined a great game."

If played for extended period it can be a bit hard going back to a typical match 3 game (like Candy Crush) when you forget to stop sliding!",
        "Addictive and cute! At first glance, I thought it looked childish but after playing it a few days, I love it! Keep up the good work! ❤",
        "Updated 2/2018- well at least we can sorta replay old levels but wouldn't it have just been easier to let us pick which levels we want to replay instead whatever this randomizer thing is doing. This game is infuriating but I can't quit it. At least I have the sense to never spend money on it since there's no advancement.    (old review) You have to let us go back and play old levels. It's really annoying on games where I choose to actually spend extra money, when updates change things like this."

Thank you very much for caring about the people that play your game. Now the only thing I am waiting for is an update so that I have new levels to play.

        "I have not paid a cent for this game, and have never felt forced to. With gradually increasing difficulty levels, the game is never too hard nor too easy. I love the combo of a CCG and a match three that this game has been able to do extremely well.  Not only is the game fun to play but the soundtrack is beautifully composed and the graphics are gorgeously rendered.  If you only want one game on your phone then let it be this one, you will not be dissapointed.",
        "Awesome! This is a great way to entertain the brain! My favorite part is honestly the minigame treasure hunt. So fun!!! Sadly you dont get to play it without Glory.... I don't even care about PvP, but apparently that's the only real option I have to earn Glory and play the minigame... Wish we could get the treasure maps with other in game resources... Or make a second app just for the minigames because theyre super fun...",
        "This game gets better and better with each update. Superb graphics, thousands of possibilities of creating your own unique army, mini-games, guilds... and all of those for free (you don't have to spend a single coin and still be a really strong player). Recommended!   PS. This game is so addictive that should be illegal ;-)",
        "Game is an addictive grind fest! You're always making progress, finding new cards, heading towards guild goals, etc. You can have tons of fun for free, but beware - recent updates are more gem-hungry than ever before. Gems can be earned for free, but not at the rate the game wants you to spend them. Don't feel you have to.",
        "This game sucks! The matching is SOOOO predictable. It goes like this: You move once maybe twice then the cpu goes and guess what. They get like 7-8 moves in a row. Combo after combo EVERYTIME the cpu moves. You don't get the gems you need either. I love jewel games and jewel quest but this game is not the same. Only in appearance maybe. So disappointed. Looks fun. Thought I'd have fun. But it straight up isn't.",
        "Great game that doesn't make u wait for resources to replenish and so far I don't feel like it's pay to win. There's lots to grind for here in a good way. I recommend it. All it needs is some form of instruction. I haven't been able to figure out how the boosts add up. It's been a lot of trial and error."

My last login. I immediately had a tutorial telling me to add my healer to the squad. Which was already added. So, the tutorial forced me to remove her.

        "Easy to pick up and varied game play.  Some of the controls can be a little repetitive but not to the point of distraction.  Keeps you interested and doesn't require a great expenditure of cash if you are a relatively casual player.  Plenty of good themed events.  All in all a good distraction which I have now been playing for almost a year !",
        "I have been enjoying this game very much since I installed it maybe about a month ago. I actually stopped participating in a game that I've been in for 3 years for I find the is more entertaining, better graphics, quick response time on tickets and the community is more open. Highly recommend this game; which I might add is for all ages and gender who enjoy space battles and strategy. Thanks eh",
        "Love this game. it would be nice to know what kind of equipment you are going up against in war like you see when you are in pursuit mode i.e. DT, CR, MS, BS and what kind of weapons and defense. Thanks for the great game",
        "Great game with a large degree of strategy. Unfortunately, recent changes make it very difficult to obtain good heroes without P2P. This is most likely going to erode the free to play player base resulting in a game that is not as fun to play. Hopefully this can be rectified in future updates.",
        "Ooh dear ooh dear how sad,, yes that directed to you again astro-(I've run out of ideas an getting desperate now)-nest.  Just had a login gift (cue fanfare) which was 2 pointless training id's.. Big bloody Whoop. Oh an let's not forget the equally pointless (get your hands in your pockets/debit/credit card rip-off) St Patricks day event. Cue no crystal/AP boosters.. Seriously you jokers should all have stripey shirts on with a little printed card with numbers on attached.. What's truly sad is the games good, possibly even great.. But! Greed as always outweighs the gamers creed.. FYI! I don't expect a reply.. Your preprogrammed bots don't know how to deal with genuine critism, nor do you care either",
        "A very amusing game. It has its flaws, but so do you! :-)  At least give it a try, you won't be dissapointed."

        "MUST READ: If you want to EARN FREE Just👍łnstaII &quot; VEARN &quot; App Enterr (SONA) to Start Earnings So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won&apos;t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It&apos;s also the best exchange rate on points. vEarn points equals vc instead of like some of the others where it takes vEarn points to reach vc etc....Also,👍łnstaII &quot; TOYOCASH &quot; App Enterr (BOON) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Giftz. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "Love it.♡ I love this slot game. But u don't win enough to keep playing u get to play about 5 minutes then you're broke. Nobody can afford  to buy coins every 5 or 10 minutes  playing the games are fun but you only get like 5 or 10 minutes then you gotta build up your coins and it takes about a day or two to do that so its not worth keeping. You have to be rich to play this game. Uninstalling.",
        "I've deleted this app from my tablet library, and finally for good!  I gave this app a second chance, but to no avail.  Same thing still happens when a video ad is played to obtain free credits (and very cheap with the free credits), soon afterwards, no sound is heard throughout gameplay.  Bonuses don't come often enough, nor is winning enough to even get on the plus side of the amount of credits I began with (slot play not loose enough).  Shoot, I get better gameplay with the real slots in Las Vegas!",
        "Slots Cool slots to occupy my time & play. Just dont take it too serious. I reread the fine print. You have to check all the stars in order to get good pay outs & high bonus spins.                Noticing Im not the only person losing out.. I made a good choice when I decided not to spend my cash money on this game. I would have been ripped off like sever other ppl playing. I have have had several different slot games on my devices. This is the 2nd out of 7 tha hasnt did well.",
        "Was fun till you lowered the bonus wheel amount. Then you keep sending me notifications telling me I won 10,000 credits and I never get them. And also I will have like 50,000 credits when I get out of the app and come back to play later and they are gone. Yeah that's fun. I can go to east st louis and get robbed for real if I wanted that."

It is silly to invest an hour into exploring only to lose it all because of an extra click, especially when you have a bunch of telaports. When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",

No logging in at all. Whats the matter with this? I have Fast wifi Network. But still it doesnt logging in. Do Something if you Devs want your game famous. Thanks. Reply ASAP!",
        "It's a decent game. But don't ever think of recharging. Efun just happily merge servers. I was one of the top players until efun decided to merge several servers together. In the end you fall our of all the rankings, couldn't receive any rewards. So what's the point of recharging? It just basically end your fun. It's Super Disappointing. Stay Clear of any games by them. Remember Don't Ever Recharge.",
        "Your game is good with the nice graphics, i like it. But some bug in game u need to check back. And please make sure your server is secure. Because some people using MOD hack with no skill cd and dmg. If u dont make any update for your game.. sorry, i quit.",
        "The game is nice, but be aware that after your first logout, then you can't play any more. Do not want to connect me to my server!  Don't know what is wrong but from the reviews before mine is look like that I'm not the only one!   DO NOT SPEND MONEY BEFORE YOU MAKE IT SURE THAT YOU CAN PLAY IT ON THE NEXT DAY!",
        "So many hackers and bug.. please fix it! Im serious about this game. But if guys dont do any thing to improve it. I guess alot people will leave soon.. 1hit ko no CD for skill. So many hacks. Your bug is more than any game i played. Please fix it..",
        "its a money making game and no way you can be free player. After merge it sucks more as other states got more stronger and like other games bullying started. Dont know it will be fun or just stay scared in a corner or one best option spend more money to stay alive. There are no features for ppl who want to enjoy game with minimum expenses. Some stuff only available for vips."
