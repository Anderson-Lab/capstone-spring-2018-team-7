     [ 'Two words: unlikable ads. Adds pop up befnore you open the game, after at advertises itself, shows another ad, then you get to play, with an add at the bottom. And after your first touch you get another ad that is very difficult not to open. I should have known, it\'s made by ketchapp. Very unsatisfied. They make so much money and adds and put so many so they annoy you into paying them money for less adds. Greedy.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'This skill-based time waster would be better without the hyper-agressive advertising. First you have the constant banner ad at the bottom of the screen. That\'s forgiveable because it\'s out of the way and doesn\'t really affect gameplay. It\'s the fail-state adevertisements that constantly interrupt retrys that will irritate even the most casual of gamers.   The only people writing good reviews for this game are bot accounts.',
       'I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',
       'The game sucks it\'s alwful. It\'s gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!' ],

     [ 'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'Fun game, addactive, enjoyable. However forcing ads on the player after ever 2 hits is out of order. You already let us double our winnings by watching ads so why make us watch them when we don\'t want to? Take that out and add in an option to watch an ad for coins. Do that and I\'ll happily give you 5 stars.',
       'This game seems like it could be a great time waster... If it weren\'t for the whole crashing after every round when it tries to load an ad or when you try to watch an ad to upgrade something for free. I see nothing wrong with having these ads here.... As long as they don\'t affect app stability',
       'To everyone complaining about the ads, quit being so cheap and give the $2.49 to buy the game and remove them. Once the ads are removed, it\'s addictive and fun to keep getting the ball further. Fun concept and well executed. I\'ve already gotten more than my $2.49 worth of fun out of this game, and continue to play it.',
       'One star for the fact that after every single at bat they throw an ad at you. And half you can not skip early. I understand the need for ad\'s but Jesus Christ not after every turn. I normally pay to turn ads off but since the developers wanted to go ad crazy I\'m not paying a cent and just delete.',
       'Too easy of a game. Once u upgrade ur strength to 30 plus you have to take into account of the angles. You never want to hit the ball perfect because it\'s  Impossible to hit the ball flush that it aligns with the dotted lane. Oh yeah for those saying ads, turn off the Wi-Fi and play.' ],

     [ 'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'The game isn\'t bad if you like word puzzles. My dislike comes from the fact that I have push notifications for this app turned off, but it somehow continues to manage to send them. It also keeps poor track of your coins. Good time killer.',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'This is one of the best word games I have ever, when running into a really tough spot not immediately uninstalled. This is a GREAT AND CHALLENGING GAME!!! It really makes you think and it keeps your brain thinking and actively. I love it and will keep it. I am 70 yrs old and just got this game a couple weeks ago and at almost level 300.. This is a keeper!!' ],

     [ 'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'The levels in the game got insanely difficult on the first day after downloading and playing the game. Some of these levels take a days just to beat one and you only get one star which doesn\'t do anything.  I can appreciate that someone from the team responded to what I have to say.   The scarf game makes levels a bit better, when you have the lives to play coninously for an hour.',
       'I gave it three stars because not too far along in the game, it turns into a "pay to win" game. Some boards simply don\'t give you enough moves, so you\'re forced to use coins to continue or retry and lose a life.  I don\'t mind hard games, but I detest micro transactions being needed so soon into it.. I\'m at level 24, that\'s it, and already the board doesn\'t even give you a fighting chance to beat it without using coins.' ],

The only way I could figure out the pass that level was to use the things at the bottom of the screen or the things the page where you choose what you want to put in there in advance. But if you don\'t buy extra coins then you can\'t either had moves or get anything that will help you along. Not to mention that 100 coins per item is a lot of money. When you charge $2 450 coins. I\'m taking this game off my apps.',

If it does not change I\'ll continue to move to 1 star. Games are many to be played...not just stuck on a level forever!  Other issue with the game is that there\'s so much clicking and waiting once you win. I wish that it would just go right to the next level and it wouldn\'t have to wait for the splash screen. I just spend so much time wasted versus playing' ],

It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn\'t take long it\'s a simple engine.',

     [ 'The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It\'s intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it\'s voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.',
       'I love this game so much, but what about more structures? Also I wish there was a chat in game that you can just type instead of voice chat, also the number one thing I wish you guys could add in or fix is the snipers bc they are weak... also I think there should be a counter somewhere when people dismount the plane so we can Dee how much are still in plane and how much already left  That\'s all',
       'good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members\'re 20 players. sorry for my bad english',
       'Loved this game so much! A tip for dev, You guys might wanna try to block/disable cheaters from the game on the next update though. It\'s starting made this game unjoyable to play anymore. Hope you can see my review, thanks for all the effort you gave to us guys!',
       'Dear GARENA DEV PLEASE DETECT THOSE MOD USER AND BANNED THEM ITS UNFAIR TO US THAT PLAY LEGITIMATELY ON THE BATTLEFIELD WHILE THOSE CHEATERS EASILY TARGETING US... ESP-NO GRASS-NO FOG-AIM BOT... IT WILL MAKE THIS GAME FOR GRANTED IF THIS WILL CONTINUED... bad english',
       'More Update Please.  There\'s a lot of things to repair here. Give more attention to the target pointer, sometimes the avatars body cover the pointer and also the enemies. Give more options on how to communicate easily like putting commands and specially on group battles. Some of vehicles are not functional, like trucks. To be realistic game set-up, all things in the game must be functional, except for those cars like junk. Thank you!!! Salute!!! :)' ],

     [ 'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'I like the game, but I have a few things I would like added. One thing is instead of joystick controls maybe there could be an option that allows you to have buttons to move like in vehicle mode where you can switch from the gas pedal to the four buttons. Also I would love a first person mode, I think that would make the game so much cooler and better, just a new way of playing. And Maybe a mode like a TDM would be cool. Just some suggestions, thanks for reading love the game!',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Why is there no controller support!!!!! For a game like this it is imperative for good controls. Playing on a touch screen is alright but I would like to be able to use a controller and considering controller support has been out sense android 4.0 this wouldn\'t even limit your customer base as I doubt any 4 year old phones can even play your game above 10fps. It seems like it is deliberately being left out and it is baffling me. Please can we use our controllers it\'s such a simple api to implement!!!! Seriously I think monkeys can implement controllers in games quicker then you guys what the hell!!',
       'This game takes way to much time and effort to download. First you have to download the game, then you have to download additional files for the game. Then you have download additional files for the game AGAIN and guess what after that? Down loading more files. Once that\'s over you start the game. THEN IT STARTS DOWNLOADING SOME BECAUSE ITS THE FIRST START. Then you download a packet verifying thw game. And then you redownload the entire game. That is beyond ridiculoua and such a waste of time for this game its a fun vame buy no way near worth all the time and effory.',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.' ],

It shouldn\'t be 9 gold bars for a second chance. If I\'m going to pay 9 gold bars then at least give me more than 5 moves for it. Besides all of that, I love candy crush. Just recently downloaded soda crush as well, love it! Keep it up!',

I recomend this game to everyone, i realy love that you can play it offline and with other players! Even if the gamers at school say this ias a stupid game, i think it is fantastic!.I live that you get candy powerups everyday instead of using your gold too!',
       'I think this game tries to force people into spending money to get to the next level at times. I will not spend money on you Candy crush. I will continue to play for free and just like always eventually you will "let me win" my current level. And when I run out of lives I will play words with Friends and solitaire;)',

That does not make any sense. Someone was not paying attention when developed  game # 191. I refuse to spend money to pass this one. I haven\'t spent 1 cent on Candy Saga. Not making $$$$ on me.',

     [ 'Whatever update you made to this game just made it suck more than it use to be. Graphics very bad like watching negative image,  someone can\'t change to another easily even at the end of the week as you so stipulated , The ads keep on stalking and crashing the game Unnecessary difficult missions, for what??? And many more.  For crying out loud, this should be a fun game, something to ease stress not cause one. Not to mention if you install it to a new device and login with your fb id, you can\'t start from where you stopped with your achievements Its becoming not-fun-anymore.',

     [ 'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝',
       'If you don\'t want to give away free stuff from the chests, don\'t. But stop wasting my damn giving me these "free" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.',
       'Mostly fun but they keep adding stupid finicky "trick shot" levels where the entire level depends on hitting some dumb target off screen or landing just right on a stupid platform. Running out of ideas and all of the new beach levels are just tedious. We want to go fast not try to knock over the towers just right this time to avoid getting stuck again.',

     [ 'Sooooooo addicting ,I love this game so fun,  relaxing and has great music. I can\'t stop playing. So awesome,they should make more word searches or word crosses like these kind of games. All though  you have to pay for some parts of the game but out of all the games I have ever played this on is #1😍😂😃',
       'My favorite word game, but I rated it only 4 stars because they repeat some of the puzzle groups as you progress through the game. I have gone through the Ocean group of puzzles at least twice now. With all the words in the English language, there is no reason for this. Also, there are many words, most quite common, that are not accepted.',
       'I love this game! It\'s a real challenge and better than the normal ones because of the backgrounds and how it\'s a crossword. You could add an online player vs player thing too. I love the daily challenges. Maybe add something to win instead of coins? If you love a good daily challenge defiantly get the game!! 😊',
       'Game itself is good but to have an advert appear everytime you get to the next level is a bit much. It\'s always the same adverts and it\'s not easy to close the advert. It directs you to playstore to install the app that is being advertised.  I know you need to make money for making this app but the ads are spoiling what was once nice to play. I use it less and less each time I see an ad.',
       'The only bad thing about this game is the sheer volume of ads. I understand it\'s to push you to spend money but it\'s more likely to stop me playing. Tone them back a little and it\'ll make for a much more enjoyable experience that I would be happy to recommend to friends. Ads are a fair trade off for a free game, but not at this current frequency.',
       'Fabulous word game. The whole family is addicted. Could do with a slightly wider vocabulary in that sometimes you find a perfectly good word that is not in the grid but it\'s not allowed in the bonus bank. But that\'s just being picky. Overall, well, well worth the modest price to go ad-free. Highly recommended.' ],

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !',
       'Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'I love this game! The cars are some of my favorites. There\'s only a couple things I would like to hopefully see in this game. First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a good game but having an add after every puzzle is a bit much. Yake a bit too much time and easyy to lose interest. Maybe every 5 puzzles wo ups be better I know y\'all gotta make your money but the constant ads make me want to uninstall.',
       'Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can\'t figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy',
       'Sometimes the hard ones are so simple you can only laugh at yourself and with friends. It\'s a game time passes and you can definitely pick your brain with friends.

       'Really fun game! Just a couple of itsy bitsy things that get on my nerves. The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??',

     [ 'I think this and most of the game since choices came out are all rip offs of episode choose your story. Now I\'m not saying they are bad apps or stories I just wish some of these people knew about episode. Though I have to admit this game is pretty fun.',
       'Let\'s be honest. This game is very similar to every other choice game. You have to wait 3 hrs for another ticket and I don\'t mind that BUT the storylines are CHEESY! Like damn, I don\'t even feel  the chemistry between the characters, you all should work on that. Also, the why you all draw the Black characters is simply awful. Work on the way you color the lips and draw the face. I hate to say it, but overall, this game is basic. It\'s a work in progress, READ your reviews and actually listen to what they are saying.',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'In the past I loved my shelf, now I kinda like it. Untold Darkness was amazing... Then I read Untold Darkness 2, I was very unhappy about it. I had hoped it was a continuation of the first, but it restarted just like the first. One of the things that got me upset was that it changed things, like not knowing Eugene, and Eddie, also I disliked how I had to meet everyone else again.  I really think there shoud be a continuation of the first Untold Darkness though, it\'s my favorite.',
       'I kinda liked it. I finished untold darkness book 1 before giving up. I also started reading a couple others to be fair. I didn\'t really like untold darkness until later on in the book, and was eager to start the second but very disappointed in the second one. I felt like my choices didn\'t really effect the outcome.',
       'I like this game, but I\'ve tried to get ahold of customer support for free credits not being awarded and have been ignored even with picture proof. Very disappointing, will probably delete if they don\'t fix it.' ],

     [ 'Playing four windows is great, having to pick a window and only winning 1 in every 25 bonus games really sucks.  Make it more like the casino game before it was changed, single window main with four bonus screens, player claims all wins, OR, keep four main windows with higher minimum bet and have four window bonus screens but player MUST claim all wins.  I am level 48 and bought my way to platinum status. Higher level players ( larger bets) wouldn\'t mind buying coins regularly if it were more fun.',
       'This game is scarily greedy. Today I started playing with 10 million coins. Four hundred (400+) plus goes later and still no free spins. That just doesn\'t happen in the real world, so the game has been manipulated against the player and in favour of the owner. Still had 300k+ coins in credit and started getting "your balance is getting low" messages. **WASTE OF MY AND YOUR TIME**',
       'Tighter than the real ones...  These are supposed to be entertaining.  The games are some of my very favorites in real life, but these aren\'t fun.  NOTHING paid, bonuses are nearly impossible to get and weak when you do get one.  The free coins are in such small amounts you can\'t play long on them.    Loosen it up a bit and it\'s an easy 5 stars from me.',
       'After 6 years of playing, I get blocked for no reason. 6 years of saving coins and winning qnd loosing until I have enough coins to play high spend room. 6 years where any day I can gain 300 billion, or loose 100billion and call it a day.   Stay away. Heart of Vegas will only allow you to play if you spend',
       'The free coins amounts are way to small. To be a free site you would expect to start off with a large amount. Either allow punters to get the feel of a real casino and give them larger amounts or bonuses. If any site advertise a large amount of coins and you do not get that amount then that site is a scam. Also free coins is the hook to get punters in and when your coins are gone that you either have to pay or you delete. If you pay i ask what do you get when you pay ?. If you pay at a casino at least you get something but not on the internet. One site i had a large amount and soon it was all gone as it took so long to get any scatters and the payout was very small and that is a scam. Same here when the amounts to play are large but the free credits are small.',

     [ 'Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',
       'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       'Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It\'s also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3' ],

Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'Creative...I have noticed that a majority of winning designs are poor in design and get 5 Stars. I don\'t think voters are taking the time to vote for the best of two and are just punching the = sign to get through the process. Would like ability to buy table, wall art and floor plants with both diamonds and cash. More videos to earn diamonds. Fix the video for diamonds feature-it keeps sticking in the "loading" mode. A more equal purchase/design ability would be appreciated. Increase daily reward and diamonds.' ],

     [ 'Finally got the game to load, was delighted to see that the multi hour rewards were 880,000, so much more than other slot games! All of a sudden however you guys have decided to restrict those hourly gifts to 200,000! How are we supposed to play these games when most of these slots by default are asking us to bet several hundred thousand credits at a time? And yes, I do buy coin packs on rare occasions, but I shouldn\'t have to just to play this game! 😒',
       'I think its fantasic i would like to see more coin bonuses as i dont always have the money to buy. Highly recommend it! 👌 be refreshing to see replies to good rateings not just the bad ones. Seriously who cares about the bad. 😂',
       'Do not download! You should not have to wait up to 250 spins for a feature (yes I counted). Get stuffed product madness, worse than the real thing. Give me my money back',
       'Fafafa gold slots are very easy slots for Jackpots. They hourly to 3 hours  bonus. They also once a day a daily spin. Levels up really fast. Now I have tried to purposely get rid of this game. However Every time I tried I would win more.  I really put it to the test. Thank you.',
       'This game was good until today. After the new update your collection gone up to 3 hours. Thats bad and thats why i deleted the first fafafa..  everu half hour collection was good why did product madness had to ruin ot.',

At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:',

Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ],

     [ 'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.',
       'This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn\'t lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it\'s better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don\'t want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.' ],

     [ 'The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn\'t receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.',
       'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There\'s no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!' ],

The graphics are simple, but considering everything else, it\'s nothing to complain about. This is on a phone after all, not a PS4. However, nearly all weapons besides the hunting rifle, though possible to attain, require an insane amount of in game currency. So unless you like micro transactions, or have an insane amount of free time, you\'ll probably only ever have the hunting rifle. 8.5/10',

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can\'t upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄' ],

     [ 'I think this game is 5 stars because it is a exquisite game with lots of fun. It\'s VERY addicting with all the hoops and basketballs. I love the idea and concept of the game. It is nice and easy so any age group could play it. I just got it 3 days ago and so far it is fun. This is one of the games I have had in a long time that was actually really fun, and addictive. I suggest you get this game because it could be your favorite game. I hope if you do get the game you have a wonderful, fun filled time.       😄🏀🎖 Have a great time and get the game! Sorry I had to put the medal I tried to find a ribbon. Of course a medal works too.',

I tried eating a M dragon and my combo time runs out because I can\'t bite him for no reason even when boosting kindly fix that co\'z even with the pet its still happening but all in all great game except for those minor things.',

I have to know what happened to everyone if some of the other couples got married, had kids. Is some characters just single forever. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS SERIES JUSTICE. I FEEL SO HEARTBROKEN.',
       'Such a shame that the makers of this game are greedy. This is an awesome game with some great stories but unfortunately you need diamonds to make alot of decisions and you don\'t get given many as they want you to buy them.  So there\'s no way you can play the game properly. The diamonds are so over priced. If they were cheaper I might be inclined to buy them. So with regret I\'m going to have to delete this game. Greedy people thanks for ruining what could have been a fun game.',

But I can proudly say that Choices is a games that had lasted the longest in my phone. It has been nearly ten month of my being connected with Choices, and I can still say that it would last for a much longer time. Keep going Choices team.',
       'This game is Fantastic only problem is that the Diamonds and keys are too expensive. I LOVE the stories specially The highschool Story but still with the same problem of overpricing the ingame currency. I purchased some diamonds just to support your spectacular game but please try to make the game a bit more affordable so it feels more rewarding at the end knowing that you didn\'t spend a fortune on one story when there\'re countless beautiful stories. Thanks for creating this game that lets me step out of the boundaries of Reality.',

     [ 'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there\'s nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.',
       'A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'I really like this game. But here is why I gave it 2 stars.  I completed all of the challenges but still don\'t have have enough score to finish ranking up.  The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don\'t think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes...',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.' ],

     [ 'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',

Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game' ],

       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',

Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',

I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',

Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',

     [ 'This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn\'t at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you\'re playing as. Perfect game. 😁👍  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There\'s an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can\'t do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.',
       'I think it\'s incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.',
       'Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company\'s stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.',
       'I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you\'re done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.',
       'First of all, congratulations on the full release! I\'ve been playing this game for a few months now and I\'m absolutely hooked. Whenever I\'m bored or don\'t want to use my phone\'s data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading',
       'It\'s simple in design and gameplay but not boring. Much better than other life simulator games.  I\'ve been playing this since while it was in beta and enjoyed it more with each improvement and update. I\'m looking forward to what else they add.  My only problem with it is job selection is boring and there is no way to save the current life you\'re in in case you want to come back to it at a later time.' ],

When I found a match and the game is downloading the dog data,  whenever it\'s halfway from finishing it always says "you have been out of the room". I haven\'t played the online battle yet but I absolutely would love to. I can\'t give this app full rating unless they can fix it and I hope they would.  Thanks and good day sirs/madame.',
       'I think I should make this game my favourite game and I could make the best high score of 2000. And thank you so so so so much.But I saw one mistake you were making that was if a player just tap a white tile you would make it out . So don\'t make the player out. Give it at least 5 chances. So that he can make his or her best high score. Please try to make it more interesting . And also when we reach higher you make it faster and faster. Otherwise this game is the best of all games.',
       'I like this game. But the problem is that whenever I lose, ads start to show up and that\'s not good. Also, whenever I start the game I don\'t have any diamonds left, when I  get notifications saying "your lives are refilled". But they aren\'t. So I think you should make some changes in the game. Need Improvement!',
       'Why do you insist on showing gardenscape ads its gotten that bad i actually hate the game now cos you keep pushing it. Thats just put me off the whole game completely and I havent even played it yet! Sucks big time',
       'This is fun when you need a Break/ or when you are bored. It is really fun and it might have a lot of ads to you but to me it is way worth it tho me. You need to get this game now. It is like nip other there is no better than this. It\'d is good for all ages.you have to get this game.it is the best there is. I play it all the time. From 1 to 100 I pick 99.9 all the time. You will not get bird of it. I stay up at night just to play this. That is because it is so fun.you can play it on any device to any device. Is you have a tablet or computer or phone or maybe even a TV if you have a quote if you could get that since the best and if you can\'t get it you should get it it\'s free I mean free this good of a game that\'s free which is amazing.that is way you should get this app.get it now why you she\'ll can. "And bye the way I did not make this game and I do not know people that made it but I wish i did!',

     [ 'I think this is an exceptionally well made game. This truly is a great golf game. Here\'s where it falls flat... I feel as if you must spend money in order to receive all the benefits that the game had to offer.  If you have 8Ball pool, then this will make sense to you. You can still curve your shot, even if you don\'t pay for anything in the game. In this game, however, you cannot adjust the curve at all when you use the basic ball. I feel as if it is closer to "Pay to Win" than other games of similar nature.',
       'This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it\'s pretty awesome!',
       'This game is really starting to piss me off.  Main issue I\'m having is the stupid game freezing and telling me it\'s trying to reconnect in the middle of a game.  I\'ll make a shot then it will continue to count me down and tell me I\'m out of time.  Freezes until my times up. I\'ve lost close to 200k in coins lately and it\'s really starting to piss me off. Also, never consistent. I\'ll make a near identical shot as my opponent and ball travels completely different. Really starting to piss me off. Been playing this game for a LONG time and I\'m about ready to delete it!',
       'It\'s cool but everyone seems to be fairly good so all matches come down to a shoot out. Meh. And in the shootouts your opponent can see ur shot if u go first. Meh. All kinds of perks for FB. I don\'t have FB. Meh. Have to spend $$ to get decent clubs and balls or play this 24/7 and I won\'t do either lol. Nice try tho playdemic. Cheers.',
       'I think most of the time i am actually playing against a computer and and not a real person . And the computer is programmed to make me lose so that i am forced  spend money on the game. The whole idea of gaming online is to have a friendly yet fair platfotn for people to enjoy and unwind.  So you based on the above very brief of the begining of the end fir companies such as yourselves... i would recommend the following simple advise free of charge.....  Safeguarding  the companies reputation is everything.  The future of gaming ,NOT INCLUDING casino/gambling type apps, will be based on trust and have a more family type target market, and thus should have different business models.',
       'Need to have a better way of placing you with an opponent\'s.  All too often do I get placed with some one with clubs a lot higher level than mine, and a lot more trophies. Starting to get old. UPDATE. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY YOU ARE MATCHRD WITH OPPONENT! I CAN NEVER WIN!' ],

     [ 'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',
       'Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it\'s a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid' ],

Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it',
       'It\'s honestly a pretty good game, it\'s fun, even though there\'s no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it\'s really bad, and it\'s insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.',

     [ 'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       'Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!',
       'I was over the moon when they put Mysteries of the past on. I hope they can do the same with The conspiracy as well. All 4 games are a must have. You\'ll never find another game like these. I love playing them because they\'re brilliant & addictive, I hope they continue to make more.',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant' ],

     [ 'The best racing game ever, I\'ve played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I\'m going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.' ],

     [ 'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 32 and I have 1.092 aa gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ],

     [ 'Fun, graphics are nice. Free money goes quickly and some of the games bonuses and free spins some have decent ones but infrequent.. They want you to spend real money like most online slots but if you don\'t play for a couple days and just collect the daily free coins you can play for a little while every few days. Unfortunately there isn\'t a lot of opportunity to get free coins. The wins don\'t out weigh the losses but that is usually like it is in real casinos so  at least you don\'t lose real money :) If your patient and don\'t continue to buy the "sale" packages but rather build up the free daily spins.  I just play other slot games  until the free coins build up a little on this one so I can play for awhile. I do like the game though, lots of game choices .',
       'Agree with other reviews...all they want is you to BUY BUY BUY!! I won $14 BILLION on a jackpot...that\'s HUGE! And yet, no matter what I played, tried small and large bets, I LOST EVERYTHING in a matter of hours!!! That\'s how ridiculous it is! Also contacted support about a glitch and they NEVER fixed it...it just rips you off on free games. Great games...just a total waste of time.',
       'I was playing a tournament u have going for Valentine\'s day. I get to a game where I have 65 million and I won over the 20 million that was a quest. I lost over 100 million trying to get a free game quest. If I want this kind of feeling I can go to a real casino and drop real money there and get the same result.',
       'What a waste of time, had free spins twice but i  all the time never once did I get 6 HEARTS. HOW MEAN CAN YOU BE.If you buy coi s good luck all they want you to do is BUY BUY BUY. Once again why did I bother.  THIS IS THE WORST SITE EVER',

     [ 'It is amazing.really keeps you hooked on.. However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.',
       'You can\'t do anything to get out of not having food but  buy it with you real money.  Not exchange options or games or spins or videos even you just can\'t do anything. This not fun. You can\'t collect the food even if you grow it. Since I did have enough gems wood or food to build the warehouse I\'m screwed with no options  but to quit the game. Sucks it could have been good. I\'m done. It\'s sad that with all the bad reviews you don\'t choose to change any of those features to improve the quality and keep more users to continue play.',
       'I like the game, it helps pass time. My only complaint is you make it super hard to do anything without having tonso3ns real money. Which is ridiculous. I get that you need to make money off of this, but don\'t be so ridiculous about it.',
       'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective. I will be deleting now at level 6',
       'Such a great and fun game but you can\'t do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.',
       'I really enjoy thie game especially the archipelago tasks. The quests on my island are pointless and so hard to do though. It took ke about a week to save up 1000 coins to give to the mumumba guy.  This is really a long time to earn money. Its a little better now with the adverts as you can skip times and earn coins watching videos.' ],

     [ 'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I\'d like. You can\'t at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I\'d like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn\'t taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it\'s worth the $1.99 purchase I made.',
       'This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don\'t really care either way I\'ll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I\'d debating on installing it just get it. You\'ll have fun, trust me.',
       'Love the game, but there\'s something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!',
       'This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don\'t think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it\'s free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.',
       'Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.' ],

     [ 'I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I\'m already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I\'m already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..',
       'Very addicting! HATE the new update! I have to get the feel of each game all over again in order to win. For the amount people spend to play, the 3 HOURS you wait to collect your coins',
       'Why do you people have to control everything. My last 7 spins on your Wheel of Fun I got 36 thousand coins 7 times in a row that is not possible unless you control the spins you should do right by your players. Your rating has gone down from 4 in a half to 3 if you continue to do wrong by all your players your ratings will continue to go down and other who do not about how good you games could be. I hope you don\'t think your players are stupid you will start to lose these people. Please do right by your players.',
       'It\'s a lot of fun. I live in Las Vegas, lol, but this is the only slot game I have on my cell phone. My only other is a Texas Holden game that\'s also fun. Definitely recommend this game. Can become addictive if you love playing slots. The first 100 spins were free! 😄👍',
       'I\'m on level 373 and it only gives you 8 status points. It could give more points when going to the next level. Also seems like after purchasing coins you lose them pretty fast. But enjoy all of the different games!',
       'Simply amazing. Would be better if winning odds improve. This casino has  amazing graphics, winning is one of the lowest.   Kudos to the removal of the 5 spin auto and the addition of 50, it was awesome. Also thank you for keeping advertising low, other casino apps flood tbe screen with ads.' ],

     [ 'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'WTH HAS HAPPENED?? Been playing for 3+ years and have NOT EVER seen the game "rolling" system so broken. I have not rolled anything worth a $$@ in almost 3 MONTHS. Don\'t give me the it\'s random thing. I have never had anything like this until after an update a couple months back. You have obviously changed the system and it is apparently to screw the long timers in favor of generating more $$ but it\'s only making long timers like me BORED and frustrated!! I\'m not spending any more money until it\'s fixed. Tired of wasting cash!',
       'I\'ve been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don\'t lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless. Plus it\'s just an incredibly addictive game that you can do well with even if you don\'t spend any money.',

Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'I can\'t do normal Sudoku as it\'s too hard. I really like this though, where I can change numbers easily & get hints. I like the highlighted errors. In time I might switch off this function & not use the hints, but it is helping me at the moment to get better... The game still requires a lot of thought. I\'ve been a bit hooked...',

Still haven\'t been able to finish an expert one in under 30 mins although I will keep on trying.  I understand the need for ads but putting them between each game is ridiculous!',
       'It\'s great love the daily challenges. Placing the numbers isn\'t intuitive for me, I like to select the number I want to work on then place it down so I often overwrite my number when I accidently attempt this. Even still its honestly the best sudoku app that I\'ve used',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'It\'s sudoku, what can I say I like sudoku, the controls could be better but they\'re not bad. But I\'m probably about to uninstall it because it keeps crashing on me, and every time it happens my best time for whatever difficulty I was working on is set to zero. I also don\'t like that it keeps asking you to rate after you already have.' ],

     [ 'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'I love this game! Been just playing on my wife\'s account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won\'t even register me moving. I\'ve tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what\'s going on?',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'The game still doesn\'t work. After the absolute failure at New York, I thought Niantic had learned, but now no one is playing this large download file (I cringe at calling it a game, their is no game-play!) and still the servers don\'t work! I walk outside on a clear day, "location not found". Niantic not as bad as EA or Bungie, but keep not trying, you\'ll get there.' ],

     [ 'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀',
       'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account',
       'What happened to the game I used to enjoy? Now everything is turning into a spam fest. Strategy has been consistently removed from the game with each update. BH still has a bunch of AI issues. For the first time ever (as a max 11 and misc other accounts) I can honestly say uninstalling has crossed my mind.',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!' ],

     [ 'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!!

     [ 'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game, I totally love it. I don\'t mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤',

I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.',
       'I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don\'t change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don\'t get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn\'t have done that then I would be impressed by the game.' ],

     [ 'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you do😕.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happy😊.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It\'s perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven\'t had any problems with it. I can\'t wait for updates later on to come.' ],

     [ 'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'Love this game, its an addictive time killer. But I would like to have replays and not sure if it\'s only my device because I haven\'t seen other reviews about it but it doesn\'t have an accurate count of flips, my friend counted 11 and it said 3.5 I do many more (yes at one time, before landing) and it still says 3, 3.5, 4',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.' ],

     [ 'Good but £4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',

       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren\'t) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.' ],

     [ 'Only given a 1 star so the devs hurry up and get the game working again or else it would be a 5 star. This is the best game on play store currently and square Enix have done a brilliant job. No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!',
       'Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can\'t load the game after update clear data and dl again',
       'Support is incredibly slow, they will happily take your money and not let you have access to the items you payed for. Will update this review if they ever actually resolve my issue. It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved',
       'I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.',
       'Characters repeat the same thing over and over and it gets really irritating. And now the game doesn\'t even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it\'s not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game.',

     [ 'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'Brilliant game play with nice updates. However, certain things can be improved. For example, the gem powered power up is not clear. I am not sure whether the power up works only for one time use or for entire one run. Kindly, help to enlight users on this part.' ],

Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that\'s how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Very cool game with good graphics but beware for this game is based around paying to play. The purchases aren\'t cheap either. If you\'re not careful you could find yourself spending hundreds yet still not getting what you need to beat the bosses. So if you\'re into forking up your hard earned cash by all means enjoy.',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts.

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.' ],

     [ 'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential',
       'Game does not give enough rewards to play on a daily basis.  It\'s too expensive to play for what you get.  Mostly I didn\'t like it because the,  "earn diamonds," section was bogus!!! I made qualifying purchases to earn diamonds and got nothing. I was pretty disgusted with it after that. I submitted requests,  complaints, went through all the hoops to redeem my rewards and never got them. I would not have spent the money had I known i would Gerry nothing for it.  Do not trust this app to follow through with promised rewards!!!.',
       'Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don\'t mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉',
       'Im simply addicted to the game and i usually play like 5 times a day and i would\'ve happily gave it a 5 stars if i could vote. I ALWAYS get the error message "there was a problem communicating with the network". I contacted the support team several times but its useless so until i can vote normally i wont be satisfied' ],

     [ 'I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it\'s said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they\'re not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.',
       'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God\'s sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn\'t worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.',
       'Ok It said Hey wanna play? Update your game..... Then when I come to update it it said it\'s updated AND IT IS..Pg2d u r bassically restricting me from playing the multiplayer battles. re u serious rn? Icant play cause i have to update the game when i already did.... Bassically waist of my money to buy new weopons when i cant use them.',
       'It\'s a great game.... until you reach level 27, then there is a REDICULOUS difficulty curve. I was steadily climbing the tornament leaderboard, I was good, then I kept getting destroyed after hitting 27 with OP items and no gems to get the new weapons, because I had spent them leveling up my weapons and was out. What are you thinking? Lag, not double jumping, not firing when I need to, occasionally. How rediculous.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!' ],

     [ 'This game is great. It helps out with working in my focus and concentration issues I have do to TBI. I have to ask though, whats the point of collecting coins if I can only use them to pay fot hints. Also, maybe add a feature where you can use coins to change the background like on some card games. Or maybe just add a free feature to be avle to change backgrounds to a users own pictures in the gallery. Maybe add a few bonus rounds here and there where you have to find words in a time limit. That would be an exciting way to use your brain more. Just some thoughts. This game has some great potential!!! Keep up the good work!!!',
       'This is a fun mix of simpler games with more challenging ones on each level. Extra points for the extra words makes it more interesting because they often include less common words and words of foreign origin. There are no clues as to what those words might be, so it\'s challenging. But there\'s also no penalty if a word isn\'t accepted.',
       'I like the game but there are too many ads. One will pop up in the middle of making a move and then pop up constantly every 5 seconds. Then it stops for a round or two and starts again with non stop pop-ups. It\'s distracting. Uninstalled.',
       'This game is a scam. It gets you going then it blocks on a game asking you to create a word and not accepting any possible combinations. You have to pay for a hint and then accepts a word you already tried before paying for the hint. This game is not really free. Scam stay away!',
       'This is a wonderful way to end my day. I am addicted. When I taught school, I would give my students a word. They were to find all the words they could out of the letters in the word. They loved to compete with others (kept them from exchanging words). Now I know why I had them do that. I love it, too!',
       'I would have given the app A five star review had it not been for the greed of the developer it\'s fun and challenging BUT to have an ad after every lvl and not being able to turn off ads permanently even with a purchase? Sorry it\'s an uninstall for me there are tons of word games with less greed' ],

But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',
       'Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'The game is awesome and there is always something to do  so you\'re never stuck waiting around for powerups or new lives. Unlike other games it doesn\'t require microtransactions to get stronger, but they do help you quicker if you\'re interested in paying. I\'m addicted and play every day.',

"Give your guildmates 10 Fortune Tickets!" for $19.99 should give ALL guildmates 10 tickets EACH. Instead it gives 10 tickets TOTAL for the guild to fight over!! Since MOST of the guild is left out, how can I give them a Fortune ticket as stated?? There is a comparable  $4.99 offer that gives 50 Fortune chest, 2000 gems, and resources.

Update few days later...   Suddenly the game keeps crashing randomly...   Tried it for days....   Can hardly survive a single level now...    Very sad....   The game itself is still excellent....   Maybe a later update brings a fix..................',
       'Fun game, my daughter enjoys playing. ..easy, yet challenging at the same time.  One irritating issue...every time there\'s an update, or just opening the app, turns on the game\'s notifications..and have to turn it off constantly. ..otherwise it would be a rare 5 star rating from me.',
       'Like with all other games this game is rigged, once you get to a certain level you are set up to fail unless you buy coins. I don\'t play games so I can go broke on coins, I don\'t like this.',
       'The game isn\'t letting go of the balls. When I let it go, it switches to the other available ball. I may spend 10 minutes trying to shoot a ball. Very annoying & irritating, but I like everything else!',
       'Just bought 3 of the $7.99 deals and AGAIN was charged $9.99 ea and no one will contact me back.  Gets old!',
       'I like playing the game, on level 46, but I am getting bored with it. it stops during the game and I loose the live and it wasn\'t even my fault. it loads very slowly.' ],

     [ 'Well I like the game. It\'s fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don\'t open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.',
       'NejiOmeGa here!🙏 I have got to say this game is a "quick paste first place!" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!🙇 I\'ve loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I\'m a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who\'s Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherz😂😂',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don\'t disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖' ],

     [ 'I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn\'t be a issue if it didn\'t take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.',
       '**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.',
       'Alright, so I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like this one is deserved. The games concept is great, as with most post-apocalyptic zombie games, surviving and building a base is the main goal. Great. However, it is a micro-transaction based game, meaning you have to pay for packages if you actually want to enjoy it to the fullest. Am I saying you can t enjoy it otherwise? No, I do and I don\'t pay for the packages, however, my house constantly gets destroyed, I\'m killed by other players who do pay, and my game progression is massively slow. So, I don\'t really recommend this game, if you actually want to "play" the game.',
       'Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you.',
       'I\'ve been playing this Game for Almost 3 months. Very Addictive tho. New update is Awesome. Im Level 90 now but i don\'t have a Gas Tank yet Because I have a Problem about Bunker Alfa Power Error. It says Device need more power. I hope i Can do Bunker even my Device is Weak. Thats why i rate it 4/5 if This issue fix Im gonna Love it 😊 5/5.',
       'This game is highly addictive. The challenges are hard but not impossible. You need patience...and planning. The Chinese new year\'s event made me used to the shortened energy usage, now that it\'s back to normal, just doesn\'t seem to be enough. But maybe that\'s where the patience comes in. Great game overall, really enjoying it.' ],

     [ 'I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It\'s simple and I like it! Couldn\'t figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It\'s KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I\'m sure that\'s on your list.',
       'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!',
       'I love this game, i\'ve been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can\'t see or control what I\'m doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.' ],

     [ 'I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn\'t too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can\'t sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?',
       'The game is a lot of fun but there\'s one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it\'s kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I\'d give it 10 stars',
       'The game is good and i like it..  But after every fight you must connect to internet,, honestly this sucks.. Fighting game needs much comfort ability but every being online its really boring and it eventually slows which makes the game awful Please fix this up  Shadow Fight 2 is more portable and nice thought this will be better than two but for this update Shadow Fight 2 Is the best...',
       'This game made me rage. Insane difficulty is literally impossible.The loot is trash, upgrading armor and weapons is better. In the fighting system, when you get cornered, your basically screwed. I miss the mechanics in Shadow Fight 2 where you cant hit him when he fell on the ground. It a really good mechanic to give your opponent a chance. But thus game, there is no mercy at all. You still get hit when on the ground which sucks. C\'mon developers, you gotta fix this!',
       'Classical pay per win game. Once you advance (e.g. lv 4-5), winning against the computer in the main quest is only possible after several days of waiting for free cards and random levelling of the weapons via chests (gained via duels). Glitches in skills usage are also observed.',
       'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.' ],

     [ 'The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can\'t even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.',
       'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..',
       'Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn\'t have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you\'re reading this and you\'re questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! 😉😀☺',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.' ],

     [ 'The game in itself is in no way a Final Fantasy Game, apart from containing many of the series favorite characters. It is however a very enjoyable and addictive game, keeping you returning for just one more battle.  I haven\'t found any bugs so far, works perfect but does require a constant internet connection.',
       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. Hopefully the game will add higher chance and still have the opportunity to get those weapons since its expiring tomorrow.',
       'It\'s very nostalgic to see all the famous characters in a game together and in a game that works. This game is awesome and addicting. I haven\'t spent any money on the game and I can still get stuff done and not get blocked by something stupid to pay for like most games. Grinding is kindve a nightmare for when you unlock later characters you want to use but the writing and gameplay is solid. Love this game and I highly recommend it to any FF fan.',
       'Loved the game from when I downloaded it and played the hell out of it none stop for days pretty much. However, after doing the latest update today, the game has lost all functionality and is unable to even begin. I\'ve attempted to load it several times, and have even uninstalled it and then reinstalled it multiple times but it still won\'t work. Love the game, its one of the best games on the app store but I\'m pretty much furious now that the game just won\'t work for me any more and I\'m not the only one this has happened to.',
       'For a phone game this has been the first one to actually grab me in a really long time. It\'s a great time killer it\'s super addictive and I even find myself stopping to focus on it during some of the harder fights. Everything\'s very rewarding and while I wish that the microtransactions were a lot cheaper all in all it\'s a really good game.',
       ':( I was excited but after downloading was met with a black glitchy screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice no luck. Gonna wait a few days and try again. Not hating on the game at all, just gonna wait a bit.  EDIT: Now that it has been patched it works perfectly, I love this game. Thanks you so much.' ],

     [ 'I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don\'t mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don\'t have then you should find a different app.',
       'Great app, just too many of the same type "romance" stories over and over again. It feels like only one person is writing stories on here, when It claims to have over 55,000 different stories. Each time i try to search for a new book to read a new, the same twelve pop up over and over. Fix that please. I very much enjoy supporting community made books but it seems like it\'s just a popularity contest on here, with the same story line and plots being used far too much.',
       'I really do like this app so much! I\'ve been using it for years and I have read loads of stories! However, I need to leave a poor review because I recently changed from an Apple phone to and Android phone and I can\'t transfer my data from one phone. I have gems and so many story progresses I need to keep. Please help! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭',
       'I wrote to support but I lost all my progress and my infinite passes I paid $10 for. It won\'t load my profile and keeps trying to give me two tickets. All my stories are not read and when I try to type in my email it said it\'s associated with another account.  Was emailed by support and they said it was fixed. Still isn\'t fixed. Still haven\'t been emailed back since last time. It\'s been three days with the app messing up.',
       'Compared to similar apps like Choices, What\'s Your Story, Chapters Interactive, & Lovestruck, this lacks both genre variety (nothing but romance, no sci-fi, fantasy, superhero, mystery, or horror, unlesd it\'s secondary to romance), & you can\'t chose to play as a guy. This is too limiting.',
       'Hi :( when I open it, it doesn\'t let me in it is getting on my nerves! Don\'t get me wrong this  is my favourite app and if think it is fantastic! But it doesn\'t let me in anymore please fix! See ya and wish you a good day 🌞 ❤💜  Edit: Thanks soooo much for fixing it love youuu 😘 keep up the good work   Edit: Lol thanks' ],

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'I  am still going to keep this game but it definitely need a new update like Flip Master which is way better. On Flip Master you can upgrade your characters  So they are better and have more skill but on here they stay the same. The last time I got the game it was fun but this time the characters are stiff and you can hardly do any flips. Definitely keeping Flip Master as my favourite!  Fun game for people who: Want to mess around Need a game that doesn\'t take to much skill Need a game to to pass five minutes  Everyone who likes this game should definitely get Flip Master because overall it is so much better! Hope my advice helped for future updates',

And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and' ],

If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It\'s a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.',
       'This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren\'t for the ADS. I get it\'s a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',

     [ 'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that\'s what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.',
       'It\'s okay, but now that I think about it, it really takes up your free time and battery, to me it is eh no use but adddictive! If I had a choice to choose between a milla-seccond or a minute, I would choose a milla-seccond but technichly, you could just go offline while you are waiting. Cool game! 3 stars.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'This game is awesome, my tablet lags a lot, but besides that, this is one of the best games in the world! The creaters should add a new planet on Jupiter for 100 decillion and the first thing you start with is a gravity proection! That would be a neat idea, but this is an awesome game! :D' ],

     [ 'Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.',
       'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'Amazing!  It\'s very time consuming and very musical, interesting, and you get to play with people from around the world.   One of the reasons it\'s so good is that there are no ads. (That is if you click on something that involves an ad) Amazing 5 STARS ALL TIME' ],

     [ 'Update: the game keeps stealing coins from me. I had 227 coins, won a single prize, immediately play a game or two with the character, and the next time I looked I only had 16 coins. And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I\'d love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn\'t block the view of oncoming traffic.',

This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you\'d have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun',

       'Platika...I know you said the game was functioning normally in accordance with the rules. I however have several screen shots proving it is not. I would be happy to send them. Still dont know how the rules would dictate a straight beating a flush? Maybe you can enlighten me?',
       'Can\'t stand the constant "deals" that are forced onto you every damn time you open the app. I\'m not ever going to pay for stupid chips that are free to win. Go suck a dick!!',
       'Still a good game to play but too many, how can I say inconsistencies in the game. How does a straight beat a flush? That has happened at the minimum of 10 times to me with every one being a ALL-IN pot. In the MEGA BONUS SPIN don\'t get hopes of winning the MEGA BONUS. Expect the lower scores 100% of time & by all means don\'t spend money on a spin. Look it\'s a good free game for awhile until game determines it\'s time to pay to play. All the "FREE" games are like this so don\'t expect this one to be different.',

Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.',
       'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points' ],

It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',

I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is a challenge within itself. I normally prefer to play game games that are satisfactory. But this game is very wonderful. As it comprisses of a rolling ball that is running over  an uneven path. So basically there can be competition between the bro who travelled the most distance. It also requires a good solid attention power along with patience.. So i would say its anice game. As of gameplay the is no ending or starting in the game it directly starts and that makes it more interesting. But at the same time also boring. But i would say that if u download this game u will definitely uninstall it after almost a month. Good game and waiting for an update ✌️',

Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',

More achievements would be nice too!',
       'It\'s an enjoyable game, I\'m near the last bases to conquer and wondering what happens afterwards. Took me about a week to get there. Big minus is, despite muting al game sounds and music, the app deems it necessary to limit the master volume of my phone while playing, quite annoying when listening to my own music while playing',
       'I like the game style, the graphics, it\'s very fun and addictive, but it needs more to it. I played this game for about 4 days, and I no longer have any use at all for gold. I\'ve conquered all the territory\'s and have everything unlocked and maxed out aside from my leave. This game could be a lot better if there was more to do. Over all, it\'s fun, and has a lot of potential, but could definitely use some additions.',
       'The game is pretty good. Not terribly long but yes it\'s addictive which makes it shorter. I wish towers and catapults were automated. In later levels I\'m trying to click so frequently I can\'t focus on watching the fights.',
       'The concept is good but its just too easy. I am level 9 and took out the level 75 city in 1 try. Its not very challenging and you don\'t make a ton of money so its boring',

     [ 'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.' ],

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'You "borrowed" a lot from MCOC, but as an avid Tekken player, I think you would have been better served sticking with the PS concept. Play the character you want, play their story for prizes at the end, and so on.  Using MCOC basic controls was cool, but if there is anything to borrow from them completely would have been the controls. Different offensive taps to create different moves, etc. Overall, it is petty solid, but could have been a hit if you stuck to your own game concept.',
       'iFirst of all I would say. It took me almost 30 minutes to just start the game. It was stuck in downloading screen. Later on it crashed on me  I fired up the game again and later It froze on me during the first fight. For 3rd time I started the game and it eternity to just pass through the loading screen. The data was downloading, then initializing and then loading. Took such a long time. Plz fix this issue. I really want to enjoy this game. But not like this. Even the game play is laggy.',
       'The odd bug and very grindy. Still strangely satisfying . Some fun to be had in finding ways to cheese the AI. Good for a quick tekken fix.  Edit: lowered my vote - despite phone on vibrate and game volume turned down it blasted my speakers at full volume. Not acceptable.',
       'Fun game overall, though I wish they would\'ve added more known characters. It feels like they just peppered in a couple of favorites. I am also having an issue where after a fight my progress isn\'t saved, causing me to have less health and I have to do the same fight again. It\'s frustrating to say the least, hence thr three stars...for now.' ],

No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',

     [ 'It\'s a good cover-based shooter, with some pretty creative characters and a good pace for quick battles. The unlock system is more than fair, with the ability to save currencies for that one big purchase. I enjoy the ability to play at my own pace without sacrificing my life to the game (cough*Kabam*cough) and I\'m having a lot of fun. I\'ve noticed that PVP tends to favor Savage, when he activates Spray and Pray once, half the opposing team dies. Twice, and the round is over. Otherwise a very well done and enjoyable game.',
       'Fun game, good time killer, great graphics. Unfortunately,  like with many other games, they sucker you in with rewards at the start only for you to soon hit a paywall. It\'s  either grind and hope you get lucky or give into the many game ads promoting cash purchases. Anything involving actually online play (co-op, PvP etc) seems to freeze or have crazy lag. Good game, definitely has room for improvement.',
       'I really enjoy the action this game brings along with good looks and simple controls. Too many times development teams get caught up in the visuals or complex control schemes and forget about what gamers really love and that\'s not having a complex control panel with nice smooth transition from level to level. Thank you for making this game a joy to play every time I turn it on.',
       'Good concept. Good game. Many glitches. For a game that\'s touted for and based on pvp it makes no sense that %80 of the time the game freezes going into a pvp battle. It\'s okay though, you can close it and then immediately reopen it to a message that tells you that you died. Fix your freezing problems and I\'d give you 4 stars.',
       'Really solid graphics and game play for mobile. Doesn\'t want to work with my Bluetooth controller. As a free game they have really doubled down on the shards and multiple currencies to try to get you to spend. You really need to grind if you want to unlock anything without paying.',
       'Update: they fix the graphics issue. Great game. If you can , would be nice to see the graphics get polished, hopefully they look better in the future...  Old : Graphics terrible, needs fixing asap,gameplay looks fun. Device: Nvidia Shield Tablet' ],

     [ 'I give slotomania to thumbs up. It has awesome  graphics, and lots of different game\'s.  It also has lots of ways to get coins, and special features. I love slotomania  have had this app for many years. I recommend it to all my friends and fellow gamers. Ok I  have spent 100$ in like  24 hours to not go anywhere I\'m going to post the screen shoots. I have been on the quest and no we\'re near  winning yes I love  big wins .',
       'As far as slots games go, this one is one of the worst. Not playable for long periods of time without shelling out money from time to time in order to recoup inevitable losses. This one follows the line of giving you quests to fulfill with sometimes impossible tasks to complete unless of course you pay money to get more coins. Look, if I wanted to pay money to play slots, I\'d go to a casino.',
       'The games are the most fun of all the casinos I have found. The winning is harder than alot but then you go through periods of great wins and then humongous losses. Overall, it\'s worth playing even if you have to wait to accumulate credits for awhile. The new challenges are fun (one is impossible to complete) but still fun. If you like interactive slots... Give it a try.',
       'I\'ve spent money on this stupid game and once u spend real money the game stops hitting. It brings up so called featured ice card on different games n u can spin n spin n spin n no freaking cards at all. N I think if u spend money on this stupid game it should hit something. I only play for fun. But it sucks hurse dick.',
       'This is a awesome app. I play daily. Don\'t miss out on the fun. I just can\'t say enough good things about this app. Customer service is A-1+. Lol, I love these games. Never thought I would be into slots, but I am. Big time! You will be too!',
       'It\'s a great game to play; however if you intend on playing on a regular basis, your going to need to spend some money not large amounts but you can do the 1.99 package once or twice a week. It\'s highly addictive and you will need lots of friends as well. Good luck and spinning.' ],

     [ 'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.' ],

     [ 'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.' ],

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.',
       'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'I have purchased 3 upgrades and the game glitches out and no upgrade when I get logged back in... I am not a very happy customer.. I love this game you can either credit my bank account back,  give me back what I purchased, or better  yet great customer service would do both.. I am asking for some kind of repayment for this inconvince or I will keep my rating low, and I will never purchase anything from your company again! Grrrr' ],

Also, the developer is clearly deleting comments and paying for good reviews or something because it\'s a very mediocre game and literally EVERY comment had the word cute in it. That\'s for a reason, we\'re not all as stupid as the kids that play this shit.',

Took me 36 hours to just download a working version, then in the middle of playing, after a few days, all the stats nullified and would not change anymore.  The game is also full of money grubbing features that pop up every five seconds.  Generally annoying, I didn\'t like it at all.',

     [ 'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Some faults Overall a simple yet addictive game. Too many ads. The game ends and instantly an ad appears and your still hitting the screen so you automatically click an ad. I\'m sure advertisers don\'t want to pay for a click that was purely a mistake. Also the leader board has people on 5000 points. I can\'t get past 78 after a lot of playing so I can\'t see 5000 points is scored without a hack.' ],

     [ 'Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',
       'I urge people to stay as far away as possible from this 1! They are robbing lying cheating scumbags, using illegal and and fraudulent tactics to get money from your bank account in to theirs! Such as offering deals and then not giving you what you have paid for! Investigation underway!',
       'Love the casino games it offers and the league I\'m on.  But huuuge has made changes to the game which makes it harder to get puzzles and always trying to sell chips  lottery tickets just to play constantly and it\'s frustrating other than that I love the game.  Use to be easy to get puzzles and be fun to play it\'s becoming about money for Huuuge always selling or you have to buy something..',
       'Disappointing, Unless you purchase chips.. you can not keep up with the Club event games.  There is no real incentive to continue. IN order to even play you will need to Start with chips over 5 Billion chips.( which you don\'t get) Otherwise you will never even have a fighting chance, as you will be betting low and never gaining.... Or get high.. lose all quick. And then quit.. Or You can Pay out of your pocket.. over and over....',
       'I have played this game for many months I have purchased and yet with all the updates you all do it keeps getting worse the payouts on the slots are horrible. The group event games are picked I think to take all our chips so we will be forced to buy I believe that until you make the payouts on the slots better you are going to lose a lot of customers.',
       'Considering the game is called BILLIONAIRE CASINO, the payouts are too little to support the name.  In the first couple of weeks on starting with the game payouts are great then like all other games you are on a continuous loss to PURCHASE COINS. Happy gaming.' ],

     [ 'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'This game is fun but I don\'t know if it\'s a bug or they\'re doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there\'s no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I\'m about to uninstall this game.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'This game cheats! Don\'t get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn\'t for you. But if you don\'t care that much, like me, it\'s absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',
       'I\'ll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn\'t be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.' ],

I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'For as repetitive as it is I can\'t seem to put it down, it\'s seriously addictive. Maybe it\'s the great graphics or the fact it reminds me of one of my old favs arcade game  Spyhunter. A few small things I would fix are; needs a running diamond total during race to see how many you\'ve picked up. A better garage showing a side angle of your car so you can see the paint jobs and rims better and the most needed item is when you click on your profile pick there NEEDS to be a experience total! Just having the circle showing your experience isn\'t enough, I\'d like an actual number total. Also another mode to think about is maybe a side scrolling mode or overhead track mode like Grand Prix 2. All in all great graphics, music and replayability!',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!',
       'One of the later updates has the game stuck in full screen mode, which makes only 4 lanes visible at a time. Music and some sounds effects stop playing after the first song until I start the next race. I honestly wouldn\'t have minded the 4 lanes thing if that\'s how it\'s supposed to be. But I know it\'s not because \'andice is asking me if I really want to exit the game. Good game to waste time with, but the devs gotta fix these quirks.' ],

After playing for a little while I couldn\'t help but feel like I was waiting for a little bald guy to want to eat me if I got an answer wrong, "cans we eats it precious". Jokes and riddles. Very good game. Well done.',
       'Game is really good specially for kids . Makes them think. Only bad part of this game is the list in answers.. they are already displayed. This makes the game very easy. It would make an awesome game if user had to enter the answers.. hope the developers fix this!',
       'The concept is cool and the riddles are fun but I dislike that it gives you four options to choose from and most of the time, it makes it very obvious what the right answer is. I would love this if it let you type in your answer or give you a section similar to hangman and you can fill in the letters for your guess. That way it actually makes you think and figure out the riddles instead of picking the word you think or know fits best. I also can\'t stand how many ads pop up during a game so simple like this. If they limited the ads and changed the layout and used a different font style I think it would highly imporove the game. But that\'s just my opinion so don\'t let this review stop you from trying it for yourself. I just think a little more time and effort could\'ve gone a long way for this app.',
       'I found "500 Riddles" to be somewhat misleading.  After the first few levels the riddles started to repeat. (Either the exact same riddle or the same riddle worded differently) Also grammar and punctuation errors in the riddles started to get annoying. But overall I did enjoy the program.',
       'The game could use a few fixes. Sometimes when you touch a level it is unresponsive. The stage count is weird. When you completed all stages of a level it says 9/10. Please fix this the overall game isn\'t bad but these are very easy no brainer fixes.',
       'It\'s fun.... But way too many adds. Still love playing it....but it\'s just annoying... Ok so to add to this: im on level 19 now and a LOT of the riddles are repetitive...again, still a good game and good time waster but I\'d prefer new and harder riddles as the levels go up ...

       'So far so good, much type of game we can played. Very kind developer give a good item free. I liked it. More costum appereances will be good (dont made weird costums). The minus is city is to small for lot of player like that. Very crowd, i cant even see other player appereances. So camera angle maybe you can make lil bit wider or higher so city can looked much bigger',

Tho unfortunately you guys updated it from the last time I played it and now, When i log in using my supposed account it kept me getting right from the start in choosing character. How can i get my old character back? Thats so unfair :( I made all effort :( My username is PetLucifer. Also, does server has to do anything in relation to that?

Twice, no Recharge Gems were given or VIP level changed but twice I was charged for the purchase?! Also my 2 purchases previous to this were successful, however I\'m losing  my Recharge Gems and also magic gems. The total keeps going down when I haven\'t even purchased anything with the gems! It\'s frustrating! I have spent thousands of dollars so far on this game and still get taken advantage of! I need it sorted ASAP due to the weekend about to start! Please reply asap' ],

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ],

     [ 'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',

I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',

     [ 'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'A lot of Numberlink programs have "fake" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard "rules" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn\'t do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.',
       'I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I\'ve had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)',

I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I\'ve been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.' ],

But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch\'s, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, "Minecraft". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man\'s best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!',

The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn\'t seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there\'s a lot I haven\'t figured out yet, but it\'s been fun learning.',

Also, it would be nice if you can label the items that we picked so that it would be easier for us to pick the item that we want. I hope you can add some more items into the game.it will be more thrilling to play. Thanks' ],

     [ 'This game would be amazing if they took away the 10 different flashing and bouncing icons from the main screen that are there just to try and sell you something. Global chat is a NIGHTMARE. Nothing but kids and teenagers talking about sex and asking for nude pics of each other on Instagram. If you can block all that out, more power to you, and enjoy what would probably be a pretty fun game otherwise. I tried it for a few days and am uninstalling it for the reasons I mentioned above.',
       'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'I\'m not going to spend that type of money on this game you need prices from $0.99 and up. Do that in the game will be more enjoyable and fun for everyone. Otherwise you just going to make people go back to games that they don\'t have to spend that much on and are more fun than this.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'Nice game. I just thought that the Babe game part should be a bit more easier and less difficult coz its hard to score the chicks when your way up to level 11 and getting to the yatch. But the rest of the gameplay is fun and challenging. Overall... its a Good Fun Game. Awesome.',
       'Everyone is defending the game saying it is a strategy game. Lies, spend big or get out. No strategy in being an average player 1 day then spend thousands to be the top player the next day. Good game if you have an bottomless pocket.' ],

I really like the sense of accomplishment I get when I make a trick shot like a bank shot off the boss\'s head and no rim just straight in! It\'s like he shoots he scores! The crowd goes wild! ..fake crowd roar...',

The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',

       'Wow, this game is fantastic! How have I not downloaded this before?? The controls are easy to use and very responsive. So far I haven\'t run into any bugs so that\'s good. I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!' ],

     [ 'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ?

Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.

Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they\'re supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, Mclaren P1, Dodge Challenger, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it.

I love all the different tribes and take no issue with shelling out a few $ to check the all out. Of course playing the free tribes leaves little to be desired if u can\'t afford the extras. Best game I\'ve come across in a WHILE.',
       'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'The game is awesome. The multiplayer portion just got added, and it is very buggy. I tried it on three games already, and there are many instances where i did not get my stars during the game. I\'ve supported the game and have every tribe except the Luxidoor, and I\'m very excited with the new multiplayer gamemode. Midjiwan, pls solve it ASAP!',
       'Guys. Love the game. Play it all the time. However...  When the update was done a week or two ago it is now locking up and shutting down. Not sure what you did but its annoying to get to level 29 of 30 and not be able to finish. For a while I would back out and just restart and it was ok. Now it just locks right back up after restarting.' ],

     [ 'The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says "combo broken" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!',
       'LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT NEEDS 2 MORE THINGS TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME.  Make a motorcyle update where us players can drift motorcycles. And also make more customization options where we can add body kits exhausts spoilers coilover axle extensions and more. Thank you and please look into doing what i asked so us players can enjoy this game that has a bunch of potential. Thanks',
       'One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.',
       'Love the game! But since the update I\'m unable to purchase cars/cash. Every time I open the game it says I need to connect to the internet to make purchases even though I\'m connected and can still play multiplayer etc. Any help would be great',
       'New update sucked. The game is really good but its really laggy now, like i get lag spikes every second when i play in a track. Please fix this cuz i really want to play this game. I wont blame my phone on this one because in the last update, it ran smoothly, no lag. Plus my phone is an ASUS, a gaming phone, there shouldnt be lag in games like these. Please, please, please fix it and I\'ll put the ratings back to 5 stars☺️☺️',

       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'Unless the devs see to this problem, I will not bring ratings back to 5 stars. One of my sims suddenly vomit on the skateboard ramp after skating & now I can\'t clean the vomit up because I end up pressing on the \'skate\' action instead. The vomit puddles are ugly but I can\'t remove it. I need some help here!!!!',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.' ],

     [ 'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Gameplay isn\'t disrupted by ads unless you want some free coins once and awhile. They aren\'t throwing the loot boxes in your face either.  The coins per hour/minute seems to be while playing only. Not sure if that\'s a glitch or how it is meant to be.',
       'Overall the game is really fun. A few minor issues like the controls being a little awkward and no way to remove ads, but other that that, a solid time-waster.' ],

I don\'t get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.',

I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',

Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all...

     [ 'Well, I still liked Duel Generations better, and wish that that game would work again, but I have to admit that visually and game play wise Deul Links is pretty amazing. Especially for a free game. I haven\'t gotten very far into it yet, but so far it\'s intuitive and just really slick looking. However, there is one reason I still would prefer Generations, and that is because I loved the inclusion of ALL versions of Yu-Gi-Oh, not just the first series. I grew up with 5DS  and Zexal more than anything, and I wish that those series could be incorporated into the game somehow. I\'d love to be able to play as Kite or Astral or something.',
       'this truly an amazing game, there\'s really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad, I just don\'t see why you\'d need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it\'d be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they\'ve purchased IRL. I bet that\'d get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊',
       'My app is not opening. I love this game wish you have have out more different cards in the packs. I would like to see swords of reveling light. A bunch of rare magic and trap cards. You should not be able to use Odion\'s chain reaction duel sense in the PvP duels.',
       'Never played Yugioh this is the first time in this game and it is easily accessible with this game to get into this card game. I liked Yugioh better than the other TCG game like Pokémon,Hearthstone,Magic etc and I thought they are kind of more complicated for me because of their sourcing system like mana and energy while its all about monster cards, traps and spells etc. Very good card game and newbie friendly in general both those wanting to get into Yugioh and card gaming in general :D',
       'Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it\'s been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you\'re at with the game!',
       'Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you\'re a competitive player that doesn\'t like to get bs, don\'t play this.' ],

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',

I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',

And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph 😂 The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game',

     [ 'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'Game is good without any aproblem it do works. It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I thought the levels would be more difficult by now I\'m on 143 at the moment. I enjoy the game but I\'m getting a bit bored with the easiest of challenges and without having to use the help button . I hope the game will  get more challenging soon.   Grandson aged 5 will like playing this game.',
       'I like that you don\'t have to pay for the Assistance or no stuff on the game to help you advance like the Hammers the ball that matches any color different stuff like that you just got to watch the ads which is fine with me at least it doesn\'t cost you a fortune to play I like the color on the graphics are very bright and colorful and good for children to play no violent content to it whatsoever great game for everyone across the board' ],

     [ 'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐' ],

     [ 'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'Good game. Though it could be better. Make range on weapons and protection when you have armor on. Then you should be able to unlock new settings besides the train. Multiplayer would be cool. Another (and the last) thing you could implement is a way for you to go back and beat the bosses you defeated already to earn money. Despite all the flaws I\'ve stated, it\'s a good game and time killer.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10' ],

There are many aggressive players that assault you early on in the game and unless you pay money it becomes difficult to maintain a stable civilization. I believe it would be better if there were cheaper or easier ways to gain resources for those whom don\'t pay to win. Thank you for the amazing game though! Love you guys and I will never quit playing!',

It seems OK, but there\'s not a whole lot of variations from other games in this category. Wish the developers of these games would add a new feature or two just to make it stand out. I\'m going to keep playing but if it doesn\'t get better after a while I\'ll probably unistall.',

     [ 'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'So honestly i love most of this game. However, you can notice that when gathering loot chests, there is a normal wheel of fortune scenario, with a decipherable pattern. However, if you look closely the game changes the options on the wheel if you come close to getting one of the better options. So instead of getting a 4 star superstar in big bundles you will get the crappiest 2 star superstar and in others you will get 150 cash insteadof a superstar. Ita ridiculous because that means that how much ever money you spend on the game, they rig it so you cannot win the bigger items.',
       'reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.',
       'I like the new update.the graphics of the chamber is very nice. My suggestion is that you can improve its value by adding entrance to the players or at least play their theme song after the game. I\'m tired of listening to the same music again and again. Plz do these changes as fast as possible. Thank you.',
       'Definitely a good game. Not into always writing reviews but this game calls for it. The only thing which irritates me again and again is the opening of loot cases because no matter when I click I would never get the desired character or thing as it changes the order once I click it so that I end up getting something worthless. The order doesn\'t change otherwise. So is this just in order to avoid players to gain good characters so that we have to make in app purchases ? Have given it a good rating just because of the actual excellence of the game.',

     [ 'So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',
       'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that\'s by design so I spend money. Which I won\'t do. I just want some "bubblegum" to past the time.  Now, it\'s making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...',
       'I  love this game but why does it take 30 minutes for a life to refill and also why does everyone who plays the game not receive ten lives only some of your players this needs to be fixed it\'s not fair I\'ve been playing for years and only receive five lives at a time when others receive ten lives.I play other games and the lives refill every 7 to 15 minutes. Can you please make changes',
       'Really an exciting game. But there is a small problem. Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response. Hopefully you will fix this problem ASAP. Thanks!' ],

     [ 'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.',
       'This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it\'s so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can\'t find it 😑... the games the b💣mb. But the update I don\'t have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged' ],

I enter the details, it tells me that I\'ve already logged in, I go back to the game and it just does the same thing over and over..... Anyone know how to solve this issue? Website is no use at all',
       'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'Wth ! Game gets hanged, as soon as you use mighty scope in mighty league. Not one time, or occasionally. Everytime since last update. WHAT A MESS ! Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Love this game but keeps freezing, a lot! It\'s more frustrating since the update where it costs 30 coins for the telescope but only get 5 minutes instead of 10 now and half the time my games frozen and the time runs out FIXXX' ],

       'I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There\'s ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there\'s one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It\'s miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi',
       'Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there\'s some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That\'s pretty lame. Other than that great game',

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!',
       'Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I\'m stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!',

But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'My absolute all time favorite game! I used to have the woodblock version and would play that one ALL the time. The only thing I didn\'t like about it was that I couldn\'t get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It\'s got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don\'t feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it\'s a good way to get your mind working if you\'re someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒' ],

     [ 'I had this game a long time ago and it is one of the best games out there. It hasent changed since when I usted to have it it would be nice to get some new maps or bikes and maybe change the layout of the menu. And maybe even a multipler more where u play with other people/friends and just free ride or challenge to see who can get more points. Other then that it is a crazy fun and addictive game.',
       'I know that this is very good but you should not keep levels paid you can do like if you complete the last mission in all the required conditions. If you solve this I am damn sure that this game can become the best game on play store.  BY THE WAY Nice work ILLUSION LAB :)',
       'LMAO, how pathetic. Not even possible to control this garbage.  It is nice to see that your level of dedication matches the skateboard version of the game though, along with the PC version, and that you continue to abandon your paid software, you thieves.',
       'I liked the game a lot. The graphics are great and the tricks are to I loved every thing about. But the one thing I do not like is that ther is no free ride. I think it would be better if ther were skate parks and stuff like that to ride on.     😀💚GREAT GAME💚😀',
       'Awesome!!!! It\'s an awesome  game.......But(there\'s always a \'but\' coming from me ;-) )......You should work on the reality glitches. Like when you start, in the first levels(the docks)...You move and the bike rolls down but when you move up the next slope it doesnt....You should work on that. One more thing......You should not keep all levels payed. You should keep it like, if you beat a certain record or you finish the course faster than the time given already. Otherwise, HATS OFF TO YOU ILLUSION LABS...GREAT WORK!!!',
       'I really enjoyed this game till now... I completed all the challenges on docks and have 200 adrenaline but haven\'t unlocked next map!?! I went online and researched it and you apparently need 210 adrenaline but there is no way to get it so you have to burly full game!!! This is a money scam' ],

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',
       'Fun game but janky/sketchy ads. The ads will unmute your device and turn up the volume before they play, over and over again, so you can\'t​ play the game anywhere quiet. The "x" button on the ads is not in the right position, so tapping it doesn\'t close the ad and you have to hunt for the hidden close button. Bunch of the ads never load and just show a empty gray screen.',

     [ 'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',

Fix then 5 stars',

     [ 'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.',
       'Quite addictive and challenging isnt just about solving the puzzle though because requires a certain amount of precision in drawing various shapes that work within the games physics. One mistake and time to restart. Addictive nonetheless and provides some good challenges and perhaps outside the box thinking. Perhaps the drawing tools could be more precise e.g different brush thicknesses? would help but bloody bloody bloody good anyway..' ],
    recentChanges: 
     [ '- Bug fixes',
       '- Added 2 new shapes and 1 new goal to the level editor',
       '- Increased the number of levels per tab on the community screen to 100',

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',

     [ 'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I\'m from Michigan,we\'re both married ,but there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜' ],

     [ 'Great game, no build waiting times, lots of strategy, a mix of tower defense and rts. Really is a game with a lot of effort put into it from non greedy devs. Well created hiker games. One small point that a future update could sort out is making a feature to create the same bandits again. Rather than manually going in and picking them again. And if you have spares, to automatically put them in place. Also duplicates seem to have no purpose as of yet....',
       'At first I got a clash of clan type vibe due to some mechanic like throphies and graphics. But the game is widely different and in a fresh new way. It\'s basically tower defense where you play both the defender and attacker roles which is done very well.',
       'Love mini games, also building tokens to obtain chests... please keep updates coming! And would love to zoom in more but I dig the overall quality of the game... when can I use my convoy to attack towns and castles?!?! Later on in the game?? Thanks!! And I would buy more gems if the price was reduced... fyi',
       'It was a really great game at first. It\'s a good strategy game like clash of clans where you try to beat 100% of an enemy\'s troops and vice versa where you gotta try to build up your troops (cavalry) so they don\'t take your trophies.  However, it is really difficult to get gold and the game really tempts you to buy game packs or in game currency. Most players in the game are really leveled up too, so it\'s really difficult to move up...  It\'s an addicting game, but I stopped playing because I know I was going to end up blowing my money on it eventually. You will too as soon as you get hooked on it, so just beware.',
       'Seriously... The recent update... Seriously, a major disaster! MAJOR BATTERY CONSUMPTION! My battery drained like craaaaaazy while playing on the new updated version! Please oh please fix it.. I\'ll be giving you a full 5 ✨ for fixing this issue. Playing on Huawei P10 Plus by the way..',
       'Why must you force to link my Google account or share my Device ID just to try out the game to see if I like it? Not acceptable!!! You should explain or ask for Device ID before the download! Waste of time! The more I think of this, the more it disgusts me. Please be aware AND be sure, if you are playing anything for free, it\'s because YOU are the product! Don\'t give anyone your data, your contacts or anything else that\'s personal to strangers!' ],

       'One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it\'s been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.',
       'I can\'t see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you\'re spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc\'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there\'s better players @ the position that you\'ll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!',
       'I think i\'m dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can\'t, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru',
       'EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it\'ll be a gamechanger really...it\'ll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It\'s the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦',
       'Low framerate. How come i enjoy a game that has low framerate? I\'ve contacted the customer support by email but i\'m not sure they listen to my complain. Lots of players who have the same framerate issue as me. This game doesn\'t even look different based on its performance.' ],
