        "Dear Devs - pls read thx Very good game. The graphics are awesome. ONE thing. You need to fix and balanced some of the skills. Input from me is to adjust KENSOU ULT on tournament. That even fighters that have 3500 power pts different cannot defeat him. Pls reduce and adjust accordingly to only one time healing. Thank you keep impoving. Server rugal.",
        "Great game indeed Overall it is a great game. The combos are easy to catch, nice sound effects, great rewards. The only thing I want to ask, I used facebook login and everytime I login, I must re-enter my email and password. Is it some kind of bug? Or is it just the way it supposed to be? If it is a bug, please fix it :)",
        "Downgrade Hero hey man its really nice game.. i love KoF since elementary school.. and ofcourse rlly exciting to play this game. but one thing, to improve your game more better.. can you just put downgrade system than only degenerade equipment? its useless i think.. if you use downgrade hero, its automatically all stuffs on that hero will be get back since the more level you get the more harder you get gold and exp man.. thanks!",
        "Account error login fixed, but... Thanks dev for already fixed the account login error problem on my account, but what  a surprise? My diamonds is all gone T-T please return it back devs, i buy it with my real money... i already send to ur email about my recharge buying evidence and no reply... it's like ur do cheating us players if like this dev... So to other players better more carefully if u want to buy this game IAP... They may lost it without any compensation to us players -_-",
        "Good luck trying to log in. They are greedy for your money but too cheap to maintain their servers. Not to mention any bugs that would cheat you out any resources will never be fixed. Update: Now they are committing fraudulent acts and screwing over the gamers in their servers. Do not play this scam.",
        "Kensou Over Power Kensou he is not a tank fighter or boss. When he is in the 'front lane' and 'alone', he will healing double on himself. Usually his ULT is for himself and 1 ally that have lowest health. But for some reason he heal only for himself and get double healing. So when in the arena his health is about 20% left, he use ULT and get health almost 100%. Another problem is that he can ULT many times. When he attack a fighter once, then 2 opponent fighters attack him, the next turn he can already use ULT."

        "A great game with unique map designs and user friendly controls, free to play if you have patience and play strategically, pay to win if you want to advance faster. It is especially a good game for busy people like me who can only spend 10-15 minutes per day but need to stay in the game for a large number of days to be competitive. Don't try to use items and gems on every maps, it is fun and challenging to clear them without shortcuts. *Tip for developers*: Instead of giving purchase options for Sethos and Phoenix they could go with Yan and Narlax, gives chance for new players to compete also developers can milk in additional purchases.",
        "Great TD game with decent difficulty and NPCs progression while still maintining a pattern making you work to figure out various strategies.  Ads have never been an issue I honestly cant remember where they are.  I think they may only be for like \"double your rewards for battle\" kind of thing.  90% (A) or better in my oppinion.  Mainly cause I want to see more progression.  Note I am only a few levels in so I dont know if theres a pay to get by an immpassable place yet.",

I am at level 90+ and found the first 3 worlds great fun and balanced but now you have effectively destroyed the enjoyment factor by making the enemies SO strong that you cannot possibly beat them unless you have max level heroes...and the best max level heroes require so much to level up that without paying an absurd amount of real money you may aswell give up.you have broken what could have been the best game on android with selfish Pay 2 win tactics . Uninstalling after months of enjoyment and gameplay.  You need to fix this and make it challenging but not impossible",

It allows user to partially immerse into the game   and it's super fun and at certain level it requires a very good teamwork with the rest of team members in order to be on the top. Heads up: Avoid teaming with a selfish stupid player..bring no good so far."

        "I just updated the game which fixes some minor bugs. But, Game stuck at 11% before updating & also after updating & it's become HABIT for me to see the Gameloft's March of empires: war of lord games SERVER PROBLEM. I am a Android mobile user, so, there must be a option of graphic quality change just to make sure that game runs smoothly, because I spend many months to grow & if big guys using PC version attacks, then I can't do anything because my game just freezes, lags & don't respond for some time. But the game is over for me as I loss so much. So, Gameloft launch a LITE VERSION FOR ANDROID USERS or there are huge chances of players who will leavethis game & already many left this game, as you can see the are many dead castles in each realm.",
        "Please upgrade to more realistic graphics and gameplay like Age of empires 3. Think more innovative like Fort camps to protect capitals and much more is needed in regard to spies, make it more difficult to spy and gather info. Also the defenses should be given more importance cause some guys from all realms have huge armies and it's easy for them to break into castles, I prefer more options when it comes to defenses. You guys are doing great but more options the better."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

I will spend real money on the game but not until this issue is resolved. Thanks p.s.- same issue again! Updated latest version and did not get the rewards for updating! Please resolve!",

Had the update message so I updated it and it is not letting me collect from the update message sort it out pleade",
        "I really started to enjoy playing this until problems hit upon trying to contact the customer service it was made so difficult that I just gave up, it's a good game but in all honesty with the amount of problems that are actually in this game I wouldn't even bother not until they've sorted out their lives and got something done about the problems that they're actually having. The customerservice page also seems to be a Facebook page, where upon successful contact of the customer service they will ask you for your device model your gamer ID they will ask you way too much information that they do not need as this is all computer based and should be quite self evident as to what server and person is contacting them. I had no choice but to contact Google regarding this as it doesn't seem like a normal practice given the amount of games that I have played from the Google Play Store of this type.",

        "I absolutely LOVE this game!! The stories of each character are amazing! I just wish they had more suitors. And I wish they made more games exactly like this but with a completely new story line and characters. Like, I love the voice animations and how long the chapters are and how long the story line of each person is. I also love how your character talks like a modern day girl when she's at the sengoku era. You don't have to pay to see more about each person either. It's amazing. I Love this app. Please make more!!!! ❤️❤️❤️",
        "So, this is my third update. That's how much I love this game 😂. Thank you for giving us castle and closet space via game events. Very helpful. I don't have anymore lag issues. And I appreciate the diversity in storylines. No route is the same, unlike other Otome games. Also, the relationship development is fantastic - not too slow or fast. The main character actually talks like a real person and less like a \"character\". Art is beautiful, too. I just feel bad that I can't say much about the music or voice acting, as I usually have my phone on vibrate.",
        "Idk what to say, but one thing for sure I really loveee this game!!!! Is so awesome, the chara omg so magnificent. I don't mind spending much money on this game hahaha it's so freaking beautiful!!! And I really love the MC she's so strong and cute, it's just like I want to have a route for MC too. But rn I'm waiting for KENSHIN UESUGI route, I hope it will come out soon. Damn, Cybird always make such a beautiful otome game. Thank you for making this game, it just made my life💗💗💗💗",
        "I couldn't resist to do a newer version of the review, so here it is. I've been playing this game for nearly three months now, and that's saying something. First of all, the story is really engaging. The characters are really sweet, and I love how we don't need to spend money to enjoy it, unlike other otome games. Shout-out to the people who made Ieyasu's route a dream come true.",
        "There are only a few routes out currently but they are wonderful all the same. The main character is funny and reacts realistically to situations! Not to mention the voice acting is impeccable like wow I don't speak a word of Japanese but everytime Nobunaga speaks I'm just nodding along. Also this game has an adorable animated series and it is the best",
        "The most romantic and sweetest experience of falling in love game..  I feel like I'm truly falling in love with Masamune date.. Love his playful side, his sweetness,  fierce yet gentle  sometimes.. The only reason I CANNOT RATE 5 STAR is I cant read back the route chosen even though I have spent actual money..  Its like I'm purchasing the story,  but the fact is,  I'm not.. This is frustrating..  Atleast after having spending so much money,  we can keep the story to be read again afterwards..  Please reconsider this..  Thank you"

Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",

        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

        "It's pay to win for sure. However, if you play daily and stick to monthly and quarterly cards you'll rack up gems and heroes quickly. It took me over a year to get my VIP high enough to get the monthly meta heroes. I get an hour or two a day out of it and even when I didn't have the monthly paid heroes I had a fun time. I don't mind spending $15/month for the amount of time the game helps me kill.",
        "I'm a paying customer, which they call \"VIP\" but you best believe you are far from important. I had an issue with a purchase in December, but support takes a week per message to reply and isn't useful at all about the issue and tells you they can't help. Should have let Google refund the money before the 48 hours instead of giving their support a chance.",
        "Don't download the game . If u want to win u must spend thousands dollars. A huge skins with control every month 2 new heroes with amazing power. Every month making new heroes and the old ones getting trash. Random game no strategy. Just click for pic. Ucool don't do anything. Don't download!!! I played more than one year and every month it's getting worst. The forgetting about players. They think only for cash. Ucool one of the worst organisation..if u don't spend a money please don't start the game .nice pictures  and that it )))",
        "This game was a very well balanced game between free play gamers and those that put money into it. Not anymore. If you want to be competitive you must put handreds of dollars each month (no joke). Very dissapointed in the way this game has become.",
        "A very good game but a pay to win. I myself paid 73$ and I am VIP 8. This game can be fun without paying but to get the most out of it atleast  buy an annual card for 30$. If you have even more to throw away try buying all the cards when they run out get a new one. (Mainly Annual and Season Card. Week card isn't a must have). Also if you are new to the game wait for a new server to start. That way you wont fall behind. I am on server 210 and have also played on server 207. I was in this game when it was brand new and purple heroes were the best. I was in 1 of the 1st servers and f2P I quit the game at lvl 50 though. All in All if you want to play this game prepare 100$",
        "The menu is very unresponsive when scrolling. Also, when killing enemies, particularly after using a special ability, the enemy simply freezes and then fades away - there's no animation for the death of the enemy and this is disappointing and detracts from the immersion. Otherwise it's a good game, but significantly more heroes would be necessary to keep me interested."

        "Addictive and engrossing game.  The bonus covers work well. The constant character tweaking and release rate makes the vs progression awards with wins is very good.  The favorites is a good way to let folks focus on building certain characters.  The transition points are still frustrating, especially when you get a run of bad luck with tokens.  Tokens might work better if they scaled instead. Biggest issue is progression awards in versus and the tough transitions in levels.",
        "I have been playing this game for a few years now and love it! But a little suggestion... Because of the time I've spent playing it and the already difficult ability to get 4 and 5 star characters, I have nearly 3 million iso-8 that I literally cannot spend. Please add a way to convert iso-8 into hero points or command points!!! I'd like to get further in the game instead of literally stockpiling iso-8. This has all been done without spending a single dollar on the game too, btw",
        "This is an awesome, addictive and hyper fun game. Brilliant idea and concept. In all the games I have played this is the first I have spent money on. VIP member. Have a couple suggestions for developer tho. Can you add abilities to swap covers with alliance members and maybe add as a bonus drop for playing, an extra free slot. Keep up the brilliant work. Truely love this game.",
        "This is my go-to game. Day and night. It's fun, simple and sometime challenging. My only complaint is that i have like a million of Iso-8 and don't know what to do with them. My thought would be that if we don't need so much Iso-8, be sweet to give some to aliance member who needs it or so on. Great game. Don't know what I'd do without it!",
        "Suitable for all age groups, Marvel Puzzle Quest is a great game for everyone. Progress with higher tier characters may be slow but yet significant. The wide variety of heroes and villians within the game allows for endless possibilities of the \"best team\". Highly addictive, I would recommend this perfect game to anyone and everyone.",
        "Love that they are always adding new characters. Would like to see some different characters like Cable, Domino, Sabretooth, and Bishop just to name a few. Just because they don't have a movie... Would also like to see some new events, new animations, and less repetitiveness. Love the collection part and finally being able to use characters when you've finally built their powers enough. Love that it can be played for free. Love that feedback is read and the game is constantly evolving.Thanks."

        "Awesome Game!  I love everything about it. From \"Zelda\" look to it to the strategies needed to succeed. At first I thought it would be boring cause it doesn't look like the latest technology but that's what's awesome about it. Totally old school baby! Big two thumbs up from me. You have to try it. Don't judge the book by its cover. Easy play, great graphics, affordable if one chooses to pay which is not required. I got an 8 star card without paying a dime. Just participate in the events and you'll be fine. Thx for the fun guys ( and girls 😆)!",
        "I don't understand why this game isn't under the strategy section, for plenty of it is involved for all players! For example, you have to strategize how much money you're going to take out of your paycheck each week to play this game and actually keep up with it. I've been playing this game ever since the highest rarity was 6 stars, but the 11 stars are absolutely amazing! I just can't wait until they announce 12 stars! Or 18 stars! Or 27 stars! I'll definitely be paying $100 - $300 for a single card then!",
        "Fun, sometimes It's a fun game,developed to encourage you to spend money. \"I'm done with this game! After $300 I still didn't get that 10 star!\" Is a common phrase I hear from my allies.. My reply is \"you spend money on this game???\" Anyway, I've been playing for years and I have plenty of 9 star cards and one 10 star. So year it's definitely a pay-to-win kind of thing. But luckily the Events can be fun, and it's a distraction at least.",
        "Been having a problem starting 26/12/2016 where i try to enter the game and it says i need a working internet connection. My internet is fine, uninstalled, reinstalled. Same issue. Please help me out!! Brilliant game, super addictive play it all day every day. You don't NEED to pay to be effective, just patient and smart. But paying could help you I guess if you have the favour of the RNG gods.",
        "This is an update to my original review in 2013. Fantasica is light, fun and intuitive. The mechanics for the tower defense are well set out. Constant events and new cards are always being added to keep things from feeling stale. There are cooldowns, like all free games nowadays, but fantasica doesn't force hours of downtime.",
        "Sent them email asking:  Why is my login count stop at 256? Do you cap it at that number?   Moba reply: \"Regarding your concern, please provide us with the following information so that we can properly assist you:  Account name: Mobage ID: Date the issue occurred: Screenshot of the issue: Device type: Device OS:  We hope to hear from you soon.\"  After I sent them those details.

Need to loosen slots. Been playing over 800 consecutive days and over level 1220. Side challenges and jackpots dont pay either. Best of all the slots I've played tbough. Would give 5 Stars if payouts were better and emails would work.",
        "Fun to play, and you can win real world comps in Vegas. I waited to review this game until I was able to redeem some rewards so I could know if it really works, and I'm happy to report that it does. We've redeemed two comped rooms and a couple other little things. Also play Pop Slots, points are shared between games, and Pop Slots has more rewards available.",
        "Great game. Need to be able to get free tokens more often and wins need to be more often. I see the bigger the bet, the less times you win, but must bet max to level up quickly. Yep, you loose your tokens way to often. Improve and I will edit my review. :-) update....deleting game. Find some other idiot who will pay to play it. Seriously, impossible to really enjoy without buying chips. Good luck!you will lose. BIG TIME",

Now if the U.S. gaming authorities would only take that big fat stick out their asses and allow real online gambling like so many other countries do.  Imagine, playing the EXACT same slots, keno, bingo, poker, etc. from the EXACT same companies that provide those machines to your favorite physical brick and mortar casino!   And then WINNING A JACKPOT or a Big Win!   I'd love it!  & so would you....",
        "The games are ok and the graphics are decent but the payouts are not. I buy average 40 to 60 dollars a week in points plus the free points and the games games just don't have a good payout rate. That's probably the worst thing. And not alot of free spin hits. They use to now like everywhere else you can go they are tight and just take take take.",
        "Love the games. It is very addicting to play. You forget time. Would like to see bonuses more often. The 1 thing I don't care for is, you can only collect gifts once in 24 hrs. They post, you try to collect they disappear with no coins..."

No help, and no fun if you enjoy the leveling up your character part. Basically if you want to watch your character bounce around and  not know what's going on then this games for you. To be fair, guess you would pick it up sooner or later ; (",

        "This auto complete thing can be good, but I don't like how it does everything for you. You don't even play the game, it plays itself and has zero explanation of what to do, just pulls you into different directions. Sorry, if I want to play a game, I ACTUALLY WANT TO PLAY IT!!!",

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

I have managed to successfully transfer all my old data to this new app before, but I would like to transfer my new & existing data to another device. I have registered & followed all of the instructions to the tee on the transfer form & it always says \"could not transfer data\" . Also there is no fill space on the form that prompts to fill in  'Support ID'. I hope this gets looked into.",

BMP's scene transition fx) and if possible, I hope the data on device can be stored in the SD card as it's taking up quite a lot of space. Thank you very much for the hard work and improving the app all the time, Voltage. ^^",

It requires unfathomable patience for how many days just to get the whole story. One chapter for 100 coins, I'm fine with it if it has only 5 chapters but aside from too many chapters it has also separated sequels and epilogues. *cries*  Please reconsider changing the amount of coins. Hopes for better system and greater stories.",
        "Loved it,even though at the beginning,i 'm a bit skeptical about it, it is kinda efficient in some way.but i do miss the standlone apps.also the login bonus is quite dissapointing,like we only get 5-10? At least give us a bit of generous amount like 10-20 coins",
        "For anyone looking for an MC who isn't a pushover, try the newer stories. Our Private Homeroom stands out as unusually well-localized, to the point it feels like someone studied the English speaking hemisphere of the Internet for modern slang. I very much appreciate the upgrade in sass and backbone, so it was pretty well done nonetheless. I've been a monthly subscriber for months with no intention to change this.",
        "Prices aren't competitive with paperback books. Why spend $4 per chapter when I can buy a 400 paged book new for $8. Also, the daily login bonus gives 5-10 coins per day; it would take months to unlock a single chapter at that rate. The only thing thia app has going for it is the free story every 2 weeks. 🙏🙏🙏 I suggest making this work more like Voltage's Lovestruck app & also letting us watch adds in exchange for coins."

Now tight as the other casino.  Update: super tight with wins.  Haven't been able to keep 1mil in a long time. Update: seriously!?  Loosen up some. I need a jackpot!!",
        "One of the better slots app out there. I have had many and most the time they are uninstalled as fast as they are installed. Still trying to figure out a couple of things like the high five blue hand and the crowns...how do you earn them?   Otherwise I love it easy to play and the rewards are really good too!!! Thanks Big Fish❣❣ Still enjoying the game",
        "I gave it a 3 because the minimum bet is still a little high and you can't play if you don't have enough. If he got his lower the minimum bats then I'll give it a 5. I am having fun playing the game though just want to put that out there",
        "It's impossible to get bored with this app. It has a wide variety of the most creative, fun games with HUGE payouts and bonuses!! And no interruptions with ads. It's addictive, in a good way. You'll never want to play any other app. This is the BEST one out there! I 💜 it!!! So will you!",
        "Well done BF this is another great slots app!! I only give you 4 🌟s because of the glitches. For example; I haven't been able to play the new Leprechaun game sine the last update and I'm not signed in through Facebook so if I uninstall the app then reinstall it I'll lose everything. Also I have great 100 Mbps WiFi but still get bumped out room, especially if I'm on a winning streak. Fix my Leprechaun game and give you 5⭐s across the board!!",
        "You don't have to make purchases to win big!, NO ADs, bonus coins often, BIG Jackpots. Awesome games and graphics. Group, friend and private play.  Contact a real Agent in usually less than 24hrs by email. They may actually set up a phone call if needed. Just give them a try...it's free, free, free."

Too much a pain in the ass when you get stuck on a floor cause you can't beat the boss with current gear but you need to advance to get better gear.",
        "Wow.. I though it an RPG game.. Well ur role is to create an account and that's it... All auto, game play (if any) is rushed..no time to savor the game.. what so ever.. U keep getting full bags.. When u try organizing, it full again in before u finish...and much more.. In my opinion.. It's not a really a game..  well just money sucker maybe.. (Just my opinion).",
        "Picked this game up because it looked kind of like Nonstop Knight, and I liked Nonstop Knight. Unfortunately, it's not LIKE Nonstop Knight, it IS Nonstop Knight. It's a lazy reskin of the same game with more micro transactions bolted on.  Don't waste your time. Nonstop Knight is more fun and it won't do everything in its power to drain your bank account.",
        "Stay away from this game all it does is rollback after you do stuff in game it's so great to get to lvl50 3 days in row to just be knocked back to lvl47 3 plus times a day.  They steal items gained, don't bother to reset attempts, just waste of time.",
        "The gms in this game care nothing for their players. There was a \"rollback\" bug that liked to remember everything you spent, but not any of the rewards or achievements you recieved. After losing over 4k gems, multiple pieces of advanced gear, a very rare talent, countless forge points, and even a rare pet, they decide to give everyone 1000 gems as a \"shut up, take this even though we know you lost so much, but we aren't doing anything else to keep our players\" as a reply pretty much.  The game it's way to buggy and full of support that just doesn't care about their players are all. I would never suggest playing this game to anyone.",
        "As promised here's my edit. The latest update seemed to resolve the issue, at least for me. Although I see in chat others are still having the issue so hopefully this will get resolved for good. Thank you for your speedy service."

        "The game is great.. Awesome graphics and ideas.. Would be nice if there are more players. There are many servers but less players.. Maybe you guys can merge the servers? So there would be more players. Also if avatar emojis features were there, it would be fun to intract with players, like sitting, crying, sleeping, like those in age of wushu.. Other than that This is an awesome game.. Better than age of wushu for me.. And also very addicting..love it.. Hoping for an update..",
        "Great graphic but u need to work on the gameplay more as well. The gameplay doesnt seem very...natural,and u gotta have an option where u can disable \"auto\" for players who dont wanna use that feature.",
        "Hey idiots who complain about auto.  Here's a tip:  Don't use it.  Great game, needs more players.  When going to a quest or npc, there should be an arrow pointing us in the right direction, which will let us enjoy flight mode more, manually.  Servers need merged.",
        "Age of wushu & Sword of Shadows *-* both are my fav rpg from Snail Game (Y) great graphic!!! Made me addicted spend long hours to playing",
        "I love the game as well as Age of Wushu and Sword of Romance, now the only problem i have is that my cellphone gets super hot, I can not touch the screen and have to let the game rest until i can play again. If you can fix this issue that would be great. But thanks for having English version of games like this.",
        "it's fun, but i think they need to improve PvP arena from auto mode only to free control mode, and hope they will make more new bosses. this game is fun and don't need too much RAM and ROM hope this game will have more active player"

    "description" : "Quyết khô máu cùng anh em!Với sự thành công rực rỡ khi ra mắt, Kỵ Sĩ Rồng tiếp tục cập nhật phiên bản 2.0 mang tiên Chiến Binh Huyền Thoại với nhiều tính năng mới hấp dẫn. Trong đó nổi bật nhất lần update này là tính năng liên đấu 3vs3, cho các Dũng Sĩ tổ đội với nhau để tranh tài liên server cùng nhiều thời trang, tọa kỵ mới.I – Giới thiệu:- Đây là tựa game mobile MMORPG duy nhất không chia phe hay thế lực, mà tập trung vào hệ thống Quân Đoàn để gắn kết cộng đồng.- Kiểm chứng bởi cộng đồng game Hàn, đây là tựa game có hệ thống tương tác giữa người chơi sâu sắc, mật thiết. Có anh em là có tất cả!- Đồ họa chuẩn Châu Âu, hình ảnh sắc nét, hiệu ứng và kỹ năng hoành tráng.- Game có hệ thống Lãnh địa tranh đoạt mang lợi ích vô song và thực tế nhất.- Chiến trường không giới hạn, Quân Đoàn chiến vinh danh Hoàng Thành Chủ.- Hệ thống Boss đa dạng: Boss dã ngoại, Boss thế giới, Boss Quân Đoàn…- Game có hệ thống Pet và thú cưỡi phong phú nhất trên mobile- Đám cưới sang trọng mang phong cách quý tộc, diễu hành quanh thành.- Tối ưu hóa trên các thiết bị có cấu hình thấp, tự động điều chỉnh chế độ tiết kiệm pin khi không có thao tác.Ngoài ra, Chiến Binh Huyền Thoại - Kỵ Sĩ Rồng 2.0 còn rất nhiều các tính năng đặc sắc khác cho các bạn thỏa sức khám phá!II- Lưu ý từ BQT:1. Game đã thiết kế dân cày cũng có vị thế độc tôn, còn VIP thì sẽ nổi bật oai hùng. Vì thế, anh em chả còn lo bị GATO, tứ hải giai huynh đệ.2. Tựa game này TUYỆT ĐỐI không dành cho người “yếu tim”, sống ích kỷ chỉ có hại không có lợi.3. Có thêm ANH EM, càng đông càng vui4. Trong game có vô số Quân Đoàn, gặp là “bem”, ngứa mắt là PK5. Khỏe chưa chắc đã “cân team” nhưng ĐÔNG lại là một lợi thế6. Treo máy cày quái là bình thường, nhưng hãy CẨN THẬN những tên “farm người”, tranh bãi train.7. PK đồ sát người khác bị chữ đỏ? Lính canh không BỎ QUA cho bạn đâu. Vào tù còn có thể bị mấy thằng bạn khốn thả chó cắn. Nghĩ mà cảm thấy, tym tao đau quá man ! Hiện nay trên thị trường có rất nhiều tựa game khác, cảm ơn bạn đã chọn Chiến Binh Huyền Thoại - Kỵ Sĩ Rồng 2.0 – Dragon Knights của SohaGame.

    "description" : "HỢP KÍCH 36 THẾ - XƯNG ĐẾ THIÊN HẠ“Một trong những sản phẩm game thẻ tướng chiến thuật chất lượng nhất đến từ Studio của Netease – một trong những công ty game lớn nhất thế giới, Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng xứng đáng là trò chơi công phá năm 2018 được game thủ kì vọng nhất.” – Sendor Grimer – BTV Gamek.vn1. PHÁT HÀNH TOÀN CẦU VỚI NHIỀU NGÔN NGỮ TẠI NHIỀU QUỐC GIAPhát triển từ một Studio thuộc Tencent, Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng đã được phát hành tại 6 quốc gia thị trường lớn trên thế giới bao gồm: Malaysia, Indonesia, Thái Lan, Hồng Kông, Đài Loan, Macao và bản tiếng Anh toàn cầu. Việt Nam chính là thị trường tiếp theo phát hành trò chơi chiến thuật đang cực kì thành công này.2. ĐẶC THÙ VÀ DUY NHẤT: BỘ TƯỚNG HỢP KÍCH – XUẤT CHIÊU BÍ TRUYỀNTrong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng, mỗi bộ tướng đều có duyên phận, không chỉ kích hoạt các chỉ số đặc biệt khi cùng có mặt trong trận hình, mà còn giúp nhân vật mạnh nhất trong bộ tướng đó thay đổi kĩ năng hoàn toàn mới để xuất tuyệt chiêu hợp kích Bí Truyền. Đây là tính năng chưa một game chiến thuật nào có trên thị trường Việt Nam hiện tại.3. THỜI TRANG QUYẾT ĐỊNH CHIẾN THUẬT – ĐỔI THỜI TRANG, ĐỔI KĨ NĂNGHệ thống thời trang của Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng không chỉ đẹp, “khủng” mà còn đem đến những chỉ số, hiệu ứng thuộc tính và bộ kỹ năng mới đặc thù trên từng bộ thời trang. Vì vậy, khi thay đổi thời trang, nghĩa là người chơi sẽ thay đổi hoàn toàn đặc tính và chiến thuật của trận hình. Đặc biệt, các bộ thời trang này không được cộng dồn thuộc tính, khiến cho trò chơi trở nên trí tuệ hơn nhiều.5. GIẢI ĐẤU ĐỈNH PHONG – VINH DANH TẠC TƯỢNG LIÊN SERVERĐây là tính năng PvP thi đấu liên server trong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng, nơi hội tụ tất cả những game thủ mạnh nhất tại các server, tham gia tranh tài để tìm ra người chiến thắng. Giải đấu được tổ chức như một vòng chung kết WorldCup, thi đấu chia bảng và các vòng đấu cực kỳ hấp dẫn. Ngoài danh hiệu, được tạc tượng liên server, người chơi tham gia giải đấu sẽ nhận thưởng điểm tích lũy dùng để đổi lấy các mảnh tướng Đỏ siêu hiếm. Người chơi khác cũng có thể ủng hộ, bình chọn và cổ vũ những người chơi tham gia giải đấu để nhận thưởng nhiều phần quà giá trị.6. 37 HIỆU ỨNG – TÙY HỨNG TRẬN HÌNH – SO TRÌNH CHIẾN THUẬTChiến thuật trong Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng được thay đổi liên tục thông qua các hiệu ứng kĩ năng của tướng như tăng tốc, hóa đá, đóng băng, thiêu đốt, x2 sát thương… Các hiệu ứng này sẽ ảnh hưởng mạnh mẽ đến cách chơi và cách bố trận của game thủ sao cho hiệu quả nhất, từ đó phân định đẳng cấp trí tuệ của người chơi.7. HỆ THỐNG PET ĐA DẠNG, BUFF HIỆU ỨNG TĂNG CHỈ SỐ CHO TƯỚNGTiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng là một trong số hiếm các game chiến thuật có sử dụng hệ thống Pet khi xuất trận. Các Pet này khi xuất chiến sẽ cộng chỉ số khá lớn cho tướng trong đội hình bao gồm cả hiệu ứng. Mỗi Pet sẽ có các chỉ số riêng tùy thuộc vào chiến thuật của người chơi mà tùy biến sử dụng loại Pet hợp lý khi xuất trận. Pet cũng là một trong những thứ có thể show hàng thể hiện sự độc đáo, oai phong cho nhân vật.8. BẠN SẼ KHÔNG CÔ ĐƠN KHI CHƠI GAMEMặc dù là game thẻ tướng chiến thuật Tam Quốc, thế nhưng Tiểu Tiểu Ngũ Hổ Tướng không hề “tự kỉ” khi có rất nhiều tính năng cộng đồng cho phép tương tác giữa người  chơi với nhau. Với hệ thống bang hội đặc sắc, bang chiến khốc liệt, tổ đội tinh anh, vận tiêu bang hội, công thành chiến, phụ bản liên server, voice chat liên server… thì bạn sẽ không thể cảm thấy cô đơn khi tham gia vào game.

        "Ive been playing this for a year and a half and i can say this game is NOT a pay to win. Pull rates are pretty much the same as in any other game, and units are tradable 90% of the time so its possible to get units you want even if youre not lucky enough to get them from packs. Platinum units are super helpful and are now much easier to get thanks to golden medals which are pretty easy to get in events. Theres different events, some are for unions, some you play for yourself. Also, a game with most friendly users ive met in games, willing to give a lot of help and advice to new players. All in all, ive played for a long time and i dont see myself stopping any time soon unless theres drastic changes",
        "I love this game. Though they don't explain how to obtain platinum medals or how unions work very well. And I would like it if we could exchange 7s units better. I could list 10 units I'd rather have then idun. I would love to exchange her for a Gilles de rais or a fenrir. But no I have to keep this unit I don't want. Because my idun can't even be sold on the bazaar. Though those are my only problems. I'm addicted to this game.",
        "It's really a good game. I've been playing this for a long time. The reason I didn't give 5 star is because there is a player who start arguing with the other player for no reason and i hope i can report this to the game developer but my friend say it would never work.",
        "I've been encountering some problems with the game in terms of going through a quest. It just suddenly bonked me out of the game everytime i get to the boss. I've tried clearing the cache  and reinstalling it but  to  no avail.  I'm using an oppof1s  and whether I connect through  Wi-Fi or other means. It does the same thing. Would like some help with this",
        "I have two copies of this 7* card that is essential to my deck at the moment. Unfortunately they screech this annoying Yossshh yaattaadaraa!!!!!! EVERY freaking time they launch a special. Then freaking golden apples fill up the screen. Unfortunately they are two of my strongest cards. Thinking of dropping this game.",
        "Been playing for a long time seeing the game develop but as of recently when they switched to parade. Pay to play has been so heavily support worse than other games from the platinum club or vip to basically making it impossible to win or even compete without spending money in events especially when they make event units untradable this has not happened for 2 years the game has been out and now they r just plain greedy this game is committing game suicide and it was such a great game before but now they always have their hands out for money its really disappointing."

        "This is just amazing! Once you get started it gets a little tough, but you can have other people help you if your stuck. I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",
        "I absolutely love this game, and have never had any issues with it. but today it froze on the loading screen when connecting to an online match, I had to force restart my phone and now everytime I try to start the app it stays stuck on the loading screen until it times out. I love this game please fix so I can continue playing and rate 5 stars.",
        "I'm only putting it as one star in hopes the devs see this, but please find a better way to recover accounts. I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out."

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "A good graphics for a good beginning franchise. A well tame game for an anime base. But my concerns on playing this game is sometimes ita forcing crash. (I thought this was a high end game so basically you need a good phone that can handle a game like this) im looking forward for better improvements such as more charcaters to come. And much more sfx. Big thumbs up for this game.",
        "Great game and graphics. Need to work on the optimization though as constant crashes occurs. Will also be thrilled to see rework on Yomo as he looks really plain in this game. Character collision and ability lock in also needs improvement, especially those with dashes which will be better to have single target lock in. Overall as a TG fan I love this game.",
        "The game is absolutely amazing ^^ This is definitely one of the better start up games in the app store. I would love to see more improvement with the graphics, load time, and effects. I can't wait to see the characters that will be added next. If I may I'd like to suggest that everyone's eyeball fascinated mask maker be added. Uta is definitely one of my favorite characters and it's a shame Yomo was implemented but not Uta. Many wishes for this game ^^",
        "I have been waiting for someone to make a Tokyo ghoul game now here it is. What can I say about this game other then its awesome I love it , but I do wish they would add more characters and maybe add some from the Tokyo ghoul re manga but anyways awesome game. Now someone needs to make a my hero academia game then a one piece game and I'll be happy.",
        "Had been really enjoying this game despite the consistent crashes.  Now; however, the game won't even start.  It stays stuck on the beginning loading screen.  Please fix and I will update my review.  EDIT:  issue fixed.  Looks like it was maintenance they didn't bother announcing until after the fact.  Love the game so still 5 stars but would be nice to have to some advance notice with these things.",
        "Ok, as fun as this game is, it has a lot of problems. Severe lagging during missions and crashing, just to name the few. On top of that, lately I can't even start up the game, cuz I get stack on the loading screen before I can even log in into the server. Very disappointed. There's hoping the devs will fix that issue soon, since this game shows a lot of potential."

        "Great game!!! Still some bug's. You have to log out and log back in to collect the 5 hour daily rewards. Sometimes you can't post in the chat rooms. It will say invalid character. A lot of lag at times when you use the power and impact gauge. There needs to be more options to customize character's and or add more. I also believe the daily 5 hour rewards need to change instead of the same rewards everyday. It is a fun game, and highly addictive. Great graphics, which still could be improved on, looking at newer golf games coming out.",
        "Great game.  Only problem is the huge 10 second warning that covers your shot.   Also the game meter jumps.  So I get penalties for taking longer than 10 seconds when I let the control bar reset.",
        "Almost great. The UI is a crowded mess. Too much nonsense. The equipment tabs are broken due to bugs(I downloaded on several devices) making it impossible to accurately navigate between items, and the putting is rigged(obvious padding) resulting in missed shots that shouldn't happen. Besides these glaring flaws there is great potential here.",
        "A great game easy to play and progress.  Only issue is i can't work out how to change my country from the usa to aus. Sick to death of my putts begging taken off me because you have ridiculously stupid gamer play.  If I putt a ball in real life and it hits the edge of a cup it goes in 90 pc of the time.  If I putt one to the lip of the cup in real life it goes ohm.  But bout your retarded physics.  They stop the ball on the edge or knock it away from the hole. What a load of bulls$/^. Fix this and I may consider upping the rating",
        "I really like this game other than the BIRDS IN THE BACKGROUND!!! Shut them up PLEASE!!! It's very annoying and makes me not want to play this game I have to play it with the volume turned down so I don't have to hear the freaking BIRDS!",
        "Fine before the update. Now it glitches and freezes. Cannot finish a round. Power bar no longer smooth. Not enjoyable to play. I wanted to quit in the middle of the round. Very disappointed in latest update. I hope this is fixed soon. This was my favorite game on mobile device ever and I want to go babe to playing it!"

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

In a game that involves the collection of various characters, it can be disheartening to spend money on this game and still not get the tsum tsum you want,  even during the so-called \"lucky times\". I recommend keeping your money in your wallet since it is unlikely that you collect the ones that you want, when you want them.   There is also a minor glitch in loading the game, but if you try multiple times, it will eventually load.",

I played that more than 10 times but I didn't win 2 rounds so I just came here and wrote this review... And if you think I'm a noob.. then yes I am but only in this chapter not in previous ones..",

The multiplayer option is also great and chest opening is such a treat. One worry is that the weapon below the primary weapon is still locked (why I don't know), otherwise the game is superb. Graphics are top notch and fighting doesn't come more realistic than that!"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Update: Now it won't even open. Once you find out your progression is rigged, the fun wears off. You will have a win streak going, them \"mysteriously\" a machine will show up with just the right set up to beat yours. Then once you finally get the right configuration to beat that one (however long that takes) another machine with the perfect set up to beat yours shows up again preventing you from progressing. Over and over and over....",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete."

        "MotoG5plus/Ipega9021  Amazing game, better than I remember (original Xbox) No lag what so ever and all graphics are maxed, looks much better than Xbox version. Works great with an Ipega 9021 Bluetooth controller. Loading times are so much better than they were back in the day. Don't miss this definitive version San Andreas! Snapdragon 625/Tegra 4 will easily Max the graphics. Tegra 4 will give around 2 hours of gameplay, SD625 will give around 5 hours of gameplay. It will use around 600 MB of RAM at Max settings if you have it free",
        "i bought this game on my samsung galaxy s4 octa core version and it looks more of lagplay and not gameplay. this is dejecting as rockstar games has failed to optimise this game for android devices. it is recommended that they make necessary improvements and make the game playable for medium to high end devices. i have 4gb internal storage out of 16gb free yet the game lags, even on low settings like 0% resolution and draw distance .",
        "This game is so old school and gta 5 is so much better than this game but it is still worth playing. It has a lot of cheats and hacks but it is still very good. It plays up very x1000000 rare. This game is very fun and if you have seen my comment please download this game immediately because it's extremely fun and it is very easy to collect money ps its okay to play offline and if you have seen my comment i recommend you to download this game immediately and have a great time",
        "I loved this game wh3n I was young and this brings back the best memories of my child hood haha.. the controls are kinda lumpy when steering a vehicle. But all other movements are pretty good. Butt,if you happen to have a Xbox one s controller it works perfect on my galaxy s8 plus. Thanks for porting this game to android and giving the option to max the graphics out. Looks very good! Loving the portal game feel too haha!",
        "Just started, i am playing with an Xbox One controller and everything works perfect.  The only problem is you are stuck with the original controls and cant change the buttons functions.  I wish i could use the triggers for gas and braking for driving the cars like in GTA's 4 and 5.  Other than that everything is good.  A classic game, that runs smoothly, and is a great time nostalgia trip.   This one works so well that i am definitley buying the other ports as soon as i am done with this one.",
        "Game could be grate Game looks awesome but the controls don't work right. Walking and running is not fluid. It's stop and go. While driving it is very hard to steer while pressing the gas pedal. I have Max Payne and the controls in that are great what happened with GTA San Andreas. Please fix. Also could you make it so I can move the game to my SD Card. I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 4."

Spin for hope for for free spin, those free spin stuck for 30min or 200spin never come.. Once u hit free spin just hope can win back.. But is no 10% win back from u lose.. Sometime more worst u will get no win in the free spin.. Those daily quest more funny show that have reward.. But if u do the quest ur balance is even that consider lucky.. Not a reward at all better don't do.. Once the quest needs that will stuck or make u lose more to success.. Those customer service is not helpful.. Always reply the same thing is like auto reply system. Betting make higher never notice but daily spin reward never adjust high.. Customer service always reply oh u have hit big win, have free spin, though US is stupid. Sometime game problem what is quest succeed but no reward get but always is player problem.. They won't try find out what game problem only advise player to restart, Line not good.. Like all is player problem. This game make player angry.. Don't purchase the chip to play is feel more better."

After 2-3 years, getting a mid range mobile, I installed the game once again to try it on my new android & guess what, it WORKED Flawlessly! (On Moto G5 plus) and also, thanks a lot for giving me Rewards as a returning user back to Kritika. Love you guys, you are awesome. Keep developing XD(Request: like orders & chaos 2, please try to give a open world look) thanks once again.",
        "I'll give it 5 star if only I can Recover my account. I forgot my password then when i asked Gamevil support, there so many requirement. I can't provide CS ID because I can't log in to the game anymore. Hope they can fix this. Best gameplay but sad account recovery system.",
        "Keep closing randomly on some missions on both my S8 and galaxy tab S2. Starting to get annoying.  Waste resources when it closes.  I uninstalled n install and that didn't solve the annoying problem. Waste resources anytime it force closes",
        "The game keeps kicking me out everytime i play. I cant play because the game crashes it takes me out of the game fix that and i will give it all stars it also gives me errors in the game itself for examples stamina error and free draw error I stopped playing the game because it kicks me out to much. This game crashes for android any android phone I don't understand.",
        "Server Issue!!!  Please fix your server! I'm really angry/pressured play your game! Especially event time. My connection it's really great! But why i'm always disconnected during play your game. The game is good, only the server. If you guys want people continue play your game. Do something about this. I hopefully, this problem fix as soon as possible!.",
        "A good game but can not download the latest patch after updating. I am a VIP and leader of a guild so this is troubling so until this issue is fixed the game gets just a star from me. The game has gotten worse tried to play after creating a new character and the game crashed on me, seriously gamevil you are slipping and it's a shame"

The game creators could give 2 sh/ts about what is going on .",

Problems free=5 stars.. What happen? I cannot even play the game now.. I once install and play and later uninstall because of game problem. Now I install and try to play again. I cannot play.. What is the problem? I also want to recover my account too..",
        "Gameplay and graphics is great BUT as you progress you spend more time upgrading units and buildings. Some upgrades take up to a week of upgrading rendering those villagers useless aswell as the rate at which resources comes in as you collect doesnt compensate enough for the costs of upgrades. Its unnecessarily STRETCHED OUT. because of this its a 3 star rating...DONT DOWNLOAD IF YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE. Been playing a year and i dont feel my progress is a representation of the time i have put in. Been playing almost daily!",
        "If you are going to do updates on this game, at least MAKE SURE it isn't lagging! My game since the update has been freezing up and lagging to the point that I select something (a wall for example) and the whole  game freezes and takes a million years just to LOAD. If this game isn't fixed, I'm demanding all my money spent on the game refunded and uninstallment. Not happy.",
        "This is the exact definition of a strategy game, the controls are great and its free. You get to choose your own nation which just adds to the strategy, plus whatever you do in a battle can affect the entire battle. I would recommend it to people who want something with strategy and a bit of hardcoreness. The learning curve is quite steep sometimes."

As a mobile game it's nothing much, but throw this on steam and it would rival Binding of Isaac. All in all a great, smooth and challenging game! I definitely recommend it!",
        "Hay soul knight! Good game! The 4 player thing is a good update, but the next update is more of a hard 1 to think of is it? it like its has no more to improve :( But I have a idea! Why not have gun skins! Most gun games have gun skins! But its up to you to do it or not. P.S. I have tested a PS4  controller and it WORKS! Did u add it or is it a gust a random thing? Thx",
        "Five stars! I don't give good reviews  unless I like the game, with Google play that's becoming kind of rare so having a breath of fresh air like this is truly amazing. One thing that this game just different from just about every other game on Google Play is that it doesn't Force ads on you! Instead it will offer you an add for currency or an extra life, purely by choice not by shoving it down your throat! The art style is so old-school and I love it, not to mention that the wepons are insane!!! I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this, keep up the good work ChillyRoom! :D",
        "Great game! Very addicting as well...  But Multiplayer-wise: This game needs to be more optimized for slower devices in order to avoid Server Crashes/Lags, and also needs to improve on the Multiplayer Connection difficulty... Then last but not least, could you make a SEPARATE Save File for Multiplayer Games? Seriously, it bugs me when my friends and I save a game to continue the next day without being able to play at all unless if I want the Save File to be lost.",
        "I saw this game earlier back in 2017, but was reluctant to try it. Though I'm very glad I decided to try it out today, because the first several minutes were pretty awesome. The music on the title especially got me hyped to play. I'll probably be keeping this one for a while.",
        "Would've put 4 stars but I have problems playing multiplayer. Whenever a multiplayer game starts,  our phones would suddenly go back to the home screen for some reason. Pls help or at least explain"

        "Love this little game! I wish we had five life's, Three just gets me started. But overall, it's a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don't make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!",
        "Very hard and not as fun as the other games but  because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I've noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level. The most amazing part of this game are the graphics.  Awesome really awesome.  Very well done. Still playing this game but also still cannot convince my friends to get out of CC and other games. Will keep on trying though.",
        "This game is set up to STEAL a certain number of lives before you can win a level. Some levels, like Venice, level 79 may never be won. I have bought extra lives twice, extra moves twice, I REFUSE to make anymore purchases. If this was a truly user friendly game, it would BANK any extra moves, lighting, and other bonuses you've earned but did not use. But no, it throws them out. STEALS what you have earned. BANK it for me, I earned it, I should get to keep it. I'm done with this game.",
        "I am glad for the staff at big fish they did a wonderful job getting me back play after all my levels where lost.. They found them all and it made me happy that i can play where i was.. I can not play to often sometimes and had taken me a long time but look forward to every new city i get to open a new and all the challenges i get to participate in.  Thank you all for this game",
        "Fantastic game!  I love the graphics and interesting bits of trivia shared every time a landmark is built.  I also like the extra daily challenges and the special events that open up every so often.  Gummy Drop is challenging but can be played without needing to make any in-app purchases.  One con: the game starts you with three lives (lives replenish after 20 minutes), but in order to permanently increase your lives to five, you must pay $10.",
        "Surprisingly fun! I was setting the ads for this game everywhere but thought they were really unappealing. Work on your ads a little to emphasize the fun prizes for completing levels, the enjoyable hunt for tour letters in old levels, the history of the buildings you save! So many great things happening in this game."

        "Awesome game with a cool soundtrack, the gameplay itself isn't too challenging and has room for strategy. The only downside as far as I can tell is the terrible multiplayer system which doesn't even work most of the time. But overall this game is a great time waster and very enjoyable.",
        "Good graphics. Good units. Awesome skills. Nice drawings. All in all, this is a really good game 😁👍👌But I have a problem. It keeps stopping everytime I open it. And I've also been addicted to this game for more than a month now 😄",
        "It's been a year since I've last played this, still fun. I've been playing this from day to night as far as I could remember. Hopefully, the bugs where the downloading restarts are solved. Nice Gameply as ever, getting hooked to this once again.",
        "This game is fun and addictive. I like that you don't have to work very hard to get decent leveled characters, and having everyone be overpowered makes the game fun. My only problem is how multiplayer is a little wonky sometimes, mainly when the app suddenly freezes during a battle.",
        "Feels satisfying and stress-free , cute characters too. I just have one problem, when it gives me a notifications of free polygons or similar to that, I go check but I don't get anything. There appears nothing in my giftbox.",
        "Great graphics and music and very f2p friendly for a gachapon game. Lots of banners with guaranteed top tier units so if you follow the Discord or Reddit community's advice on when to pull, you can make the free gems go a long way. The more characters you have, the more quests you can do to get more characters, so it may seem slow in the beginning but eventually your character collection will snowball until you have more waifus than you know what to do with!"

You guys always claim how much you appreciate your players, why not show your appreciation by increasing the number of spins a player can win from 5 to 8, 8 to 10 and so on. Now that would be a great update  (without making it more difficult to win free spins) that all players would appreciate & it will make your game more fun to play. Knew U wouldn't respond.",

        "Great balance between encouraging players to support the game through purchasing gold AND rewarding them for playing.  Plenty of attention is given to players who do not want to spend real money,  as you can make 5-10$ equivalent in gold per day watching ads and playing the game, not to mention the free chests you get a few times/day. The offers from the chests only ask for 5$, a very fair price for the goodies you receive.   The buildings and landscapes are beautiful and detailed. There is a wide selection of buildings and the cities really come to life.  This is a great game to relax when you have a few minutes of downtime, I'm dont play many city builders but this is one of the best.",

        "This is an updated version. My last post was from I think September or maybe October, but this game is truly AMAZING!!! The story line itself is great as well as the side story's that you can read as well. This game has changed so much from when I started playing this game in August. The events are great but I think the developers can give a little bit better rewards then just XP juice and more jewels as well as heart stamina, but other than that the game is perfect no glitches and non of that stuff. The one year anniversary was amazing thank you for that!! I can't wait for season 10 and the future seasons of Moe Ninja Girls!!!",
        "There really isn't anything negative to say about \"Moe! Ninja Girls\" the story is great, every character is deep and likeable, even if you're a free player each chapter is long enough to keep you coming back and paying is definitely worth it,too. It looks great and sounds great to boot. I honestly don't like mobile games at all but this is amazing and would be even it were a console or pc game. To me this is THE perfect app on mobile so download it now! And devs: I hope you continue to support the game because if you guys keep making seasons,I'll keep playing. Love you guys! &lt;3",
        "The story is really the best part of the whole game. The ninja fighting seems to be arbitrary , as you can have high stats and still lose a match. Collecting new gear is fun but you don't get as much new gear as you would like. Sometimes the game stretches the abilities of my Amazon fire eight and crashes under Google Play add in. This story definitely makes it worthwhile playing though it's funny and titillating!  ;-)",
        "Amazing story! Great characters. Other similar apps dont compare. Im playing completely free so far, just finished Season 1, and many awesome event stories. Well worth my time. Yes you have to wait 4 hours between chapters, but who cares. Its actually a nice pace.",
        "Cute anime girls. Only things is that the gameplay was really simple. I've played some dating games before and usually there's more options or they appear more frequently. And the ninja fight mini game was also simple. I don't know. This game seems to get good reviews so maybe it's just me.",
        "The game's quite sensational! You wouldn't believe how hooked I am to this game when I finally found it then played it. The story is quite good, the cast are very unique. All in all, a great game. Oh, it would be nice to add some mini-games that allow players to gain nineys/gems other than the ninja fights. Also, there were some hick-ups with some of the dialogues where the words don't make sense but it's still readable."

As you spend your days busy with girls and club activities, you start to discover the true identities of your fellow club members... Can you unmask your favorite girl&apos;s identity?

She always thinks positively, though sometimes she is too starry-eyed. Active, athletic, and relatively smart, she livens up the party, while also sometimes getting herself and the people around her in trouble. She admires ninjas and comes up with the idea to set up a &quot;Ninja Seeking Club&quot;.<br><br>Enju Saion-ji &#x2013; &#x201C;Oh well... If you&apos;re having trouble, I suppose I can tell you whatever you need to know.&#x201D;<br>A classmate of yours. She is a member of the student council and is smart as well as agile. Can seem commanding at times, but is actually caring by nature, so she takes care of Akari despite often being dragged into trouble by her. Does not show people how she lives her private life. Rumor says she comes from a millionaire family.<br><br>Ricka Machiyuki &#x2013; &#x201C;No problem. Don&apos;t think about who is behind you. Just take your lessons.&#x201D;<br>A classmate of yours, who transferred right after you. Always stays quiet and poker-faced, creating a mysterious mood around her. From time to time she says things that sound unsettling, but her classmates hope that she is only joking. Likes video games.

        "Incredible mobile game, even for older gamers! Incredible mobile game, one of the first fully realized AAA titles on Android.  No stupid IAP, micro-transactions or paywalls after initial purchase.  Vast, procedurally-generated worlds with numerous biomes and biome-specific items, bosses and events, making for great replayability.  A deep, relaxing game of crafting and building OR a PVE game OR multiplayer. Even has a great tutorial and cloud save to sync across devices.  Playing on Nexus 6p and I have no problems with controls, even as an older gamer.",
        "Hey,  so this is gonna longish review... what I have to say about this is while  it is similar to Minecraft in the way that it is open world it is a completely different game. It has the graphics of your old 16 bit Dungeon Crawler games in a huge and immersive environment that is always changing. As a PC player of the game I can say that I am pleased with the port over onto mobile devices. I wouldn't ask for anything different!",
        "PLEASE Fix it. First I Love this game, only I can't access the game online. No cloud saves, no multiplayer, I got this to play with my son and so my kids can play together. Would love to give the app full star's, please fix this so that I can. All that asides its still a lot of fun, still recommend this highly. Just got to update what I said, now I can't even access the game. All the gear that I've made/found is gone if I have to reinstall. If I didn't like the game I wouldn't mind but I do, so it's only disappointed me more. PLEASE fix this so that I can play this awesome game with my son before I fined another great game we can play together on our phones. Maybe I'll start with that minecraft game he's going on about.......",
        "Great game, and enjoyable by whole family on local multiplayer. Terraria PE has come a long way since its early days. Waiting for new updates. The only issue I've seen is that for some reason 360 Security flags this as a trojan malware possibly due to so many access permissions that Terraria asks for. Devs this is something you may want to clear with them. Otherwise keep up the good work.",
        "I LOVE the game but you need more bosses And wepons that you can forge together to get unique wepons and armor (like say you want the special effect from one armor set but you want the def fom another you could forge then together and get the special effect and the def). You also might want to add a extremely hard boss like duke fishron, but lots of them! It would add so much play time onto the game, but you would like i said earlier new armor add tools.",
        "I've played this game since elementary school till now, I'm still fall in love playing this game. Even though sometimes it gets salty when you lose something or the bug, but... Idfc =D. For the devs, could you add more stuff from PC to this mobile version ? It'll be cool to have chimney and other good looking decorations for the house"

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "This rpg is best so far.. I've tried many rpgs like avabel,  toram etc.. This is the best so far...with great controls.. i love it.. But it would have been better if we can fully inspect other players... Also PVP for pvp players coz most of the rpg players are up for pvp instead of pve.. I hope u'll fix it. :) sorry for my bad english lol.. And this is the first time i wrote a review XD.. Love this game..",
        "Amazing game, loads of fun. if I could just control it better. this game is great! it's got really good graphics and it's an acceptable MMORPG. especially for on-the-go, in your hands, and your phone, it's great. however the controls are really rough, I can't really move and turn my camera at the same time; and that is what really gets me. it takes me out of the game when my camera doesn't work well with trying to attack and move my camera and trying to move and jump at the same time.",
        "Yea this game is awesomeness!!.  I've been playing for about two months and unfortunately it's already getting repetitive. All the running around without mounts is boring and I think you desperately need to introduce dungeons and a solid PVP system.  I'm really liking the characters, graphics and the controls are out of this world awesome. The man quest is fun but the side quest need some work. Thx guys and Please please, considering adding to the game.",
        "OK been playing for a week now & can rate this a 5* all them way! Graphics are awesome, story is cool. Run's smooth on my tablet. The download was huge but worth it in all the bonuses they give you after, wow! When I hit B.W.T. and said I need to download more I sighed loudly haha. Then got the bonus stuff and the game is just cool. Pat yourselves on the back nice job!!!",
        "Asobimo strikes again! Combined from the unreal engine graphic and asobimo's creativity, this game really gives what its promise. The graphic is amazing, the gameplay is addicting and story is interesting. Unlike the others MMORPG in the play store in which almost every game have exactly same gameplay with only the UI and Characters that make them different.. the tittle as well lol This game is far different from those \"crappy\" games. Worth a try and worth your time. the size of the game is kinda huge tho it means the game has quality!",
        "This game was awesome, though the download was lengthy. I would love to give a better rating, but after I reach chapter two the game stops. I can't get it past the part where I pick which character I want to play. Overall, when they fix this, It will be awesome! I was actually able to choose everything for my character, attributes, looks, etc. The only thing I have wished so far is that there were different races to choose from as well. If they did that, this would overall be the best game I've ever played, from game consoles and all."

Started buying DBs to support you...please include free ssr tickets for 50 and above DB purchase! Sr+ tickets for 40 DBs and less.  You'll have more buyers if you do that. Keep it up!",
        "Nice game to play,very addictive. Unfortunately there's so many bugs in the game,such as freeze suddenly (can't click aything in game),sometimes game ended before 45 min (often ends in 29 min) and force close issue (not responding). Please fix this bug ASAP. Much appreciated. Thanks.",
        "i dont know what to say... i feel grateful for your march event log in bonus. New & old player can snatch 1 SSR player but this new event though why you make it more depressing feature ? i figure playing this game is like working to get money.... i thought this game suppose to be fun and bring childhood memories, i know you need effort to get gold ticket but this \"effort\" is all based on luck already see many people day 1 got 0 gold ticket day 2 got 5 gold ticket...... just how? seriously if u want to make new event at least make it friendly for user i dont see point to play this game all night long to get that rewards your just making people to stay aeay from your game not attracting them shame event",
        "the game is just awsome but it has many cracks. the problem now is that matches don't start they keep loading forever this all happens when the photos in the missions menu appear white space. i don't even know the reason behind it ! i would rate the app 5 stars if it got fixed.  everytime this happens i have to reinstall the app",
        "Remind me of childhood anime.. Good game but have some minor bugs as far as I played.. Should be add ability to substitute players in middle of match, not only when half time rest.. Maybe some dribble or combination attack skill should be used to pass multiple players and get our player closer to the keeper. Please add more story match. Also fix regular online match, it's always freeze.",
        "Never watched the anime but played the game on snes and was a fan ever since. Its great to see it alive. Just wish it wasn't so much pay to win."

Even if it was massively  over priced. Would be even better if you could save load outs for weapons and perks.",

Lastly, whoever makes the daily challenges needs to stop, they are practically impossible to beat and the reward isn't that great.",
        "Good game, but I'm stuck in the title screen for a week. I tried reinstalling over and over but doesn't work. Moreover, players who had issues about the internet connectivity problems of while they're watching an ad and letting your opponent to win in multiplayer. Not only that but the Super Block Meter is keeping a lot buggy. Fix these problems now."

And the game is the best ever also check out my level it's called china666. IDK why I named it that, the icons are cute just to say. I think everyone in the USA should play this!",
        "Awesome! I can play this game to make levels, play levels, friend people, And customize the avatar! Also, you can play the main levels! This game is really fun to play! And the last thing I was gonna say: You get user coins in levels, Secret coins in main levels and stars in main levels and other levels!Also you get orbs and diamonds on new best. And if you complete main levels! This game is so good. You get colors too! Everyone should play this and never delete it. This is one of my favorite games I was ever playing in my whole entire life! I will play this everyday since this game is so amasing and cool. I will play it already like now. And I like 2.1! And I liked 2.0. But when will will 2.2 be here? In 1 year! So let's keep playing until robtop makes 2.2. But I don't need to wait for 2.2! Cause I don't know what will happen in 2.2 but let's see!",
        "I swear this is one of the best games you could ever play it involves timing but the soundtracks are amazing almost infinite user created levels and 22 regular levels to play. Subzero and Meltdown plus geometry dash world all offer free content that is including light but this is 100% worth the price that it is listed for. Even though I'm not like a certified critic I would still recommend this to anyone 5 and up to whatever age",
        "It is awesome, and you should get it.  Geometry Dash Lite, I mean.  The idea itself is not originally theirs, but they dominated it when they used it.  The music is also amazing, and the fact that you can try making your own level is just even better.  Also, if you did not know, it has levels that are not in the free version.  So there you go, my review",
        "This game is awesome!!!!!!! You can make levels, icons, and other cool stuff!! If you were reading this rate description I hope download this game. :) Now im a bit concerned that now every time i get on a online level it freezes. Please fix this and ill give you back 5 stars. Really now when i click on begginer pack on map packs they're hard",
        "2.11... a great update for icons and change. But. I am now missing 19 of each shard and only 18 ice shards for whatever reason. I wish that didnt need to happen but oh well. Also if a level doesn't exist any more you can't delete your comments off of it. Other that that I love this amazing game. #Rubrub"

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks.",
        "This game will cheat you! I  upgraded a bunch of my characters but the next time I logged in nothing had saved! The funds I used to upgrade were also gone, of course. Don't waste money buying anything because the upgrades you make just disappear."

        "Brings Back Fond Memories I love this game! I spent countless hours playing this in the early 2000s. The controls are easy enough to understand and the text is legible on my LG V10. I don't if I'd be able to read it on a smaller screen, they are not kidding when they say this is meant for tablets. If you've got a tablet or phablet I can't recommend this game enough.",
        "A classic perfectly adapted to the phone platform This game is a MUST-have for any rpg lover. The D&D mechanics may seem i bit weird in the beginning, but you will learn in time. The replayability value of this game is almost infinite. Personally I have never played any kind of game that would allow me to play as many hours in so many different ways. The game excels in its easy to handle mechanics, fun dialogue, compelling story, great ammount of side-quests that are actually enjoyable. Hands down best Apk for this platform. Worth every penny.",
        "Great Classic CRPG BGII was definitely a breakthrough in its time, but it still holds charm and depth that many newer games can't even touch. I have this game for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and I can tell the chip set on the phone is grinding gears with the games engine. It's playable but only when the right character menu is minimized but it still gets choppy when multiple spells are being  cast. With the specs on the s7 this shouldn't be the case. Hey Developers any input/ advice on how to solve this issue?",
        "Amazing! There's a lot to love.  First, if you played the original, this is just as good with extras.  Granted, it's a bit harder to see everything, but it's what happens when you take a computer game and make it available for a phone.  Beamdog has brought additional characters, adventures, magic items, portraits and voices to the game to expand the character creation.  Some expansions are dull (like the arena unless you love grinding) but more of this rpg is on the way.  It's truly the best classic game reborn.",
        "I have a special request. I have purchased very possible version of the bg series, and have played as long as the game has existed. Call me a war vet asking for a wheel chair ramp but could you guys implement the imput of  points or the option to roll. 20+ years of rolling for stats has earnt me the option. Other than that perfect game, worth every licence for every platform. Either let us input stats with option to roll or make a shadowkeeper for android please.",
        "Game is great, as I've played it on another device. However on Note 8 it does not take up the whole screen, and the usable screen is significantly smaller than on s7 edge, and is barely playable. When I force it to full screen in settings, then touching on sides of screen are not recorded accurately. For example, when I try to resize the text box, it toggles AI instead. Makes the game virtually unpayable."

        "Its really fun! A lot of new chaeacters, events, encounters and strategy! A must try game for any card lover out there also the art is lovely, can't get enough on how awesome they look with every character.  ~~admin help me, I can't login to my account for some reason.",
        "Great game! The only thing I can think of to make it better would be to have a google+ login. Some of us prefer not to bind to FB. But, all in all, great. Edit: cannot get daily login rewards \"abnormal time setting\" my date and time are consistent with where I live and I have not altered them in any way. (Auto set) Still no other way to bind account except Facebook. This will eventually get you a lower rating from me.",
        "At first looks simple and can just auto everything, but you'll eventually reach a point where strategy has a truly major impact on gameplay. Really well-made, only complaint is Gem Card gem bonus should be in Mail, not Daily Task, so busy people can maintain their purchases. Edit: Also the potions used should not be deducted if disconnected in middle of battle. Kinda expensive to keep restocking certain potions.",
        "The game is good... but 100k download is suck atatistic for a 2 year old game.... u guys need new user base... dont u guys advertise in google network ads or adwords at least.... even brave frontier got 10 mil download from playstore",
        "i think this game is so great.the story line,the grapichs,the gameplay,everythink is great. except one: LOGIN!! why must use FB account??? why not google account or use ur own system???.who was play this game too but he's login use guest account cause he doesn't FB account,and when te app update he loss his all data in his account.he was level30 squad when that.he very disappointing and stop play this game again.now just me who play this game until now",
        "As a f2p gamer i find this game quiet balanced. Not too overpowering privileges for cashiers makes it an enjoyable game. Been playing for 2 years. One thing that concern me is that i wish there are chat notification 'cuz i find it hard to communicate with my guildmates. And also there is the combat system which is a piece of shit actually because i have a warrior squad with 6.2k power just lost in the job change level 6 with 5.5k squad power which is frustrating considering the big power gap. Please reduce the difficulty in accordance of the recommended squad power and maybe i will have a better opinion on this game"

        "Plarium do not like Aussies. They charge us extra money for offers.   A top end offer is $100 USD for the Americans. Which is $120-125 AUD after currency conversion for Australians. Yet for some reason our offers are $160 AUD. $35 AUD more then we should be paying.   I do not know how this practice has gone without incident as I thought there were supposed to be good anti descrimination laws and consumer laws in place that prevent the charging of extra to countries just because they do not like that country.   This is a morally disgusting practice as it is the same concept as charging more to others purely on the basis because they have a different skin colour, gender or religion.   I want to know why Australians are paying an extra $35 AUD then we should be as other mobile games. One example being Battle Mobile do the correct currency exchange rate and only charge $125 AUD after conversion from $100 USD. If other mobile games do it correctly why are Plarium choosing not to?  Edit: @ Plarium employee who just lied in response to me. Plarium set all prices up themselves through Google Playstore. NOT Google.",

I have looked at my data usage for this game and it has used well over 2gb of data from 19 th February untill 19th March, a months data usage. Not pleased Abount it as I only play the game for short intervals.",

It was fun however I don't understand how to play it. With the right instructions I could probably do better. Maybe my son can explain it to me a little bettet.",

        "Tactical monsters is a great turn based strategy game. There's enough complexity to make it interesting but not so much that it's overwhelming. It has both single and multiplayer game mode options as well as fun challenges. Collecting cards is addicting and fun. Warning, it makes you want to play  more! One of my favorite things game is how fast it is. Battles are quick but still enjoyable. It is possible to do well in this game without paying. One last thing I like about this game is the support. The developers are constantly updating the game and fixing issues.",
        "Great game, but after the last update the game isn't stable, when you play pvp often the timer freezes and you can't do anything beside closing the game, or you just cant do any action, and then you miss your turn, please fix it, and I'll give it 5 stars because the game is really awesome. Problem solved!",
        "i uninstalled the game but i made sure to bound my account to googleplay however when i installed the game again i cant get my previous progress and have to start over again please fix this.... Overall the game is really good for people who like to play strategically.",
        "For a game called tactical monsters, I was unpleasantly surprised that most units are actually humans and not monsters. Fighting is very basic with only having melee and ranged arrows. No magic, no way to buff allies, not many choices in combat. Overall a very boring and lackluster tactics wanna be type game. Hexes for movement are also very small and no back button to take back moves. I would not recommend playing this on a phone at all- Reply to Camex Games: First, try using spell check next time. Second - I did play several missions past the \"tutorial\" and none of the units given had magic or skills that opened up the game past a hack n slash. Third - Its not my problem to play dozens of hours in your mediocre phone game waiting for it to get interesting. If your game isn't good within the first hour, no one wants to keep playing for the next 10 hours. Fourth - how many monsters you have hidden in the game is irrelevant, as the units you get at the beginning of the game are mostly human, in a game called Tactical MONSTERS. Fifth - Giving monsters 3 basic skills that don't offer much tactical option when you can't customize them, isn't interesting. Sixth -- Add a back button",
        "Game is awesome! One of the best tactics game I ever played, and I play those a lot. Would be a great implement if we could zoom in or out during battle, and also some little story on campaign would make it more enjoyable. 4.9*",
        "I can't open game it go on 100 and then say network problem so fix it my all friend are playing this game and reach much higher and my game is not starting 😢😢 plz plz plz fix it for me if no then sorry I had to uninstall it"

        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don't want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?"

        "To the guy that says stop bitching cuz it's free. Reviews are so they can get feedback to improve the game. What good is the game if you can only play 2 games a day? There are too many other games out there that are free that customers can get chips to play for hours. This game should take care of their loyal customers before they move on to some of the other games. So many have posted about the small amount of chips received and they added the spinning wheel, maybe by reading the reviews they are listening and trying to improve chances of getting more chips. If everyone continues to give low reviews, maybe just maybe they'll increase our chances to get more daily chips!",
        "Purchased 90 rockets pack. Explained to me how I used all 90 in one game? Smh, that's too much.. So y'all want ppl to purchase rockets each hand. Y'all can do better. Chip packages as well. Maybe u will get more to contribute to the game. Smh, better chip packages probably will definitely help this game. Especially the price of chips to play verses what the rooms payout... Really is at a disadvantage to players to even purchase.",
        "I usually love this game. However, today I decided to treat myself and purchase some chips to get the last two battle ships that I needed to get 800 chips. The game is so frigging rigged it's just sad. It took all 600 chips that I bought and all that I won trying to accomplish a goal.  I will NEVER purchase chips again, especially in this game.",
        "Most of my purchases lately have been strange disappearing chips and rockets i have spent SO much  money on this game!!! and another thing i could not access any games for 2 days now but it TOOK ALL MY CHIPS AGAIN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU IN REGARDS TO THIS.",
        "Good variety of games. Not many free chips once the first few rounds are played when compared to what the rounds cost. Be ready to buy, buy, buy if you aren't patient. They have added many more chances for free chips. Thank you guys.",
        "I love the game again.  I'd been struggling with glitches and now they're fixed  I'm especially loving the free chips you give sometimes daily!  I've become re-addicted to it!  The new format IS easier to see, but it gets slightly boring when the two cards you CAN daub don't get any numbers!  It looks as if you're phasing out the gems, which is fine with me; I'd rather have all free daubs, chips, and only a FEW coin power plays.  The free daubs make all the difference between winning and losing.  Also, would like to see winning bingos actually give me the items I need to complete rooms and for you to increase the daily chips for every completed room."

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "Very good game. Good graphics and easy game controls. I am a very good fan of Tekken and you give me a good game for my phone. The only thing is that is a little harder to get the caracters because you have to get 10/10 parts gems to get the caracters. In the controls if you can run without charging an attack and can give another single attack wile running thru the opponent it could be great. Other wise game is awesome thanks.",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard."

        "I really enjoy this game.  I play just before going to bed just to clear my thoughts of the day.  I play when I'm standing in line waiting on a purposely slow person as not to snap off. It's a good game for me.  I can give it 4⭐, an increase from previous rating.  8/13/17 Just about 2 years later from last rating. I'm still playing.  10/11/17: I continue to play this game with the added annoyance of the interactive advertisement.  I am to the point that i will purchase this game for a small fee (.99) just to get rid of the interactive advertisement.  Interactive advertisements are there but it's not a requred interaction.  They have added a timer.  Great job.",
        "The previous update seemed to have been rectified but it seems, 'old dogs cannot learn new tricks',  because they're at it again, this latest installment of updates has level 13 in an impassable position. The new Legend, Level 13, mission 3, \"Impassable!\". By the time you have passed the top half of the mission,  you don't gave enough goes to beat the level,  like I say, impassable which makes it impossible. Con!",
        "I am absolutely addicted to this game! It is by far my absolute favorite game on my phone EVER, hands down!!!   I'm always so excited when my energy is refilled. I'd play it all day if I could! ❤❤❤ this game!  Getting to new levels is always so exciting and it's challenging in a fun way. If you love puzzles or beating a witch that's trying to stop you, then this is the game for you!!  Thank you for this game! I recommend it to everyone!! 😅😆😆😃",
        "My favorite game...ever.. But noticed the latest update, the new feature where the wizard boy appears after you've completed a level, the flashing is Really hurting...",
        "Now a days while playing the game closes and a life is also lost. New levels should be added weekly instead of monthly.In spin the wheel many times the reward are not added. Pls fix the problem immediately of game closing and spin the wheel.",
        "The game is fun but it cheats way 2 much! I should have beat a level again and it made me lose. I'm almost to the point of deleting it. I was in level 195 with 1 move left 2 beat the witch. I only needed 3 and made a 5 move play and I lost again. This is about the 10th time I've lost due to this game cheating. I haven't deleted yet because I like it but if it cheats again I'm deleting it like the other games that cheat. Today 2/15/18 the game is still cheating. I watched 3 vids and it said I didn't watch until the end. Ugh this game is fun but I'm ready to say forget itttttttt bc I keep complaining and new issues keep arising and they aren't even responding."

Also cant wait to ride my bike when i get to that part. and great fun on the sk8t board and really is a joy controller support as well. thanks Rockstar GAMES for cool bmx bikes ! it would be nice idea to be able to customize bikes and skate boards we could only dream. thanks for all the effort that was put forth in this Rockstar title. some of the oldschool best.",
        "I thought it was going to be hard to manage this game with the touch controls etc but NO totally wrong, it's super easy as they've reworked them for IOS and Android and you can also customise them too, plus the game still looks great even after so many years. The only place I can say where it loses on performance for some weird reason(patch maybe?)is when you enter a bathroom(lol)but who the hell stays in the bathroom for the whole experience haha. I definitely recommend buying if your a fan of the game!",
        "A great port of a fantastic PS2 game with amazing graphics for a phone.  I play on the Galaxy S5 which is a pretty old phone and I only have to deal with small frame rate drops in high population areas in game. Other than that, the game is the same, amazing game I grew up playing on the PS2 and Wii. I would recommend buying the game.  ONE PROBLEM: I recently received a phone upgrade and went from using a Galaxy S5 to a Galaxy J7 and for whatever reason I can't play the game on a newer phone. Pretty strange to say the least.",
        "yes, the controls can be annoying at times but nothing a Moga gaming controller can't fix!! makes the gaming experience a WHOLE LOT BETTER!! Love this game cus it's a ps2 classic always loved it!! ALWAYS WILL! just wish they made a 2nd one to this plus it works great on my razor phone sadly couldn't play it on my axon 7 due to the axon being a 6.1 software.",
        "FFS Rockstar, Works great with my Shield Tablet K1 but won't even install on my Shield TV 2015 because you guys marked it incompatible despite allowing it on the STV 2017? They're the exact same device? It works perfectly once side loaded as well. Please whitelist the Shield TV 2015 R*, Nvidia have confirmed its your issue so please fix it asap.",
        "When it comes down to mobile games, I could never really choose what games to download. The moment I saw this game on the Google Play Store, I lost my mind due to the fact that Bully is by far my favorite Rockstar Video Game! I've played it on Xbox and now on the Mobile addition and man, I got to say that Rockstar did an amazing job with the updated graphics! The game play is amazing as always and the controls are very easy to manage! The game never lagged out on me not once, and I've got to play it on my new Galaxy S8. I recommend this game if you're looking for a great story line and free roam experience. The map is decent in size and you get to beat people up all The time lol!"

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance",
        "It's a great game where you can race and customise your own car. However here are some ideas I would like you the imlament please  1. If the cars from the NASCAR can get the custmizeing like all the others.   2. To extend the custmize can yo add a tab where you can put spoilers, air intakes And other things you would put on a car.  3. Finally to make this game real racing 3 if when a race of just go to see all the car you have.  There be a \"i\" button that will give the player real information about the car the player is looking at."

        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "Good game but......after a day into it you make no coin. After every level upgrade it pushes the (buy) equipment option. Not to mention every time you level up. You got to.exit out 15 boxes.before you can continue. Good game but, it's a failure on the free to play aspect.  My rating is fair and final. It's a (ok)  game but many better ones out thwre",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",
        "Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s"

        "I find it a little tricky to navigate sometimes, since it makes my on-screen navigation bar disappear. I like it but maybe I would like it more if there was a back arrow? Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",
        "Really disappointed. I played the party game to win the St Patrick's badge. I came 2nd place when it finished and ift said I had won a badge but it doesn't appear in my badge collection. Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. 😟",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ❤👏👏",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player's data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player's stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player"

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",

I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",

        "Changing my rating....the game used to be awesome but has recently got a lot of bugs... constantly crashes, powers etc are not awarded as they should be. My 3 main characters were at Promotion 10 and XP level 50....one fine day, they get reduced to Promotion 7 and 25 XP. ...",
        "When you hard hit or strike the opponent gets twice the build up than you. Kinda pointless. Also when you block you take so much damage and or lose your specials. Wwe version of this does it best IMO. Now keeps force closing",
        "This game keeps freezing, and i keep losing my energy. My online account was suspened for unkown reasons, and I've been trying to get a hold of customer support for at least three months now, and they have yet to respond as to why my account was suspended.

For example I had 2 ascended points put them into damage reset it and got 20000 back. Gotta fix that. Over all it's a really fun game",

I'm about an hour into grinding and have only been forced to watch one 30 second ad but you have the option to watch a few more for items or perks. No bugs seen yet. I got a little happier when I left the game on and my lil hero's went into the dungeon without me.",
        "Can be very fun but is confusing at some points. For example, while attempting to ascend, you must lose the battle. Capturing beasts is also confusing and im still not sure what they are even used for. Otherwise, great game!",
        "This game gets very complicated very quickly. The game's mechanics of clicking on your character to heal them doesn't work often because the characters move quickly.  If you lock a specific item it still allows you to sell it with no notice. Overall a decent game that has too much to offer up too early.",
