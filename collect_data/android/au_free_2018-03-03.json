Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',

What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!',
       'This skill-based time waster would be better without the hyper-agressive advertising. First you have the constant banner ad at the bottom of the screen. That\'s forgiveable because it\'s out of the way and doesn\'t really affect gameplay. It\'s the fail-state adevertisements that constantly interrupt retrys that will irritate even the most casual of gamers.   The only people writing good reviews for this game are bot accounts.',
       'Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'The game was amazing! There was only 1 problem. Sometimes when i  started a game in the middle of it, it would just show an ad and it would make me lose. Unless you fix this my rating will be 4 stars. Fix this and the rate will be 5 stars' ],

     [ 'I have been playing for a while now, I like almost all of the game, not too impressed that "the piggy bank " is basically held to ransom until you buy it... find another way to entice spending... reduce number of coins won or something but as the levels get hard if you dont spend money you get stuck even with team helps.. it gets disheartening and reduces interest after a while.. to the gamemakers: keep the game playable..the money will come',
       'Update...as I go though the levels Ill get stuck for a day or two...even 3 on a level. Gameplay FUN has Dropped significantly. Moved to 3 stars as a result. If it does not change I\'ll continue to move to 1 star. Games are many to be played...not just stuck on a level forever!  Other issue with the game is that there\'s so much clicking and waiting once you win. I wish that it would just go right to the next level and it wouldn\'t have to wait for the splash screen. I just spend so much time wasted versus playing',

       'Don\'t waste your time playing this game.  I got too 300 + levels but you get 100 coins for completing each level.  Unfortunately it goes in a piggy bank, which you need to pay to break starting from £1.99, then next piggy bank was £4.99.  It\'s a con!',
       'It is now my favorite game. It\'s second only to toy blast. You have the best two games ever. I never get around to any of my other games I\'m stuck on these two.',
       'I really enjoyed it up until I got to like level 118. The only way I could figure out the pass that level was to use the things at the bottom of the screen or the things the page where you choose what you want to put in there in advance. But if you don\'t buy extra coins then you can\'t either had moves or get anything that will help you along. Not to mention that 100 coins per item is a lot of money. When you charge $2 450 coins. I\'m taking this game off my apps.' ],

Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'I enjoy the game greatly. It\'s slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I\'m not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game',

Bonus round go straight to the app store to see the ad you X\'ed out available for download. Go back and BAM try the X again YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACE.

       'It\'s so fun with all the different types of patterns.im telling you its the best game you will play in your life.When I die it\'s actually quite good, because the last time I did had 100 to spend and when I had passed the next 4 rounds I had 10,000 to spend so you should realy get this game,and Change your life people.Plus the new thing is the star block makes you invincible for a short amount of time for example I was going when I had 93 and I went in 24 star and I Could go through 100 and 123,000 for 1 minute. Anyway great game if you liked my review go onto Episode to see that review. Hope you love the game. Oh and I forgot to tell you a list of all the patterns we have purple, green,rainbow,pink,🍔,💵,🚗 and grey.',
       'It\'s a very fun game with so much to offer, the snake colors are very funny and colorful, but one thing I do not like is that there are SO many ads! When you simply try to restart a game it makes ANOTHER ad pop up for the 35 time. Please fix this issue.',
       'Nice concept, nice controls, the problem is that is too much randomnes and less skill. It forces me in corners where I\'m definitely dead or the good boxes are in corners where i can\'t go because of the walls and that also means im dead. Please make it less random or ar least make that if i comith to a path and because of the game i cant chage is, at least dont make the first mistake ista death.',
       'It\'s to many ads like beyond the amount I\'ve seen on any other app. You lose a life then there a 30 sec ad after every time you lose a life. When the ads over you jump right back into the game. Making it difficult to play because it doesn\'t give you enough time to make your next move. If they remove the ads may it would be a better game.' ],

It\'s starting to suck. I\'m thinking off deleting it, you can\'t expect us to pay for it when there\'s no free stuff like have something like a free tearsure box. Or something. You guys to improve your game before I rate it a 5 star again.',

I do not know where it came from but first 2 lines WERE not me as I have not committed until I same this false statement printed. I very much enjoy playing this game on my phone while watching television. Anyone have wide variety of choices so should be able to find something you enjoy, I pay several on the site.',

     [ 'This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn\'t at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you\'re playing as. Perfect game. 😁👍  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There\'s an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can\'t do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.',
       'I think it\'s incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.',
       'Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company\'s stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.',
       'I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you\'re done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.',
       'First of all, congratulations on the full release! I\'ve been playing this game for a few months now and I\'m absolutely hooked. Whenever I\'m bored or don\'t want to use my phone\'s data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading',
       'I love this game so much! Something I\'ve been doing is playing a life then playing out the children from the previous life. Since the game doesn\'t have a grandchild feature (yet?), it makes it really fun to create family trees. I do hope some more fantastic features are added in the future, but it\'s amazing as of now!  One thing I definitely want to see though, is the inclusion of an Asexual option when it\'s time to decide sexuality. I was slightly disappointed when I saw that the only options for attraction are opposite attraction, same attraction, or both bit no neither option.' ],

Make it more like the casino game before it was changed, single window main with four bonus screens, player claims all wins, OR, keep four main windows with higher minimum bet and have four window bonus screens but player MUST claim all wins.  I am level 48 and bought my way to platinum status. Higher level players ( larger bets) wouldn\'t mind buying coins regularly if it were more fun.',
       'Tighter than the real ones...  These are supposed to be entertaining.  The games are some of my very favorites in real life, but these aren\'t fun.

       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',

It\'s very frustrating to me because I have hit the targeted first Star and had recently hit ALL THREE Stars showing normally that I completed the Goal. No dice. I hope someone fixes this bug soon. It\'s making me not want to play anymore and I love playing this with my kids.',
       'I love this game. It\'s so good. HOWEVER, I paid for 50 gold bars and one of each extra(i.e. Pinwheel, lollipop, striped candy, etc...). After the payment went through, I only received 14 gold bars and NO extras. Please help. I have been stuck on level 348 for several weeks, because of that blasted bomb, and need the extras to help pass it. Do you have a hint on how to pass this level?',
       'If you like bejeweled Type puzzle games you will love this one. It\'s far more challenging with every level. Sometimes I wanna throw my iPad or phone at the wall...but I can\'t get enough of this game!',
       'Love this game so much.  Just that some of the games are too hard.  I got hung up on a game 226 or so for like over 2 years.  I stopped playing for a long time because I was so tired of that tough game.  But back to playing again.',
       'O jogo tem potencial pra ser ótimo e poderia se espelhar mais nos modos de Bejeweled. Mas chega a ser ridícula a forma como o nível dos estágios sobe aleatória e drasticamente, praticamente obrigando o usuário a gastar dinheiro pra passar. E é MUITO dinheiro: você compra um jogo AAA de PC pelo preço de uns dois Charm daqui.',
       'It is very challenging. When you get stuck on a level it takes a while for you to actually pass it.   You will be so relieved until the next level. It\'s even harder than the previous level. So. Good Luck. Have fun.' ],

     [ 'This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren\'t) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren\'t 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of "Relaxing". Thank you for your consideration.',
       'Good but £4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.' ],

Also, I like the items and clothing on the catalog, so that you can change your avatar - remember, you need to pay for the clothing with robux! If people call you noobs, don\'t listen to them. Just be yourself. There are some bullies of there: just stay away from them :D',
       'This app is great for five to ten year olds as it stops any personal info or any engagement. However, even though this game is made for all ages the filter can prevent lots of messages of such that not only are innocent, but friendly messages. I recommend this app for younger children under 10. Overall ok app.',

But Roblox mooched us with new lims. Anyways controls are meh but gameplay is strong. Also, anyone that says this is a copy of minecraft, this was made in 2006 so in a way minecraft copied roblox.',

     [ 'I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I\'ve purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I\'m really hooked on. Not to mention I\'ve put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I\'m limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It\'s just too expensive in the end.',
       'I love this app! I just wish you could collect more than 2 keys at a time. Sometimes the chapters feel short and to only be able to accumulate 2 keys feels like its not enough. 3 to 5 would be way better! Its already a bummer to not have enough diamonds to unlock cool stuff. (unless you want to pay more.. Not everyone has money to spend on phone app games)',
       'I actually really like this game. It\'s fun, it\'s time killing, all that good stuff. But the diamonds are what really kill it.  You get one free diamond at the end of every chapter, which would be nice if it didn\'t cost 25+ diamonds to make a choice. So to get all the options required to have a truly full game play experiance you must buy the diamonds, which also wouldn\'t be a problem if they didn\'t cost so much. (For 5 dollars you get 60 diamonds which is ruffly 2 choices and really they should be lasting longer then that.) There isn\'t even the option to watch an add for more diamonds. Buying them is the only choice if you want to have those certain experiances. I understand that the company has to make money, I really do, but charging out the ass for something is not the way to do it. In short, I would love this game if it didn\'t cost an arm and a leg to play.',
       'Addicting, but the makers are greedy. You have to spend money if you really want to play. Unrealistic cost of diamonds, you get one per chapter but it costs 30 diamond to get the dress or 25 diamonds to go with your friends. Give more options to get more faster. Illbwatch adds or rate things to get more diamonds.',
       'I love it the most exciting story lines. I need you to write one more book about  Love Hacks it just ended suddenly. I have to know what happened to everyone if some of the other couples got married, had kids. Is some characters just single forever. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS SERIES JUSTICE. I FEEL SO HEARTBROKEN.',
       'Everything\'s smooth. Except the keys and diamond. It took so long to get a single key and it would be better if the choices will only cost 1diamond since you only give us 1diamond each chapter. Please update and think about it. Read ur feedbacks we all say the same thing!!! Please' ],

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline.

       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3' ],

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I\'ll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC\'s (and MK\'s) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.',
       'As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz\' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game',
       'Love that tekken is on the phone I was a master at it when I was younger no one could beat me with my combos and counters. The game play is good but having to heal at every opportunity is not. The fight should be about the fight not having to heal before going into the fight. If I could go into every fight with full health I would probably spend money on upgrades and fighters . It\'s good but not brilliant as tekken should be. It yous would like to hear what I have to say message me back because I love and loved tekken on the PS and Xbox one of my top 3. Games off all times. Keep up the good work but yous are not just there yet for me to spend money on it but overall it\'s good but not brilliant as it should be',
       'I just download this game today and every time i open it  in 10 to 15 sec game just close automatically. I haven\'t even do the tutorial yet this game just dont even open i love Tekken 7 i play every time in ps4 but i hate android Tekken cant even open. I will hope they fix this game.i have seen the gameplay on youtube i will give this game 5 star but only if i can play the game so untill then i will give one star because thia game graphics were cool on video Thnks for the update it works grat now' ],

What I mean is you know when your finger is not sync with character movement (uhh how do I explain this). Sorry my english is terrible. Idk if you get what Im trying to explain. Like 0.5 second delay when look left look right look up look down. Its very hard to aim at enemy and looting and stuff. All of this happen after the Feb 28 update.',

     [ 'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃',
       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ],

Then they want tokens, which you must buy, to go further. The deals on weapons that are offered are always just out of reach. You can earn diamonds watching videos but I would rather play a game than waste time watching stupid add so I can play a game. It was fun but no more. Deleting.',

       'If you haven\'t played this game yet, don\'t bother downloading it. They will just ruin everything within a few weeks. The developers of this game are the biggest idiots I\'ve ever seen in these games. Almost every update is a downgrade. It had gotten to the point where only PvP was fun to play and then over the last 2 updates they have completely ruined it. I don\'t know why the hell these developers can not grasp the concept of "if it\'s good, leave it the hell alone." I am now very thankful that my paycheck was late because I was going to get the "premium plus" package to further upgrade my gear for PvP, but now that I\'ve seen the new update there\'s no way in hell  I\'m wasting the money. Thanks for another major disappointment developers, you guys truly are morons. But hey, at least you\'re consistent!',

After it happened for the sixth to seventh time, I started making a note of what words I tried. Not good, needs fixing ASAP. Luckily for me, I\'m not one to waste money buying coins.',
       'Should be able to spell words no matter how many letters are only recommend. Would\'ve had a lot more coins if that wasn\'t such a limiting factor. Definitions should be added after word is found in case user wants to know what he/she spelled. At least, I want to know what the definition is. That way, I am learning new words. Enhancing my vocabulary as what this app was created/designed for. Right? Right?',
       'Really enjoyed the game. Fun to play, keep coming back, sometimes letters are too close together and it is hard to select the ones you want without others getting in the way. The present doesn\'t ever give me above 39 coins. It\'s either rigged or I am very unlucky.',
       'A lot of fun and a challenge to your mind!  There were a lot of adds, but if you paid for some coins (at any price package you wanted) they went away.  After I did that my experience has been much more enjoyable!',
       'Fun and very challenging and addicting. I don\'t like all the ad\'s, but you get used to it. I haven\'t had to pay anything yet, hopefully won\'t have to. If it comes to that point then I will stop playing. So far so good!',

     [ 'I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON\'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn\'t take long it\'s a simple engine.',
       'I paid the price to get the ads removed, because I like to support developers and because there were a LOT of ads. The ads were never removed. I have contacted the developers more than once and received no response. Then I contacted the Play Store and they rejected my claim. Now I have paid for the ads to be removed and they are still there at a level that makes the game unplayable. Worst customer service ever; what a waste of money. I will remember this developer and never download another of their apps.',
       'Terrible game. I can\'t pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.',
       'EDIT TO PREVIOUS REVIEW: I PAYED FOR AD FREE AND REINSTALLED IT AND NO LONGER HAVE AD FREE!  I loved basically all of it except... If you don\'t buy ad free the game is completely unbearable with how many ads there are. Also I absolutely hate how it kicks me out of the challenges after I die if I tap too many times or I hold the screen while waiting for it to load.',
       'I liked the game at first, but got tired of ads and bugs. The gameplay is not smooth (using s7 edge). When losing a challenge  and want to retry, you have to be careful not to tap too much or you\'ll get sent to the main screen instead. It wanted permission for location and to make phone calls.',
       'This game looks great and plays well, BUT the ads are ridiculous. I hadn\'t paid attention to reviews since I had not intended to originally purchase anything, but just like many others I bought the Ad Removal and it did nothing. The ads are too frequent, too annoying, and worst of all unable to be removed even with purchase. I have reached out to Google about a refund.' ],

     [ 'What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn\'t be playing it if I couldn\'t play as Pac-Man, he\'s such a good inclusion. It\'s a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you\'re prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.',
       'Game looks good and it\'s well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m',
       'This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven\'t tried it. It\'s occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!',
       'This is a pretty cool sonic game for moblie for 1 it\'s cool for 2 you can unlock other sonic Characters and for 3 other characters from other games will come too like Mrs. Pac man!',
       'I love the new updated keep up the good work and thank you for making us vs people online this the way to earn more rings and red stars rings',
       'This is a good game with a decent progression system. The ads are a bit much sometime but my son and I can play and have fun everytime.' ],

The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??',

     [ 'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'I can\'t do normal Sudoku as it\'s too hard. I really like this though, where I can change numbers easily & get hints. I like the highlighted errors. In time I might switch off this function & not use the hints, but it is helping me at the moment to get better... The game still requires a lot of thought. I\'ve been a bit hooked...',
       'Great game for keeping your mind active and gives me something to do on my phone.  If there was a way to get rid of the adds then it would be even better.  I wouldn\'t expect a free game to be advert free; but I would like a feature to remove them even if I have to pay.',
       'It\'s great love the daily challenges. Placing the numbers isn\'t intuitive for me, I like to select the number I want to work on then place it down so I often overwrite my number when I accidently attempt this. Even still its honestly the best sudoku app that I\'ve used',
       'I\'m a total noob at Sudoku, but I love all the settings you can turn on and off, like making notes so you can brainstorm multiple numbers that could fit in a given box or the highlight a row/column/box or the feature that will show conflicting numbers in red. Definitely helping me learn the ropes.',

     [ 'Lots of fun and challenging trying to find the best placement for a word to maximize your score.   The one objection I have relates to the dictionary.  When checking a word\'s meaning in the dictionary that any opponent played, and I don\'t recognize,  the dictionary will sometimes say that it is an acceptable word for Words with Friends, but no definition is available at this time.  I believe that when playing a game having to do with vocabulary, no word that does not have a dictionary definition should be allowed!  What determines if it is a legitimate  word if not found in a dictionary?',
       'Have been playing for years and the enhancements keep improving it. This is not Scrabble. It\'s a different game wth its own features. Use those features and enjoy. It\'s hard enough to earn coins to make use of the features a rarity rather than the norm. And Word Strength (always available) is great - you can just accept your lower value word or challenge yourself to work even harder to find a better one. It\'s a great game - especially as once you\'ve had a go, you can leave it for hours (or days!) and only play when you have time. 😊',
       'Good gameplay. I enjoy playing this game. Great for expanding vocabulary. However, too many words that are acceptable without definitions. Should be a way to submit definitions for words, or maybe link with a dictionary app. Additionally, what\'s with the ads after every move? I end up closing game and restarting, it\'s quicker than watching the ads. If they where shorter, I would let them play.',
       'Good game. Only problem there are games that left for 16 + days and you can\'t get rid of them. Even when you nudge the person ... nothing happens. This impacts on starting new games with those who want to play! Please sort this out. Ads too long in version 2. Would rate better if this was sorted.',
       'I\'m no longer getting my bonus points playing the challenger of the day.  I\'m owed hundreds of coins. Also, there is a lot if different words that are playable and unplayable versus the original sctabble board game. There are several editions of scrabble dictionaries that you could update with. Other then that this is a pretty entertaining game.',
       'I really enjoy playing with my friends, just another way to keep in touch even though you\'re miles away! You can also meet and play new folks, as well as play all of the various challenges the game has to offer while you are playing. For example, you earn coins for different words played, difficulty of words played, or words with certain letters. If you enjoy just playing to play or playing for a challenge, this game has it all!' ],

     [ 'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment \'\'Wow, update, ok\'\'. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they\'ve done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can\'t just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg.' ],

I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',

However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',

I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',

I wouldn\'t always add that footstool or bench.  It is also difficult to play without spending money and I cannot afford to do that.  Keys are required to decorate properly (plants, decor) and can take a long time to accumulate.  This is my favourite game though and I will continue to play and patiently wait just do my best with what I have.  I do watch the videos to gain more keys but woe is me...',
       'Great game! Love it! Only voting system is not accurate. I think  designs that not reflecting the theme should not get  5 stars. It would be nice to have experts inside the game who will review designs for THEME and reward those who follow the theme and get great result  in designing. I suggest to  give one point for those who is following theme, and get one point out if someone not. Fairness is important.',

     [ 'I used to play this game a couple years ago, and at the time, it had satisfying gameplay and great time killing qualities. I used to love it then and I still do now, but I\'ve recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that\'s driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn\'t allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I\'m not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.',
       'Marvelous game!!! Likely you back to the right on your last update.  I just purchased the chainsaw blade, the DRAGON blade was a huge desappointment we was expecting phenomenal motions not that catoon flag . Also : all the good stuff are in mini game, the others dojos are kind very less quality, let us use minigame blades and dojos in arcade or zen even by purchase that will be nice. Thank you',

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I\'m on the second restaurant and I\'m bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can\'t upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....' ],

     [ 'I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I\'m not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain\'t getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!!

     [ 'Sooooooo addicting ,I love this game so fun,  relaxing and has great music. I can\'t stop playing. So awesome,they should make more word searches or word crosses like these kind of games. All though  you have to pay for some parts of the game but out of all the games I have ever played this on is #1😍😂😃',
       'I love this game! It\'s a real challenge and better than the normal ones because of the backgrounds and how it\'s a crossword. You could add an online player vs player thing too. I love the daily challenges. Maybe add something to win instead of coins? If you love a good daily challenge defiantly get the game!! 😊',
       'Game itself is good but to have an advert appear everytime you get to the next level is a bit much. It\'s always the same adverts and it\'s not easy to close the advert. It directs you to playstore to install the app that is being advertised.  I know you need to make money for making this app but the ads are spoiling what was once nice to play. I use it less and less each time I see an ad.',
       'The only bad thing about this game is the sheer volume of ads. I understand it\'s to push you to spend money but it\'s more likely to stop me playing. Tone them back a little and it\'ll make for a much more enjoyable experience that I would be happy to recommend to friends. Ads are a fair trade off for a free game, but not at this current frequency.',
       'Fabulous word game. The whole family is addicted. Could do with a slightly wider vocabulary in that sometimes you find a perfectly good word that is not in the grid but it\'s not allowed in the bonus bank. But that\'s just being picky. Overall, well, well worth the modest price to go ad-free. Highly recommended.',
       'Got me hooked way too easily, then got so many people I know playing it too. The simplicity is what makes it work and the irritation of finding a word you (should) know makes me keep playing, over and over and over.  One of the best games I have played in ages!' ],

     [ 'With an easy guide, on \'How to play\'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an \'A☆\' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.',
       'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!' ],

       'Cant sync with facebook gameroom so all money spent on there and had to start again when tablet was fixed and wanted to move back.

Once you get so far along in the game, plan on forking out $$$. On some levels you\'ll need 2 or 3 boosters and extra moves to beat one level to win one star. They will use all kinds of tricks to get you to spend more and more money.',

I do not need a reminder when I have lost a level that I can spend coins to continue. I used to be able to at least disable that reminder for the fireworks show but now it reminds me for the magic hat, the competitions, basically everything. Please remove this "feature". Trust me that I am QUITE aware of what I lose when I can\'t complete a level.',

The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',

     [ 'Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you\'ll be amazed.',
       'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.' ],

It is nice and easy so any age group could play it. I just got it 3 days ago and so far it is fun. This is one of the games I have had in a long time that was actually really fun, and addictive. I suggest you get this game because it could be your favorite game. I hope if you do get the game you have a wonderful, fun filled time.       😄🏀🎖 Have a great time and get the game!

I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁',
       'I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it\'s so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You\'re clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I\'m only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.',
       'This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous"Candy Crush" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can\'t seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can\'t stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.',
       'Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'So when I first downloaded it I thought it was going to be really good and following to the comments, it is also addictive. The only issue is, it laggs when you get further up the tower. Please fix this issue and if you do, five stars from me! :)' ],

     [ 'The 30 host cap immediately becomes pretty difficult to work around, especially when you need to have duplicates of the  hosts to increase their max level cap/attribute score as well as duplicates of hosts for hat colours. I\'m hoping there\'s a way to increase this later in the game. Also, synthblood is incredibly difficult to obtain especially when you need more to fix higher level hosts. Overall though, the game is pretty generous with currency, so I don\'t think I\'ve ever ran into a hard building wall that made me think I had to spend money on it to progress further. So far, I\'m enjoying the game and looking forward to the updates',
       'The host cap of just 30 is a real problem because it becomes difficult to rank up higher level hosts. I would love to continue playing but the cap is a dealbreaker. Hope you can fix this asap',
       'I\'m very happy to have stumbled upon this game to satiate my cravings while I wait for season 2. I am enjoying this game so far. It keeps me hooked at a comfortable distance, not demanding. I love the quirky animations, the charming stylized set and character designs. My only qualm about the gameplay is the waiting time in Diagnostics. I thought spending 40gems for an additional host slot would mean two hosts being diagnosed at the same time. Instead I find out the 40gems was for the que. Also I\'m confused about the Escalante Technician daily task. I have completed the test in the church and yet the system is not rewarding me for it. Is there a particular test in Escalante that I have to do? Anyway great job to the game devs!',
       'Pros: 1. Good design and SFX 2. Balanced currency and gameplay 3. Detailed and reasonably complex  Cons: 1. Unnecessary level cap (level 25). I noticed that after reaching level 25, no additional exp is received for doing stuff.  I hope this level cap is removed, as there are still Escalante missions that require level 30, 35,..., 50 to take part in.  I feel like I am wasting my time and effort by catering on hosts when my supposed XP for those actions are neglected simply because the limit is at level 25 right now, when it should be at 50.  Please fix this, I really like playing this game. But because of this premature level capping, I\'m afraid this would significantly lessen my motivation in playing and spending on the game. Thanks.',

     [ 'This continues to improve.The original variety was fun, but each new game just seems to get better.  The graphics were always good, but the new ones are truly impressive, and fun.  The way they are combining multiple features of earlier games offers more play options and payoffs.  Almost impossible to put down. Bad luck suddenly reverses and is FUN!  Mini games add surprising excitement.',
       'I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I\'m already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I\'m already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..',
       'It is obvious this game is set to minimal wins. And if by chance there is a big win there wont be another win and you will lose ALL your winnings. It is also obvious the bonus wheel is set for minimum payout and if you do hit the big one the wheel will either suddenly stop b4 or regain momentum to move to the next amount. Such a cheat!!!!! Money hungry cheating tightwads',
       'At one time this is my ultimate favorite app.   Today I just took my five stars away and gave you two. You\'ve turned out to be a very very expensive game. The only way a person is able to win is if they purchased of coins from you it\'s not very cool or very fun.   And with a heavy heart I had make it two stars. Such a bummer cuz I really enjoyed this app at one time.',
       'I have played this game for a very, very long time.  I even have my husband playing.  We have fun competing against each other!  My coins go up and down.   Lately it has been down.  I have purchased additional coins on several different occasions.   I wish I could say it benefitted me.   Unfortunately they went quickly.  Without any wins to show for it.    As I said, I truly enjoy the games and will continue to play.  It depends on the app,  as to how long I will play at  time.   Keep up the great work!',
       'I\'ve been playing House of Fun every day for more than 6 months now and I haven\' t been bored once. The graphics are amazing and being able to stop the reels when you want to is a big plus over other apps of this type. New games are introduced regularly so there is never a worry that you\'ll grow bored with the same old lineup.' ],

       'Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that\'s just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now.

With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'I love this game! Been just playing on my wife\'s account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won\'t even register me moving. I\'ve tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what\'s going on?',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'Can you developers make it so people can trade pokemon and other things like items? Itll make the game sooooo much better if teamates could trade items and Pokemon. People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4.' ],

     [ 'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!

       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',

Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       'Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!',
       'DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don\'t think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT',

     [ 'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there\'s nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.',
       'A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'It gives me something to do on my off time and. As I play I start to get very addicted to the point that I\'m fully in the game and I really love playing this game. I at least play up to 30 to 40 minutes a day just because how intense it is. Keep up the good work!!! 👍',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.' ],

When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they\'re not.',

     [ 'Fun, graphics are nice. Free money goes quickly and some of the games bonuses and free spins some have decent ones but infrequent.. They want you to spend real money like most online slots but if you don\'t play for a couple days and just collect the daily free coins you can play for a little while every few days. Unfortunately there isn\'t a lot of opportunity to get free coins. The wins don\'t out weigh the losses but that is usually like it is in real casinos so  at least you don\'t lose real money :) If your patient and don\'t continue to buy the "sale" packages but rather build up the free daily spins.  I just play other slot games  until the free coins build up a little on this one so I can play for awhile. I do like the game though, lots of game choices .',
       'Agree with other reviews...all they want is you to BUY BUY BUY!! I won $14 BILLION on a jackpot...that\'s HUGE! And yet, no matter what I played, tried small and large bets, I LOST EVERYTHING in a matter of hours!!! That\'s how ridiculous it is! Also contacted support about a glitch and they NEVER fixed it...it just rips you off on free games. Great games...just a total waste of time.',
       'I was playing a tournament u have going for Valentine\'s day. I get to a game where I have 65 million and I won over the 20 million that was a quest. I lost over 100 million trying to get a free game quest. If I want this kind of feeling I can go to a real casino and drop real money there and get the same result.',
       'The Most "Indecent"Slot apps  on Google Play. Non stop popup ads..Spin once..lose 60%  Close 3 popups. Spin, win 10% Close 3-4 popups. Contact them? Sure..If you want to give them your Paypal login info..Stay away',
       'What a waste of time, had free spins twice but i  all the time never once did I get 6 HEARTS. HOW MEAN CAN YOU BE.If you buy coi s good luck all they want you to do is BUY BUY BUY. Once again why did I bother.  THIS IS THE WORST SITE EVER',

     [ 'I think this is an exceptionally well made game. This truly is a great golf game. Here\'s where it falls flat... I feel as if you must spend money in order to receive all the benefits that the game had to offer.  If you have 8Ball pool, then this will make sense to you. You can still curve your shot, even if you don\'t pay for anything in the game. In this game, however, you cannot adjust the curve at all when you use the basic ball. I feel as if it is closer to "Pay to Win" than other games of similar nature.',
       'Best game period. Not just golf or sports game, but any game. Wouldn\'t change a thing. All ya all who say, oh they need to change this or that, and why do I have to play someone who\'s better than me? Well it\'s because you suck, and you have no hand eye coordination. Just shut up and dribb, uh I mean play. #1 game for a reason peeps. Love ya. Dueces. Peace biatches.',
       'Game is based on luck. Could be so much better if it was more realistic ie club selection. How can it be fair when it is easier to chip in from off the green than it is to hole a putt? NEED TO FIX BUG THAT MAKES MY SHOT HAPPEN WITHOUT MY FINGER LEAVING TABLET SCREEN!!! HAS COST ME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COINS!!! When are you going to fix this issue??? If this was my game I would be extremely embarrassed with all the fault\'s',
       'This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it\'s pretty awesome!',
       'Stop changing the winf its getting boring now !!  I mastered the wind only for ypu to make it not work in in some games or even make the wind twice as strong as the value stated. You should be matched on games played not trophies. Otherwise the good players who go up the trophies quickly always play people with better clubs. The game goes easy on you if you\'re not good at it which defeats the point of getting good',
       'This game is really starting to piss me off.  Main issue I\'m having is the stupid game freezing and telling me it\'s trying to reconnect in the middle of a game.  I\'ll make a shot then it will continue to count me down and tell me I\'m out of time.  Freezes until my times up. I\'ve lost close to 200k in coins lately and it\'s really starting to piss me off. Also, never consistent. I\'ll make a near identical shot as my opponent and ball travels completely different. Really starting to piss me off. Been playing this game for a LONG time and I\'m about ready to delete it!' ],

     [ 'My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I\'ve got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, "mass" and magnetism... But it\'s really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can\'t... Because your "pencil" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don\'t get in your way as much as this one.',
       'It\'s an alrite game. Some people like this kind of puzzle, but I am not too fond of it. Being a freeware it has ads that can pop up before and after each puzzle... so prepared to be annoyed. Game has many solutions and offers hints(not before... you guessed it, watching an ad first) so you can atleast get through some of the harder levels. I\'d say give this game a try until you get frustrated by the app, not because of hard puzzles but because of ads.',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜' ],

I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',

Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',

     [ 'Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I\'ve ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it\'s addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don\'t forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals',
       'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.',
       'I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that\'s what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.',
       'Everyone I know plays Cookie Clicker (CC), definitely too much. I absolutely refuse to play Cookie Clicker myself. I am not one to compete over single-player games, so I was looking for something similar, a game that none of my friends play. AdVenture Capitalist (AVC) fit the profile and is a simplified version of CC. I\'m not saying that AVC is more rewarding than CC, but it isn\'t nearly as convoluted. It\'s a simple game for those of us who want to minimize our time spent on phone games.',
       'I really like this game. its really fun. so i figured  i should tell you that all you have to do is change your date and time and the game doesn\'t know. Like i change it to the year 2036 and i get all of those years of profit in secs and then my phone fixes the date its self and i can do it again. I\'ve restarted twice cause i felt bad for cheating lol. Well hope you can make it were we can\'t do that anymore.' ],

     [ 'The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn\'t receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.',
       'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There\'s no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!',
       'its frustrating on the pvp. you get disconnected and automatically lose. and sometimes they put you against someone who has better ships and level. they need to make it even and offer each player the same ships and same power ups at the same time. sometimes I get no power ups until round 3 and my opponent is already on level 7 because he gets better ships and power ups.' ],

Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message "go online for more episodes" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'U want 5***\'s, well hard is ridiculously too hard, it has impossible levels that  you only win,  when king wants you to, this is so utterly ridiculous! Really makes me want to uninstall the game. I will give it another try, I\'m waiting for the game to divvy out more tries.. I mean 35 tries is stingy for a hard level, how about 45 tries instead?',
       'I\'m a addict when it comes to all the candy crushes I\'m currently on level 1060 (a really hard level) and I\'m  upset cause I get almost threw with that level and the app just close very upset fix the glitch please.. Other then that like I love candy crush but it still get 4 stars!',
       'I love this game but after the latest update I lost things. I had logged in 150 days in a row and loved getting the bonuses each day. Today I logged in and it put me back to day 1!!! I know I logged in yesterday and didn\'t miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you\'ve earned.',

I hate to Uninstall being I\'m at level 727 & Hitting the (X) does nothing but frustrates me & I\'m just about to delete. 😠 Please change some how some way.',
       'One of my favorite games, but after the most recent update, just like most of the reviews in the last several days, I\'m stuck at 705. I should be at 1153. Tells me to go online and download new episodes when I\'m constantly online. Need to patch it or rework the coding.   Edit: finally fixed, everything is running smoothly. Thanks!' ],

     [ 'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game' ],

     [ 'Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It\'s not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please',
       'Love this game! The only part I don\'t like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won\'t buy any diamonds. I\'ll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.',
       'I like the game but waiting three hours for two passes is terrible.  And we have no other option to get free passes it is either wait or pay. I feel like I\'d we got more than two passes I would be okay with the wait. But waiting three hours knowing I am going to use those two tickets in less than a half hour is crazy.  Then I will lose interest in the story and forget what had happen, it isn\'t okay. But other than the wait for passes I really like this game.',
       'I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don\'t mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don\'t have then you should find a different app.',
       'Great app, just too many of the same type "romance" stories over and over again. It feels like only one person is writing stories on here, when It claims to have over 55,000 different stories. Each time i try to search for a new book to read a new, the same twelve pop up over and over. Fix that please. I very much enjoy supporting community made books but it seems like it\'s just a popularity contest on here, with the same story line and plots being used far too much.',
       'I love the idea of this game. But think it\'s absolutely stupid that everything costs so much gems and it ruins the whole game. You can pick any food choice bc you need 20 if not more gems and it happens so often. Would not reccomd this game TO ANYONE' ],

       'The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn\'t the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It\'s just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone',
       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',
       'Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase',
       'I had to update it so I did and when I wanted to play after that, it says "watch video to get extra seed slot" WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR WITH THE COINS I COLLECTED ALL THESE TIMES. Even before the update, it has so many ads but this is much worse. Definitely not happy with the update.',
       'It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable' ],

     [ 'I love this game, i\'ve been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can\'t see or control what I\'m doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.',
       'Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it\'s trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.',
       'Very addictive game.  Next version here are some thoughts:  show some flames on re-entry.  Docking clamps so you can put fuel into orbit and pickup additional fuel so you can go to Venus and return to earth.  Put the rest of the planet\'s in there.  Make it so you can take cargo such as rocket parts to moons and other so you can build a rocket there that can go further due to low gravity at launch.  I really liked this game and a lot could be done with it.',
       'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.' ],

     [ 'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'The stories are addicting and exciting. But you make us watch several ads and THEN ask us to pay for EVERY THING extra. From clothes to hair to what to say next to new chapters. I get the world revolves around money but you are getting paid plenty with these big name ads. Let the game be more enjoyable and make it free or a set price from the start for the app. You lure people in and then ask for money if they want to continue. Nah, I\'ll wait an hour for the ticket. Great game concept though.',
       'I\'ve only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn\'t bad. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You\'re able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! However, at the moment, it isn\'t working for me. No matter how many times I try to speed up the clock, it isn\'t budging. It was working 2 hrs ago. So, IDK if there is a daily limit or what, because I didn\'t get a warning. There is something about the videos I don\'t like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!',
       'I pay for the unlimited ticket and never got what I paid for. Customer service has been unhelpful. I have emailed them many times and have gotten nothing but surveys back. My issue has not been taken care of.',
       'I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I\'ve used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I\'ve recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The \'free\' diamonds doesn\'t work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn\'t pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn\'t anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these....',
       'So addictive I couldn\'t stop playing it. Only thing I will say is you need to get to many diamonds for the clothes and some of the decisions you have to make. X Is there any more books after Mona series study abroad ? As it did say to be continued' ],

I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',

     [ 'Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.',
       'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',

So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'It\'s been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there\'s no rhythm at all. Why don\'t you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it\'s only getting worse..',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.' ],

     [ 'Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',
       'I urge people to stay as far away as possible from this 1! They are robbing lying cheating scumbags, using illegal and and fraudulent tactics to get money from your bank account in to theirs! Such as offering deals and then not giving you what you have paid for! Investigation underway!',
       'This is an interesting game. It doesn\'t give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn\'t give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it\'s just okay. I\'ve never been able to get anywhere with their support team as the add to my reply. I\'d give it a one star but I like playing with what they give me free.',
       'I have played this game for many months I have purchased and yet with all the updates you all do it keeps getting worse the payouts on the slots are horrible. The group event games are picked I think to take all our chips so we will be forced to buy I believe that until you make the payouts on the slots better you are going to lose a lot of customers.',
       'Considering the game is called BILLIONAIRE CASINO, the payouts are too little to support the name.  In the first couple of weeks on starting with the game payouts are great then like all other games you are on a continuous loss to PURCHASE COINS. Happy gaming.',
       'I\'m only writing a one star in hopes to get a response, and I\'m completely willing to go 5 stars. It\'s just every time I open the app, the only screen I see is telling me something is wrong and to submit a report. I\'m on a Google pixel' ],

     [ 'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.',
       'One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It\'s interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that\'s there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate' ],

       'Nice game very addicting only thing I would change is the amount of prey that can hurt you eagles shouldn\'t be able to hurt a medium sized dragon and also bows shouldn\'t be able to hurt M to XL dragons and the bite radius it sometimes doesn\'t work. I tried eating a M dragon and my combo time runs out because I can\'t bite him for no reason even when boosting kindly fix that co\'z even with the pet its still happening but all in all great game except for those minor things.',

     [ 'Hey supercell,no doubt your game is awesome but I didn\'t like the supercell id technique in the new update...why did u removed the Google play login system? It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.',
       'It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀' ],

About the ads: I have premium, and I only have to watch an ad if I choose to get a reward in return. There are no sudde, unwanted or random ads anymore.',
       'Simple game. Ads galore. Also when ads pop up better not be listening to music because it\'s gonna pause your music even if the ad has 0 sound. Thus the one star rating. You can advertise all you want but don\'t interrupt any background apps to force me to look at your ad. That\'s just messed up.',

It\'s just another stupid boring merger game like the thousands before it. On a fun scale of 1 to 10, this game is a 0 for all the ads and unoriginality. It was a free game, but I want my money and time and intelligence back.',

I mean for f@$k sake every two seconds there\'s an ad. Click on the car buying button there\'s an ad. Sit there to long there\'s an ad. I understand this is how you make your money but come on there\'s a line and you didn\'t just cross it you swan dived over that bad boy. I\'m sorry but I do not recommended this game for anyone.',

Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.',
       'Far too many ads. And being forced to watch a 30 sec ad before continuing! Sorry, uninstalling. Try banner ads only, and I will play this game for ages.

     [ 'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'The game isn\'t bad if you like word puzzles. My dislike comes from the fact that I have push notifications for this app turned off, but it somehow continues to manage to send them. It also keeps poor track of your coins. Good time killer.',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'This is one of the best word games I have ever, when running into a really tough spot not immediately uninstalled. This is a GREAT AND CHALLENGING GAME!!! It really makes you think and it keeps your brain thinking and actively. I love it and will keep it. I am 70 yrs old and just got this game a couple weeks ago and at almost level 300.. This is a keeper!!' ],

If you play this game,DO NOT SPEND MONEY TO BUY SPINS. People can steal your earnings... so you basically pay actual money, to give others coins...',

Please help and put me back to the level ahead of me as this is very upsetting for spending money and being right back where I was before. Fix it and I\'ll give it 5 stars for everything thank you',

     [ 'I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you\'ll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.',
       'I love this game, today i jus download the game, cause my friend ask me tooo download this game and he also said it was fun! So I download it, and he was correct, this game is fun, I just become level 4! Not so soon I will become level 5! Yay for me😁 And I already bought the 1500 Diamond suit! It is so expensive!😲 but I just want to show  I am not a noob and I like to show at people who dosen\'t heve it, lol😂 and also I loved the game very much, so thank you for making this game and shout out to my friend Imbran! And bye😁',
       'The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It\'s intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it\'s voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.',
       'It\'s a pretty solid effort at a battle royale genre it need more customization however maybe another map and just a tad smoother on the game mechanics. Also if it could hit the 100 player per match marker that would be great but I understand that the map must be smaller so it might get a little too crowded.',
       'I love this game so much, but what about more structures? Also I wish there was a chat in game that you can just type instead of voice chat, also the number one thing I wish you guys could add in or fix is the snipers bc they are weak... also I think there should be a counter somewhere when people dismount the plane so we can Dee how much are still in plane and how much already left  That\'s all',
       'good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members\'re 20 players. sorry for my bad english' ],

Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you\'re still coasting or you\'re in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You\'ve had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven\'t fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT\'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!',

     [ 'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones' ],

If that was not bad enough, the entities get stuck when the blade goes through them (mostly when the goblin guy spawns). Im going to keep the game installed in the hopes that these bugs will be ironed out soon. I love the idea this game presents, but I literally can\'t play it because i cannot progress through the beginning of the game due to these bugs. I reinstalled the game, but the issues still persisted. Please fix so i can enjoy your game. Thank you.',

     [ 'Slotomania is hands down the best fb has to offer.  The tournaments are some of the most challenging I have played.  They appreciate fans and the time they spend here.  The developer\'s must be building their apps with personal touches.  I get the sense of one on one attention during play and think to myself...No it\'s an app silly!  Of course it shows best in the generous bonuses and free chips.  This game is BIG fun.  I am sure Slotomania will continue to thrill all who play here!!',
       'Don\'t know how you ever going to collect all the sloto cards cause they don\'t come out. Free spins on the ace game I virtually non existent just about ready to remove the app',
       'It has great pay outs but the only negative thing is it takes all your winnings plus some for instance I had over 300 billion coins and I\'m down to 500000 haven\'t won since',
       'It\'s addictive but it\'s to hard to win money you have to keep buying it BECOUSE you lose it all in your spins. It\'s fun playing but it\'s hard when you lose it all rite away.',

     [ 'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something' ],

     [ 'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'A lot of Numberlink programs have "fake" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard "rules" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn\'t do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I\'ve been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.',
       'Edit: New horrible LOUD advertising you can\'t stop. Very disturbing to others and prevents usage around others.   Great puzzle games, lots of levels from easy to very hard. However it will eat your battery like there is no tomorrow. If your phone is plugged in, it will overheat. Use for more than about 15 minutes and your phone will burn your hand and shut down.' ],

After you collect everything, there\'s nothing else you can do, I believe there are many ideas that Voodoo can implement.',

You cannot have more than 2.15 billion points to spend at a time but you can earn as many points as you would like, but you still don\'t have more than 2.15 billion points to spend. This game is still very addictive, I am level 1,000 for shooter speed and level 600 for shooting power.',

       'The gameplay is pretty good. Although it doesn\'t feel like you\'re .aking any progress because the game will just keep getting harder. The reason why i rated it 1 star, is because of the ads. There is an ad every single tome after you die. I just couldnt take the ads',

Other then that game has potential.  Update 2: after installing the game again, it finally worked. But now I\'m uninstalling the game for good.

     [ 'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Really really addicted. Yes you know when your good. Yes you do.  Ok honest? Expand on the shop.  Tweaking the appearance and performance of the rides.  Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that\'s how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.' ],

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!',
       'Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can\'t load the game after update clear data and dl again',

     [ 'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool.' ],

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'You can earn a Max amount of 7 chalices at one time, and it takes a long time to re-accumulate chalices (some levels require the max amount of chalices in order to play level), and do not like the timed levels at all. I am on one now, and don\'t even want to play it, as I have run out of time, and it uses chalices up each time I play, and lose. Please remove these, liked the game a lot more before the timed levels were added. Otherwise, love the game.',
       'Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.',
       '2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove "pay to open" boxes or they don\'t go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low.' ],

     [ 'The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !',
       'Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.' ],

Pretty good app. Challenges are obviously based on bankroll making it more of a player\'s game instead of a winner\'s game because poker is not a winner\'s game. Long play on shootout can be annoying but why you buying in at 2k? You get to play daily if you like to play for free and can even complete challenges when you went bust.',

If you contact support they just send out a form email stating that "Help is on the way..." but they will not fix the issue of bots. They deny that bots are exploiting their app but when told of evidence, they send a form letter denying the existence of bots. They still have not stopped the bots from ruining the fun of trying to advance to higher leagues because they allow bots to exist on their app.',

     [ 'Ha! What a joke! You win absolutely nothing. Forget about seeing free spins once that becomes the mission. Just lost over 25 million and never got free spins once because it was mission. What a joke!!  Do NOT bet max bet apparently because it is just dead spin after dead spin, losing over 25 million in a minute proved that!! You win absolutely nothing at max bet!! I will not be keeping this game!!! Update, tried the game again, and yeah it is still horrible!! I won\'t give it another chance after this!!',
       'It is a well visual game.  The problem is it takes a really long time to move on to the next level.  The "xp" is too low, and I have to spend a really long time on one level to go on to the next.  I can\'t rate higher because I want to see the other slots but it\'s too long to reach them.',
       'Very addictive and keeps you guessing, which is one of the features I like the most. Great graphics and cute comments during turns. Also very intuitive, so no slow learning curve. Keep up the good work! I\'ve been a fan of Nat Geo for a very long time.',
       'game has no balance to it, some slots are too easy to win on and some the wins are few and far between. anyone else notice their responds don\'t make much sense or relate to the users comments? uninstalled now due to lack of customer support/services',
       'The problem with this slot game is you can never get a head. Day after day I have to wait for the daily bonus. They want you to spend money plain and simple.',

The little robot guy is a cutie, and keeps me going with his encouraging smile each time I finish a crossword.  The only problem I have, is that I don\'t always get my free tokens each day, even if it\'s been 24 hours since my last play.  Don\'t care for the amount of ads, but all in all a really great game.',
       'I can\'t stop playing it every spare moment I have available. Absolutely addicting.  Great time waster, but it also helps keep your mind sharp and it might even teach me a few new words too.  Great work!!!',
       'This game is INSANELY addicting! Cures my boredom while also challenging my brain in a way. Everyone I am around enjoys getting in on the game as well! I don\'t think it is too hard with the available hints, and it is definitely not so easy that you are tired of it instantly. Obsessed with this app! Recommended for sure!',
       'I have become addicted to this game! My only suggestion is maybe the creators could update it, so we can earn hint tokens after the player completes each five puzzle set.',
       'It would definitely be 5 stars if the game had a little change. Some people are not the best spellers? If there is an 8/9 letter word for Eg needed would it be possible to leave in the correct letters and highlight the letters that are wrong. Instead of deleting All the letters. You do help by autofiling other letters when a word is completed. Cheers',
       'Just went to play Cody Cross and it has gone from game 120 back to the very start after weeks of playing. Am now going to delete. What a waste of time if you do not get the chance to complete it then what is the point. Very disappointed as this was a good game until someone decided to shaft everyone.' ],

     [ 'I like the game, and it\'s addictive, but the mechanics are absolutely flawed. There have been tons of instances where the game has unfairly screwed me or other player\'s over. 1. Places mystery boxes in front of the player who drives second, but not the first player. 2. Hills like to stop a ball, that is being shot full force by an iron club, in it\'s tracks. 3. The swinging spike balls only affect some players golf balls, but not others.  Things like this piss people off, because they expect the game to be fair. Those small things easily aid a player in losing a match.',
       'Game cheats, puts you against lower lol players with better equipment who make ungodly shots, or much higher level where you don\'t have a chance. I hit things that aren\'t there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.',
       'The game doesnt allow you to get a proper pull back on your swing. To much clutter on some stages. Plus those who play too win always beat those who dont',
       'Uhm... Playing cod pissed me off so much because of the hacking I stopped playing. Same goes for this game..good luck to all that want to play and get ripped off. F U .',
       'Where to begin with this garbage game. The game designers aren\'t sure whether gems or strokes should win the hole. Oh..out of bounds shots don\'t incur penalties, which is idiotic. Also, pairings vary wildly in an unfair manner. You could have someone with 500 more exp. than you..hardly fair. Also, the opponent might have a tail wind of 4mph, but your shot moments later has a headwind. Again, poor conception and unfair. Just avoid this game. The inconsistency is bewildering and having an opponent win the hole even though they hit out of bounds is stupid.',

     [ 'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I\'m always playing this game whenever I\'m bored or if I have a time. When I\'m playing, it consumes 20 energy in every crime scene. I mean its unfair, how about the daily player of this game? Just consume 10 energy in every play please? I don\'t think this review won\'t pick your attention. And what I don\'t like the most is you need a report before proceeding to the next crime scene, it\'s a waste of time. Don\'t worry, I still love this game',
       'Update.  Trying to play again and remember why I uninstalled it.  You have to wait 40 minutes for enough energy to play 20 seconds.  Or, pay outrageous prices for a few minutes of play.  I like the game enough, i would pay a reasonable and higher  one time fee to get rid of ads, and have unlimited play.  I may uninstall, again. Uninstalling.  Like the game but hate waiting hours to play.  Now it\'s crashing',
       'Your usual find hidden objects game, and wait ages or pay to reveal the story fast model. Nothing new here. Tapping on things can be inaccurate as well. Tutorial story was lame. Mini games were totally unchallenging as well, yet we need to earn the right to play them.',
       'It\'s a great game. The only issues are:  1. It takes too long to feed pets.  2. The energy refill should give a certain amount of new energy regardless of where you are at rather than refill up to 110.   3. Since I am on the most current available case, it takes too long waiting for new case to open. 4. Sticker packs are a horrible idea. Should give an option for energy or food.',

Now the game starts but then it’s unresponsive to any input (controller, remote, keyboard). Other games work normally. I tried everything. Running latest version of OS, cleared game cash, game data, uninstalled game, restarted Nvidia Shield then reinstalled game. Same thing, not accepting any other input.  If this problem is resolved, I will edit my review back to 5 stars since I love the game.',
       'Update: the game keeps stealing coins from me. I had 227 coins, won a single prize, immediately play a game or two with the character, and the next time I looked I only had 16 coins. And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I\'d love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn\'t block the view of oncoming traffic.',

     [ 'It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn\'t cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.',
       'Although FoE is very enjoyable, it can get very complicated, especially for new players. The biggest drawback is the lack of instructions...new players, unless taken under the wing of an experienced player, have to fumble through at first, many times guessing or using trial and error to accomplish the simplest things.',
       'At first I was a little unhappy with the amount of stuff I can do with spending diamonds, but I now find it refreshing, not to spend active hours on a game in order to receive a reward. I\'m glad they reward patience.',
       'This is a really good solid game that you can play at your own rate. You don\'t need to spend money and someone can\'t attack and wipe you out in a night. Many faceted play that will keep you busy and entertained from start until......well, ever I guess.',
       'Loving the game so far customer support helped me out quickly when I needed help this game is a fun mix between city building and fighting I\'m enjoying the game if you like this one Elvenar is just as good it\'s made by the same developers',

     [ 'You cannot walk on wooden fundations and you cannot walk on single or double foundations. Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it',
       'It\'s honestly a pretty good game, it\'s fun, even though there\'s no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it\'s really bad, and it\'s insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.',

     [ 'Its a relaxing game to enjoy. It is competitive, but not over bearing to where all there is, is competition. I have always been a fan of solitaire games since they were on windows pc computers on dial up if we wanted to play a game its mostly all we had lol when the connections went down. The game is well made and doesn\'t have that many ads for a free game its nice. Well done',
       'It is a beautiful well balanced game, however too many ads, and unable to turn off sounds on the ads. The algorithm could be a bit harder. I knows it\'s a money maker for you with no real incentive to offer a paid version. But I would gladly pay $1 to rid the ads.',
       'Began with little to no adds... then ads after every hand is just too much.  Annoying.  It did not take you that much to make this game, so ease off on the ads.  Or offer a paid version for a buck.  Add an upgrade now option so I can just pay in-app to get rid of the ads.',
       'The game play is nice, and the ads are not to intrusive, but i am giving this a one star because of the AUDIBLE ads. The seem to only come o  at night and gets VERY annoying. Especially when my wife or kids are sleeping and then this rediculously loud add pops up and you cant skip it.',
       'The game itself is good: Unlimited undo moves is nice, the hints are usually helpful, and the "wining game" option is awesome BUT the number and type of ads (usually ones that can\'t be navigated away from for at least a couple of seconds) are ridiculous! Open up the app =&gt; you get an ad...Finish or restart a game =&gt; there\'s another ad...Change the mode you are playing in =&gt; yep, you get hit with an ad...Switch to another app then return to play the game you already watched the ad for =&gt; about half the time you are forced to sit through yet another ad! Sometimes you get lucky and an ad doesn\'t play under one of those circumstances, but it is a rare occurrence. I\'m going to try to find a less irritating solitar game because after just 1 week with this app is getting to be too much for me :/',
       'This is a great app...especially compared to almost all other solitaire apps. Unfortunately, just as every other FREE game app, there are ads...QUICK FIX: PUT YOUR PHONE/TABLET ON AIRPLANE MODE...PROBLEM SOLVED! The ad volume will turn all the way down as long as the MEDIA VOLUME on your device is turned down. "Winning game" games are always winning games...thats why the unlimited games feature is awesome bc u can "Restart" the game and play it over and over. No "tokens/credits" involved, so you can play as long as your like. Some of the reviews on here are really petty. This is a great app. Go ahead and download a "better" app...i promise you will find yourself back to this one!!! I really have zero complaints about this app 🤗' ],

     [ 'EDIT: My main complaint was the constant downloading, but I just discovered that you can do a Batch Download through the settings! I recommend doing it after you are done rerolling (4000+ files), but it makes the game SO MUCH BETTER!   My other issue is a personal preference: I wish I could play this in portrait mode. Landscape only makes it somewhat less than a mobile game IMO.   That being said, the game itself is AMAZING.',
       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. The Color stones that are locked, can\'t be unlocked using gems anymore. Didn\'t see it in update, please fix.',
       'Best mobile final fantasy game out there. You get all characters without money. The only thing you pay for is gems for weapons and armour. Haven\'t paid a cent yet and can complete the hardest content to date.',
       'Great game to pass the time. Love the nastoligia. I hope more variety of monsters come soon. Bat,goblin,bomb,wolf repeat....haha. there are more but still pretty lacking given how many are in game. I like the progression system a lot and easy to farm gems.',
       'Great Final Fantasy game. Though the combat is a bit more simplified than a typical FF (since it tries to emulate Dissidia\'s Bravery system in a turn based setting) it still requires thought in your actions and deciding when to hit HP or not. In terms of content, the story is an interesting take on Dissidia\'s lore and it seems to focus more on the mundane interactions between the diverse array of characters.  Story chapters are still being released (looked up what to expect from the current Japanese version and we still have a ways to go) thus introducing more and more characters. Overall it\'s a fun take on the FF franchise that brings together many of the characters that remind fans why we got into it in the first place. My only gripe is that chapters 8 and 9 can\'t get here soon enough (2 characters i am particularly looking forward to)',
       'I\'m so sad I missed out on getting Squall! Must have been an event-only thing. Oh well, I managed to get Setzer and Vanille, so that\'s something. Game is great, can\'t wait for the rest of the story. Also will any other characters from other Dissidias be in this? I\'d love to have me a Lightning or Tidus.' ],

The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can\'t return to the game.

       'Can you explain how someone " logged into your account" and kicked you out in multiplayer ?  Not that it happens often, but when you\'ve spent 50 diamonds for a one hour key and you lose 3 to 4 minutes  getting back in the game it sucks. How can your game allow this to happen !!! At least design a way to return the time lost to the player. Thank you.',

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'Winnings suck. Instructions are very vague. Way too many ads. Feel like in order to play you have to pay in order accomplish levels and continue story campaign. Sorry guys but I bet my criticism has been said over and over again. Result is boredom. Too many other games to waste my time playing. Need to fix these if you wish to keep this game on the market people!!!!',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time.

     [ 'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite"ZEUS SLOTS". Not fair, I\'m not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is" WILD STARS"  . However, "ZEUS" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.',
       'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!',
       'People are losing alot of money in this. This game no fun no more. And all u say are im sorry to hear....blablabla....it is imposibble to win and when we win some we lose a alot. Huuge dont care about our complain as long they make money. More player hurts, more player lose, they just dont care as long peoples make them income. Very very bad game.' ],

     [ 'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can "regrow" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It\'s so simple but soothing and really addictive!!',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.' ],

Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe',
       'It\'s a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.',
       'Temple run is one of the best game all time. Ally friends and relatives have this game in their mobile. It sounds more interesting. It is so good and time runs so fast if we start playing temple run. I like this game so much and I\'m thankful to the ones who created this game. It also makes us more addictive...',
       'I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it\'s like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn\'t die like the heck',
       'The game is cool but there\'s a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won\'t let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit' ],

     [ 'I love the game, the crafting system is awesome, the gameplay is great. However, there are some points that I suggest  1. Nerf the Damned, also the Lepers, they are strong for beginners. Club can\'t beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don\'t know if it is a bug or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It\'s a great game to be honest.',
       'This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.',
       'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       'It does look good but I get the feeling it\'s a "stolen" idea of the game Last Day on Earth because it\'s almost the exact same thing with a few minor differences. But I\'m ok with that. I have both games and play them both. But this game has very sketchy game play, even with the graphics on low on my device, it\'s all fidgity while collecting in the resource areas. This game, though I think has better overall visuals that LDON, it still has a ways to go to get to a better game play as LEON. Keep up the good work!',
       '16 energy to move to the nearest forest!! Don\'t expect to build your house or collect resources in a day. This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',
       'As I have not heard of this game (it showed up in my recommendations), I would like to say that this game is beautiful! I do recommend other people to play it. The graphics are highly amazing and basic control is outstanding! I love the idea on how you can pick up items that you put down and rearrange your base the way you want it. Although, I did have several connection issues, but overall everything is in tiptop condition. Keep up the good work!' ],

     [ 'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'It\'s a really great game! I\'m really looking forward to an update. I think it\'d be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I\'m looking forward to see what you guys do!',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can\'t hit a single shot so I have to restart the game.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'I gave the game another chance after my last review because the game is fun but it is my last time.. I am uninstalling and never again playing mlbb. I got afkers on my team in 4 consecutive classic games, and I still get feeders even though my rank is quite high.. why do I get paired up with feeders, I have no clue.  Goodbye mlbb, was great when I acually got a decent team and is actually capable of winning instead of having no chance at all and get trashtalked by opponents thinking they are all that.',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'I like the game. My low rating is because I had to reset my phone and now have to go 8 lvl again just to reload into my account. It\'s bad enough you are forced to play the practice modes over again but lvl 8 is almost to ranked again. Why put that time in again. Lvl 5 maybe/understandable. But you\'ve made me not want to play this game anymore and it\'s sad because I enjoyed it',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out' ],

Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',

       'This brain definitely makes me feel like the front of my head is working. But the constant advertisements between every few levels is very annoying. Especially when a level takes 15 seconds and the ad runs the same length.  Would suggest the paid version if you like it.' ],

     [ 'Quality game only a few issues. Premium crystals need a higher rate of 3 and 4 stars, ive played 3 years and never had higher than a 2 star drop, only ever had 3/4* from 3/4*crystals. Also golden Crystal should drop more than 2400 minimum. Tier 4 class catalysts need to be easier to obtain  Awakening gems could be easier to get aswell. Also odin, beta rey bill, fantastic 4, more xmen',

       'I love the game and the vast amount of playable characters, however the sound effects overall aren\'t great but the gameplay is very good. One problem I do have however is that there are in models (such as thanos and Kang) but you can\'t play as them. Personally thanos is easily my favorite marvel character and the fact that I can\'t use him is a little upsetting. But overall its a great game with monthly updates and great new characters! Can\'t wait for more!',
       'I am using vivo v5 plus.. Game is running smoothly but after current Android update all apps are running good except mcoc.  After one or 2 fights or after 5 to 10min of login, it\'s shows connectivity problem.  Kindly give right patch...  I will give you 5/5',
       'Aftwr the last update I can\'t open the application. It goes to a black screen and thats here it stays.  If this should go on and I lose my rewards because of this I will no longer invest or ppay this game, because wht is the se to play a game 6 months or more just to just lose the one thing you really wanted to get.',
       'Just opened over 40 (premium, 3 star and 4 star) crystals... and got nothing new/useful... f*ing waste!! Extremely huge P.O.S.! Not even worth your time. Rigged P.o.S.!!! Why would anybody put money into this rigged piece of junk?' ],

     [ 'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential',
       'Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don\'t mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉',
       'Best game EVER!! I love this game sooo much! The only problem is that you don\'t get to move on to the next level fast enough. I do hate that so much.And also e everything costs diamonds and u don\'t get alot of that.  But other than that, good game!! Highly recommended.',
       'In the beginning, I absolutely loved this game, but now, I do admit that it get\'s a bit boring and frustrating after a while because getting cash and diamonds without paying real money is incredibly difficult and time consuming. I do like that they fixed the reaction time for voting because it used to be sooo slow. But overall, I highly recommend this game for any kind of fashion lover who is willing to have the patience to play it.' ],

       'I love the game it is so simple yet super fun. Just the only down side is that there are WAY to many ads. I stared playing a round and then an ad pops up.. Like really. At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:',

       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..',
       'Fun simple game burdened by a slew of constant advertising. Ads while you play, full screen timed ad when you restart (99.9% of time) and an optional 1 time 30s full screen ad to resume. Simply put too many ads!' ],

     [ 'This is one of the best strategy RPG I\'ve played in recent years. This is exactly what a mobile RPG should be like.   There are a lot of twists and turns, funny and interesting interactions and I like how the creator is also involved in the game. What I love most about it is that there\'s a story being told. Even after you lose (and you will lose a lot) the story keeps going forward.  The thing I\'m not that big of a fan of is the micro transactions in this game, there are quite a lot of em, I understand why the creator does this but if all of the money he gets from micro transactions goes directly to this game in order to improve the game I\'m all in.  Good job on the game, creator!',
       'Hmh. Where to begin my experience with Lapse? Well, it is a definite "give it at least a try. It is completely free as well. Any money you give to dev will be out of your own willing. And honestly, if you play this game and don\'t give a few cents to this guy, you are either very poor(understandable) or pretty much a cheap arsehole. Clearly the dev worked a lot at this game and the game with his endings and twists and turns is easily worth at least a $5 or £5. It is a simple phone RPG and I honestly had more fun than with games which costed me 10£. Great story, very well written with plot twists and funny characters interactions. Loved it. 8/10',
       'Your actions have consequences, sometimes applying the F-it adjustment is great for rewards. Also really captures the idea that even though you are being corrupt it\'s for the greater good, an interesting perspective. Absolutely love this game',
       'Very interesting concept, there are a lot of mysteries to solve and the game really challenges you to manage what few resources you have carefully. There are few outright good options, most of them force you to expend a resource in order to obtain another (eg let corporations dump nuclear waste for some extra cash), and sometimes despite your best efforts you get killed by radiation or overthrown by your military.',
       'I haven\'t finished the game yet, but this is WILD so far. It\'s very addicting and has me seriously thinking about the consequences of my actions.',

I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game but it takes far too long to progress. Gems are way too far and few between to enable you to \'buy\' better vehicles to defeat the boss. Then you have to also use more gems to get weapons! If you don\'t spend money it takes a long time to get anywhere. If there were more gems available this game would be a 5 star game.',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!',
       'I would give more stars, because it\'s very addictive and fun to pass the time. But it just contains WAY TOO MANY ADS. Like holy crap I  get 3 different ads back to back after every single run. Kills my battery quickly and I spend more time watching the ads than I do actually playing the game.',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.',
       'This game is have potential, don\'t ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What\'s the point of "playing" in this game?',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.' ],

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.' ],

This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you\'d have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun',

Let me just so no to 6 different ads in a row as soon as i log in. Ill be sure to not contact your "concierge" and move on to something better. Maybe an app that actually appriciates feedback.',

Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done.',

     [ 'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.' ],

I enter the details, it tells me that I\'ve already logged in, I go back to the game and it just does the same thing over and over..... Anyone know how to solve this issue? Website is no use at all',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products.',
       'I loved the mighty league ... until it forced an update that caused a glitch, and all of a sudden I was back in the Feather league --- and no matter what I did, I couldn\'t get out of it. I waited for update after update --- but to no avail. I was stuck. Not so fun anymore. So I uninstalled and reinstalled --- and lost over 13,000 points.  But at least I got to play again. I built my way back up... only to have it glitch again, sending me back to the Feather league. More frustrating than fun #Fail' ],

     [ 'Simply wonderful app!! My daughter\'s speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it\'s repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn\'t get enough of it! Now we\'ve moved on to shapes and colours that she\'s working through now at 22months. It\'s truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where \'Z\' sounds out as \'Zed.\'',
       'I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!',
       'A great app love the fact that they included games for the parent LOL  I would like a continuous flow though instead of having to press the forward button every time  you\'re done with one segment',
       'Well I can\'t give 5* till I fully know,but my four yr old loves,it she\'s left handed, and has some problems with some words,so this helps with that,so I think its a great app so far',
       'Thank you very much for making this app available without any advertising or in app purchases, and also allowing it to store on my sd card so as to save my phones internal resources.  It is very much appreciated.',
       'Awesome app! The games are fun and straightforward, the characters are cute and the music is enjoyable. Lots of smart accessibility features for parents, too.' ],

     [ 'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God\'s sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn\'t worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.',
       'I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it\'s said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they\'re not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.',
       'This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.',
       'I don\'t like this update. Why does it cost so much to upgrade  weapons 2 more damage higher. And I don\'t like the fact that all the weapons that have low stars are nerfed. When I was on level 6 the hellraiser was a beast. Then when I got to level 7 I it wasn\'t as good, so I tried to upgrade it. BUT the price cost 120 coins. I am really disappointed about this. I played this game for 2 years and it sad to see how hard it is to win. They only want money that\'s it. Make your game better and fair. It\'s so unbalanced.',
       'It\'s a great game.... until you reach level 27, then there is a REDICULOUS difficulty curve. I was steadily climbing the tornament leaderboard, I was good, then I kept getting destroyed after hitting 27 with OP items and no gems to get the new weapons, because I had spent them leveling up my weapons and was out. What are you thinking? Lag, not double jumping, not firing when I need to, occasionally. How rediculous.' ],

By far the best game that advertises it is not pay to play. Because it\'s not, despite the option to buy coins.',

     [ 'Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D',
       'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed',
       'I love the first one and second game of this but the third one it\'s not so good I feel like no one should get the third one only the first and second Dumb Ways to die you can\'t even play the games you did on the first and games you did on the first and second one only the mini games and it\'s only four of those so this is what I\'m going to say about this app' ],

     [ 'Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don\'t even mind because it\'s still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.',
       'I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I\'ve decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I\'ve upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!',
       'Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.' ],

EDIT: Playtika has opened all the games up again and my progress has been restored. Thanks',
       'Not bad game but payouts suck. When you start the new contest you were able get the hidden parts now after a few days they show up less and less and to get the ones you need to complete the levels it appears the only way is to buy they through the more expensive packages. Not a fan.',

       'I used to love this game but have not been able to play on my phone now for two weeks.  I contacted customer support and was told to wait for game update.  A week later and many updates later I contacted them again and got the exact same "form e-mail" response. EDIT I still cannot play but have been in contact with customer support and waiting for techs to get back to me.',

The moment you complete 90% of the task, the pacient vital sign are dropping and there is no way to get him back. I continuously tryed for several days now and you simply cannot pass that task.

I don\'t get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.',

       'Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they\'d at least be entertaining.',
       'As much as I love Beyblade, this app is really disappointing. The gameplay isn\'t anything special but the worst is the players. There should be a serious punishment for disconnecting. I cannot enjoy the game - I should have won two matches but I got nothing for them because my opponents disconnected the last second. Truly unsatisfying.',

I enjoy playing it but I get the feeling very soon I will have to spend some real pennies and when that happens I will probably stop playing.',
       'Not completely sold on the game. Major problem: hoarfrost was not designed for touchscreen! Trying to clear the frost moves the screen, pulls down drop down menu from the top, pauses repeatedly, zooms & unzooms repeatedly...nightmare! Game has too much going on with collections, story, various games....to enjoy the game. I like the parts where I find stuff. The rest just gets in the way and bores me.',
       'I really enjoyed this game but same problem as someone else since you have updated it it just says waiting for WiFi. I had problems when you updated it before and in the end had a new phone started again and now this problem. Why does problems happen when you do and update. I have got to a good level again and I really don\'t want to start again. It\'s a shame as I really think this is or was the best game I\'ve played.  Please sort it',
       'Good game and great entertainment so far, been playing for about 10 days. Some levels challenging but not enough to be discouraging. Good way to develop focus, observation and memory. Those rubies are hard to get though and expensive in real money...',
       'I\'m addicted to this game.  You don\'t have to spend money to enjoy it either.  Illustrated beautifully and I love the fact items move around plus also have different modes to keep you intrigued. I only find it frustrating not having enough energy to keep seeking',

THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',

I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',

     [ 'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I\'m not a game player, but this game is a lot of fun, AND, you never have to spend a dime! Of course, unless you want to spend money!  I do wish the direction went into a little more depth. It would make it a little easier for new people to understand the extra things, like the snow boarding and the regatta.' ],

     [ 'So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',
       'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis.

       'Nice game challenging to think ahead. But, basically this game is cheating on you. Levels are far too difficult to complete without boosters. So, after failing several times the not so random appearing tiles give you a lot of boosters.

When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',

All in all, if you could do that, it\'d make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there\'s no use for coins.',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'First off, I\'d like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It\'s amazing.  However, I\'ve been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can\'t pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I\'m on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.',
       'This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I\'m very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing..

     [ 'I played this a while back and decided to come back and see if anything had changed and it sure did. There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I\'m glad I\'m playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.' ],

In the future sometimes instead of race can there a event where multiple players fight a power boss like dragon and the people are given prizes depending on there rank and they have to do a certain amount of damage to get the rewards instead of just letting them get it without trying',
       'Don\'t waste your time with this game. It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don\'t give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don\'t waste your time with this game.',

Theres so many Heroic dragons and legendaries that are level 30+, and now they all use the right "hits" everytime, and when you don\'t have any "good" dragons, it is very hard to win. Previous battle system was rly good, when those dragons used random hits.',

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍',

As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game☺',

I would like to see mpre options for alliances in the future. Perhaps a deceptions option list where you can try to steal from other players without fighting. Stuff like that.   Otherwise enjoyable.',
       'This game favors the higher level players or those willing to pay. You\'ll get top level 5 or 6 and get attacked by someone at least twice your level and lose all your resources. It\'ll take days for your forces to be healed cause it takes resources to heal them, which were stolen. Anyone you attack won\'t have much resources for you to steal cause they\'ve either given up on the frame or too low of a level to have anything, so it\'s a huge waste of time. You can get a shield, but you have to buy what you can\'t get for free. It\'s a shame cause it\'s an okay game.',

     [ 'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10',
       'Need to fix glitches in the lunges. Stunned when picking up a coin or going through it in to a enemy when instead of stopping. Random stuns even you have a successful strike. And you need to put more green and red guys in sooner. Also theres a glitch where the black dot turns grey and you strike but its too early.' ],

BUT may photos temperature started to climb and quickly shot through the roof to a point where it literally burns you! And it kills your battery! For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.',
       'This is a cute little fun game but it keeps crashing I can\'t even open it so therefore that\'s why you got such low reviews. I was having a lot of fun with it until it started crashing. Even uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem. I hope you eventually get it fixed it would be worth downloading again.',
       'Looks BORING at first. But I can\'t put it down now. And to those complaining about the adds, spam the back button after they start. The only adds this doesn\'t work for are the ones with the fast forward button in the top left',
       'Silly pointless battery killing little game, I loved it! The game kinda runs out of puff after level 150 though, as there is nothing else to achieve. I\'ve got all the prestige balls, all the regular balls, all above level 150. Can we have some higher order balls above Thunder please?',
       'AD INFESTED! Opens up adds (videos) every time you level up pretty much, which is every 5-15 seconds in the beginning. I cannot give this a proper review when half the game is just watching ads.',

Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.' ],

It hasent changed since when I usted to have it it would be nice to get some new maps or bikes and maybe change the layout of the menu. And maybe even a multipler more where u play with other people/friends and just free ride or challenge to see who can get more points. Other then that it is a crazy fun and addictive game.',

Like when you start, in the first levels(the docks)...You move and the bike rolls down but when you move up the next slope it doesnt....You should work on that. One more thing......You should not keep all levels payed. You should keep it like, if you beat a certain record or you finish the course faster than the time given already. Otherwise, HATS OFF TO YOU ILLUSION LABS...GREAT WORK!!!',

Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.',
       'Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.',
       'This a pay to win game with lootboxes of different packs. They will keep making you spend with micro transaction of useless stuff to get the real thing you seek. Once, they took my money and the item was not delivered to me because i asked refund before, for a pack called "hope gemstones pack" but after 3 times of 20 bucks purchases, i did not get a single hope gemstone. A scam game in a very good way to steal your money. On the other hand, the game is very addictive and well made. If only the developer has a bit of decency..',

APPLE users now have a clear advantage over Android users.   So dont talk aboit you vare about customers… they don\'t . Clearly an APPLE culture designer.  Still haven\'t posted Android tablet update to ver 1.5 (droid haters)',
       'I really like the game at first. I gave it 5 stars but after a few weeks, i change to 3 stars only. Every time after the update, i cannot play the game. It always "connection problem. please reconnect" and until now i cannot play the game anymore. This game only wants your money.' ],

     [ 'An interesting game, it gives the planes a slightly paper feel when viewing them. However, the actual controls are smooth although they can be slightly twitchy at times. The addition of game modes recently was a welcome change to the game and has helped me through many hours of boredom. This game overall is very good and I advise you download it.',
       'Awesome......  I love this game.....  So good know!  Nice game but too much adds.....  U can make some more  planes ae paid.....  But plz remove adds.....  U make some planes to buy in real money too....  Also some levels too...  But worst thing is adds...  Plz remove them all',
       'Last update killed it. Can\'t even see the bottom row to select anything. It\'s covered by an ad and the aircraft selection covers it as well and won\'t go away. Makes it unplayable.',
       'Paying doesnt remove ads, not worth it.  UPDATE 2/24/18, still no reconciliation from the developer on the pay scam. I\'ll be going to Google for a refund. I do not recommend this app.  This is a fun game - one you can pick up for a few minutes, or for an hour. I played it before the challenge modes and was still entertained. The ease of use combined with incresing intensity keeps you very engaged. Heres the catch - TOO MANY ADS!   I paid the $3 for an "no ads" experience, only to encounter the same ads that appear in game and after every round, and on screen. The only thing paying for it does is shorten the ad run time, so you can close them after about 5-10 seconds. I am not pleased about this and would not have paid for it if I had known.   Buyers beware...',
       'Way to many adds and when I paid to remove them they were still there. Tried to contact them and they never replied. Had to get a refund through Google play. Don\'t waste your time with this app.',

But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything\'s a BIT expensive... Other than that, It\'s a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤',

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐',

     [ 'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don\'t waste it here. Good luck!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!' ],

They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',

I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',

     [ 'I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn\'t be a issue if it didn\'t take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.',
       '**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.',
       'Alright, so I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like this one is deserved. The games concept is great, as with most post-apocalyptic zombie games, surviving and building a base is the main goal. Great. However, it is a micro-transaction based game, meaning you have to pay for packages if you actually want to enjoy it to the fullest. Am I saying you can t enjoy it otherwise? No, I do and I don\'t pay for the packages, however, my house constantly gets destroyed, I\'m killed by other players who do pay, and my game progression is massively slow. So, I don\'t really recommend this game, if you actually want to "play" the game.',
       'Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don\'t make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it\'s an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?',
       'Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you.',
       'This game truly amazing with beautiful graphics, decent yet easy controls, a large amunt of items and okay customization. The only reason i give this a 4 star rating is because one thing. The hoard mechanic. I mean it\'s a good concept. The only problem is that there\'s a hoard every 24 hours. And since wood is kinda pain to get it sucks to come back after work to come to a destroyed house. If it was like every month or heck even every week that would be fine just please give more time than 24 hours for a hoard' ],

     [ 'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It\'s not really fair for those who aren\'t of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there\'s a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)',
       'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game.',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted' ],

     [ 'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'Good for killing time. Some of the computer driven opponents seem to have a very decisive advantage at initial start of certain stages, and some of the smaller vehicles are too sensitive on the controls  but overall decent game.',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.',
