     [ 'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'Fun game, addactive, enjoyable. However forcing ads on the player after ever 2 hits is out of order. You already let us double our winnings by watching ads so why make us watch them when we don\'t want to? Take that out and add in an option to watch an ad for coins. Do that and I\'ll happily give you 5 stars.',
       'This game seems like it could be a great time waster... If it weren\'t for the whole crashing after every round when it tries to load an ad or when you try to watch an ad to upgrade something for free. I see nothing wrong with having these ads here.... As long as they don\'t affect app stability',
       'To everyone complaining about the ads, quit being so cheap and give the $2.49 to buy the game and remove them. Once the ads are removed, it\'s addictive and fun to keep getting the ball further. Fun concept and well executed. I\'ve already gotten more than my $2.49 worth of fun out of this game, and continue to play it.',
       'One star for the fact that after every single at bat they throw an ad at you. And half you can not skip early. I understand the need for ad\'s but Jesus Christ not after every turn. I normally pay to turn ads off but since the developers wanted to go ad crazy I\'m not paying a cent and just delete.',
       'Too easy of a game. Once u upgrade ur strength to 30 plus you have to take into account of the angles. You never want to hit the ball perfect because it\'s  Impossible to hit the ball flush that it aligns with the dotted lane. Oh yeah for those saying ads, turn off the Wi-Fi and play.' ],

That\'s forgiveable because it\'s out of the way and doesn\'t really affect gameplay. It\'s the fail-state adevertisements that constantly interrupt retrys that will irritate even the most casual of gamers.   The only people writing good reviews for this game are bot accounts.',

Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',

I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',

There is at least two ads per game. Some of the ads go landscape to further increase game play pleasure, X one out and Bam! Bonus round go straight to the app store to see the ad you X\'ed out available for download. Go back and BAM try the X again YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACE. Good times were had played ten games and uninstalled. ADWARE ten millions downloaded how many kept it longer than twenty minutes.',
       'It\'s so fun with all the different types of patterns.im telling you its the best game you will play in your life.When I die it\'s actually quite good, because the last time I did had 100 to spend and when I had passed the next 4 rounds I had 10,000 to spend so you should realy get this game,and Change your life people.Plus the new thing is the star block makes you invincible for a short amount of time for example I was going when I had 93 and I went in 24 star and I Could go through 100 and 123,000 for 1 minute. Anyway great game if you liked my review go onto Episode to see that review. Hope you love the game. Oh and I forgot to tell you a list of all the patterns we have purple, green,rainbow,pink,🍔,💵,🚗 and grey.',

It forces me in corners where I\'m definitely dead or the good boxes are in corners where i can\'t go because of the walls and that also means im dead. Please make it less random or ar least make that if i comith to a path and because of the game i cant chage is, at least dont make the first mistake ista death.',

       'Guys this game is the best offline game I have ever played as it is toooooo much addictive. U would not believe me, firstly u would die very easily but as u play on then it would be easy to create high score. It also makes your reflexes more faster. The creators have done a great work. And people who are saying there are lots of adds are talking rubbish.  Play it!!!!!',
       'It\'s to many ads like beyond the amount I\'ve seen on any other app. You lose a life then there a 30 sec ad after every time you lose a life. When the ads over you jump right back into the game. Making it difficult to play because it doesn\'t give you enough time to make your next move. If they remove the ads may it would be a better game.' ],

     [ 'Good but £4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE\'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren\'t) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.' ],

Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',

     [ 'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',

Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'The levels in the game got insanely difficult on the first day after downloading and playing the game. Some of these levels take a days just to beat one and you only get one star which doesn\'t do anything.  I can appreciate that someone from the team responded to what I have to say.   The scarf game makes levels a bit better, when you have the lives to play coninously for an hour.',
       'I gave it three stars because not too far along in the game, it turns into a "pay to win" game. Some boards simply don\'t give you enough moves, so you\'re forced to use coins to continue or retry and lose a life.  I don\'t mind hard games, but I detest micro transactions being needed so soon into it.. I\'m at level 24, that\'s it, and already the board doesn\'t even give you a fighting chance to beat it without using coins.' ],

Make it more like the casino game before it was changed, single window main with four bonus screens, player claims all wins, OR, keep four main windows with higher minimum bet and have four window bonus screens but player MUST claim all wins.  I am level 48 and bought my way to platinum status. Higher level players ( larger bets) wouldn\'t mind buying coins regularly if it were more fun.',
       'This game is scarily greedy. Today I started playing with 10 million coins. Four hundred (400+) plus goes later and still no free spins. That just doesn\'t happen in the real world, so the game has been manipulated against the player and in favour of the owner. Still had 300k+ coins in credit and started getting "your balance is getting low" messages. **WASTE OF MY AND YOUR TIME**',
       'Tighter than the real ones...  These are supposed to be entertaining.  The games are some of my very favorites in real life, but these aren\'t fun.  NOTHING paid, bonuses are nearly impossible to get and weak when you do get one.  The free coins are in such small amounts you can\'t play long on them.    Loosen it up a bit and it\'s an easy 5 stars from me.',

Stay away. Heart of Vegas will only allow you to play if you spend',
       'The free coins amounts are way to small. To be a free site you would expect to start off with a large amount. Either allow punters to get the feel of a real casino and give them larger amounts or bonuses. If any site advertise a large amount of coins and you do not get that amount then that site is a scam. Also free coins is the hook to get punters in and when your coins are gone that you either have to pay or you delete. If you pay i ask what do you get when you pay ?. If you pay at a casino at least you get something but not on the internet. One site i had a large amount and soon it was all gone as it took so long to get any scatters and the payout was very small and that is a scam. Same here when the amounts to play are large but the free credits are small.',

All of a sudden however you guys have decided to restrict those hourly gifts to 200,000! How are we supposed to play these games when most of these slots by default are asking us to bet several hundred thousand credits at a time? And yes, I do buy coin packs on rare occasions, but I shouldn\'t have to just to play this game! 😒',
       'I think its fantasic i would like to see more coin bonuses as i dont always have the money to buy. Highly recommend it! 👌 be refreshing to see replies to good rateings not just the bad ones. Seriously who cares about the bad. 😂',

       'Fafafa gold slots are very easy slots for Jackpots. They hourly to 3 hours  bonus. They also once a day a daily spin. Levels up really fast. Now I have tried to purposely get rid of this game. However Every time I tried I would win more.  I really put it to the test. Thank you.',

It shouldn\'t be 9 gold bars for a second chance. If I\'m going to pay 9 gold bars then at least give me more than 5 moves for it. Besides all of that, I love candy crush. Just recently downloaded soda crush as well, love it! Keep it up!',

I recomend this game to everyone, i realy love that you can play it offline and with other players! Even if the gamers at school say this ias a stupid game, i think it is fantastic!.I live that you get candy powerups everyday instead of using your gold too!',

I will continue to play for free and just like always eventually you will "let me win" my current level. And when I run out of lives I will play words with Friends and solitaire;)',

When you get ROBUX don\'t bully people defend them from cyberbulling. Yes there is bulling. Just express yourself. Trust me, you will LOVE this game :D',
       'I want to complain that I was signed out of my account for saying 1 bad word. It was an auto correct or an accident "fat fingers" occasion and I am really unimpressed with that decision. The only reason that it is still 4 stars from me is because the games are really good. I will be deleting app if I get locked out again. And I am sure you would not like that.',

Also, I like the items and clothing on the catalog, so that you can change your avatar - remember, you need to pay for the clothing with robux! If people call you noobs, don\'t listen to them. Just be yourself. There are some bullies of there: just stay away from them :D',

     [ 'This might be the worst game I\'ve ever played on my phone. The controls are absolutely impossible. I move barely to the left or right and fly off the road.',
       'Too many ads.',
       'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is a challenge within itself. I normally prefer to play game games that are satisfactory. But this game is very wonderful. As it comprisses of a rolling ball that is running over  an uneven path. So basically there can be competition between the bro who travelled the most distance. It also requires a good solid attention power along with patience.. So i would say its anice game. As of gameplay the is no ending or starting in the game it directly starts and that makes it more interesting. But at the same time also boring. But i would say that if u download this game u will definitely uninstall it after almost a month. Good game and waiting for an update ✌️',
       'Maybe you could add coins, for example each gate you go through could +1 Coin and you need like 290 Coins to upgrade your airtime by a few seconds or milliseconds, although the sound is not very good due to no sound at all. Very good game although!' ],

But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',

Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.

Since MOST of the guild is left out, how can I give them a Fortune ticket as stated?? There is a comparable  $4.99 offer that gives 50 Fortune chest, 2000 gems, and resources.

Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time.

     [ 'Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',
       'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       'Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It\'s also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3' ],

The graphics are simple, but considering everything else, it\'s nothing to complain about. This is on a phone after all, not a PS4. However, nearly all weapons besides the hunting rifle, though possible to attain, require an insane amount of in game currency. So unless you like micro transactions, or have an insane amount of free time, you\'ll probably only ever have the hunting rifle. 8.5/10',

So not sure why the high ratings.',

Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',

Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.',
       'This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn\'t lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it\'s better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don\'t want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well.

COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'I like the game, but I have a few things I would like added. One thing is instead of joystick controls maybe there could be an option that allows you to have buttons to move like in vehicle mode where you can switch from the gas pedal to the four buttons. Also I would love a first person mode, I think that would make the game so much cooler and better, just a new way of playing. And Maybe a mode like a TDM would be cool. Just some suggestions, thanks for reading love the game!',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Why is there no controller support!!!!! For a game like this it is imperative for good controls. Playing on a touch screen is alright but I would like to be able to use a controller and considering controller support has been out sense android 4.0 this wouldn\'t even limit your customer base as I doubt any 4 year old phones can even play your game above 10fps. It seems like it is deliberately being left out and it is baffling me. Please can we use our controllers it\'s such a simple api to implement!!!! Seriously I think monkeys can implement controllers in games quicker then you guys what the hell!!',
       'This game takes way to much time and effort to download. First you have to download the game, then you have to download additional files for the game. Then you have download additional files for the game AGAIN and guess what after that? Down loading more files. Once that\'s over you start the game. THEN IT STARTS DOWNLOADING SOME BECAUSE ITS THE FIRST START. Then you download a packet verifying thw game. And then you redownload the entire game. That is beyond ridiculoua and such a waste of time for this game its a fun vame buy no way near worth all the time and effory.',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.' ],

     [ 'This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn\'t at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you\'re playing as. Perfect game. 😁👍  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There\'s an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can\'t do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.',
       'I think it\'s incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.',
       'Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company\'s stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.',
       'I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you\'re done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.',
       'First of all, congratulations on the full release! I\'ve been playing this game for a few months now and I\'m absolutely hooked. Whenever I\'m bored or don\'t want to use my phone\'s data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading',
       'It\'s simple in design and gameplay but not boring. Much better than other life simulator games.  I\'ve been playing this since while it was in beta and enjoyed it more with each improvement and update. I\'m looking forward to what else they add.  My only problem with it is job selection is boring and there is no way to save the current life you\'re in in case you want to come back to it at a later time.' ],

     [ 'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.' ],

     [ 'Lots of fun and challenging trying to find the best placement for a word to maximize your score.   The one objection I have relates to the dictionary.  When checking a word\'s meaning in the dictionary that any opponent played, and I don\'t recognize,  the dictionary will sometimes say that it is an acceptable word for Words with Friends, but no definition is available at this time.  I believe that when playing a game having to do with vocabulary, no word that does not have a dictionary definition should be allowed!  What determines if it is a legitimate  word if not found in a dictionary?',
       'Have been playing for years and the enhancements keep improving it. This is not Scrabble. It\'s a different game wth its own features. Use those features and enjoy. It\'s hard enough to earn coins to make use of the features a rarity rather than the norm. And Word Strength (always available) is great - you can just accept your lower value word or challenge yourself to work even harder to find a better one. It\'s a great game - especially as once you\'ve had a go, you can leave it for hours (or days!) and only play when you have time. 😊',
       'Good game. Only problem there are games that left for 16 + days and you can\'t get rid of them. Even when you nudge the person ... nothing happens. This impacts on starting new games with those who want to play! Please sort this out. Ads too long in version 2. Would rate better if this was sorted.',
       'Good gameplay. I enjoy playing this game. Great for expanding vocabulary. However, too many words that are acceptable without definitions. Should be a way to submit definitions for words, or maybe link with a dictionary app. Additionally, what\'s with the ads after every move? I end up closing game and restarting, it\'s quicker than watching the ads. If they where shorter, I would let them play.',
       'I really enjoy playing with my friends, just another way to keep in touch even though you\'re miles away! You can also meet and play new folks, as well as play all of the various challenges the game has to offer while you are playing. For example, you earn coins for different words played, difficulty of words played, or words with certain letters. If you enjoy just playing to play or playing for a challenge, this game has it all!',
       'It\'s a lot of fun but... 1. The ads seem to be longer in the latest version, 2. It\'s ridiculous to have words that don\'t mean anything,  3. The lightning race against a team is the best part but there needs to be some good prizes for winning, 4. I love the Solo challenges and I wish they would be scheduled to coincide with the big special events that give about 80 points for a win. I tend to be finished with the Solo event before the big special one begins.' ],

     [ 'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'Creative...I have noticed that a majority of winning designs are poor in design and get 5 Stars. I don\'t think voters are taking the time to vote for the best of two and are just punching the = sign to get through the process. Would like ability to buy table, wall art and floor plants with both diamonds and cash. More videos to earn diamonds. Fix the video for diamonds feature-it keeps sticking in the "loading" mode. A more equal purchase/design ability would be appreciated. Increase daily reward and diamonds.' ],

This is an awesome game with some great stories but unfortunately you need diamonds to make alot of decisions and you don\'t get given many as they want you to buy them.  So there\'s no way you can play the game properly. The diamonds are so over priced. If they were cheaper I might be inclined to buy them. So with regret I\'m going to have to delete this game. Greedy people thanks for ruining what could have been a fun game.',

It has been nearly ten month of my being connected with Choices, and I can still say that it would last for a much longer time. Keep going Choices team.',

     [ 'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       'Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!',
       'I was over the moon when they put Mysteries of the past on. I hope they can do the same with The conspiracy as well. All 4 games are a must have. You\'ll never find another game like these. I love playing them because they\'re brilliant & addictive, I hope they continue to make more.',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant' ],

     [ 'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ],

It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn\'t take long it\'s a simple engine.',

     [ 'The game is good to play. But even though you have guessed the word it doesn\'t submit until you\'ve spent coins to get hints. This happens after every 3/4 levels. After it happened for the sixth to seventh time, I started making a note of what words I tried. Not good, needs fixing ASAP. Luckily for me, I\'m not one to waste money buying coins.',
       'Should be able to spell words no matter how many letters are only recommend. Would\'ve had a lot more coins if that wasn\'t such a limiting factor. Definitions should be added after word is found in case user wants to know what he/she spelled. At least, I want to know what the definition is. That way, I am learning new words. Enhancing my vocabulary as what this app was created/designed for. Right? Right?',
       'Easy but good at least rn. Im just begining. Sometimes it doesnt accept some words but its great to play to kill time. The adds arent bad and they\'re pretty short. Great game for entirr family! The game does get tougher as you go one. I like the fact that you can change the theme as well! Its nice that you don\'t have to look at the same thing over and over. It seems some boards are really easy and others are extremely difficult but a great game!!',
       'Really enjoyed the game. Fun to play, keep coming back, sometimes letters are too close together and it is hard to select the ones you want without others getting in the way. The present doesn\'t ever give me above 39 coins. It\'s either rigged or I am very unlucky.',
       'This game could be a lot of fun, except that there are many words in the English language that this game does not recognize and accept. There are many, many words that should be given as extra credit, but this game does not acknowledge that they are even words. Please, expand your knowledge base and change the game so that it accepts ALL words as extra words. Also, you do accept some "things" as words that ARE NOT words, such as abbreviations and contractions.  Example:  \'etc\' and \'its\' are NOT words. If you do a little research and update the game, then I will come back and give you 5 stars.',
       'A lot of fun and a challenge to your mind!  There were a lot of adds, but if you paid for some coins (at any price package you wanted) they went away.  After I did that my experience has been much more enjoyable!' ],

     [ 'Sooooooo addicting ,I love this game so fun,  relaxing and has great music. I can\'t stop playing. So awesome,they should make more word searches or word crosses like these kind of games. All though  you have to pay for some parts of the game but out of all the games I have ever played this on is #1😍😂😃',
       'My favorite word game, but I rated it only 4 stars because they repeat some of the puzzle groups as you progress through the game. I have gone through the Ocean group of puzzles at least twice now. With all the words in the English language, there is no reason for this. Also, there are many words, most quite common, that are not accepted.',
       'I love this game! It\'s a real challenge and better than the normal ones because of the backgrounds and how it\'s a crossword. You could add an online player vs player thing too. I love the daily challenges. Maybe add something to win instead of coins? If you love a good daily challenge defiantly get the game!! 😊',
       'Game itself is good but to have an advert appear everytime you get to the next level is a bit much. It\'s always the same adverts and it\'s not easy to close the advert. It directs you to playstore to install the app that is being advertised.  I know you need to make money for making this app but the ads are spoiling what was once nice to play. I use it less and less each time I see an ad.',
       'The only bad thing about this game is the sheer volume of ads. I understand it\'s to push you to spend money but it\'s more likely to stop me playing. Tone them back a little and it\'ll make for a much more enjoyable experience that I would be happy to recommend to friends. Ads are a fair trade off for a free game, but not at this current frequency.',
       'Fabulous word game. The whole family is addicted. Could do with a slightly wider vocabulary in that sometimes you find a perfectly good word that is not in the grid but it\'s not allowed in the bonus bank. But that\'s just being picky. Overall, well, well worth the modest price to go ad-free. Highly recommended.' ],

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can\'t upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄' ],

     [ 'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I\'m from Michigan,we\'re both married ,but there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜' ],

     [ 'The 30 host cap immediately becomes pretty difficult to work around, especially when you need to have duplicates of the  hosts to increase their max level cap/attribute score as well as duplicates of hosts for hat colours. I\'m hoping there\'s a way to increase this later in the game. Also, synthblood is incredibly difficult to obtain especially when you need more to fix higher level hosts. Overall though, the game is pretty generous with currency, so I don\'t think I\'ve ever ran into a hard building wall that made me think I had to spend money on it to progress further. So far, I\'m enjoying the game and looking forward to the updates',
       'I\'m very happy to have stumbled upon this game to satiate my cravings while I wait for season 2. I am enjoying this game so far. It keeps me hooked at a comfortable distance, not demanding. I love the quirky animations, the charming stylized set and character designs. My only qualm about the gameplay is the waiting time in Diagnostics. I thought spending 40gems for an additional host slot would mean two hosts being diagnosed at the same time. Instead I find out the 40gems was for the que. Also I\'m confused about the Escalante Technician daily task. I have completed the test in the church and yet the system is not rewarding me for it. Is there a particular test in Escalante that I have to do? Anyway great job to the game devs!',
       'Pros: 1. Good design and SFX 2. Balanced currency and gameplay 3. Detailed and reasonably complex  Cons: 1. Unnecessary level cap (level 25). I noticed that after reaching level 25, no additional exp is received for doing stuff.  I hope this level cap is removed, as there are still Escalante missions that require level 30, 35,..., 50 to take part in.  I feel like I am wasting my time and effort by catering on hosts when my supposed XP for those actions are neglected simply because the limit is at level 25 right now, when it should be at 50.  Please fix this, I really like playing this game. But because of this premature level capping, I\'m afraid this would significantly lessen my motivation in playing and spending on the game. Thanks.',
       'Great game and pretty entertaining.',
       'So far so good. Few glitches but its fine.',
       'im stuck on the loading screen and im at level 13. overall its a pretty good game. but it lacks something. may i suggest: trait inheritance of a target host. sending gift/social points shouldnt restart from the top. warehouse to an inactive host human worker characters hard swipe to change location/map delos room upgrades' ],

     [ 'I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I\'m already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I\'m already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..',
       'Very addicting! HATE the new update! I have to get the feel of each game all over again in order to win. For the amount people spend to play, the 3 HOURS you wait to collect your coins',
       'Why do you people have to control everything. My last 7 spins on your Wheel of Fun I got 36 thousand coins 7 times in a row that is not possible unless you control the spins you should do right by your players. Your rating has gone down from 4 in a half to 3 if you continue to do wrong by all your players your ratings will continue to go down and other who do not about how good you games could be. I hope you don\'t think your players are stupid you will start to lose these people. Please do right by your players.',
       'It\'s a lot of fun. I live in Las Vegas, lol, but this is the only slot game I have on my cell phone. My only other is a Texas Holden game that\'s also fun. Definitely recommend this game. Can become addictive if you love playing slots. The first 100 spins were free! 😄👍',
       'I\'m on level 373 and it only gives you 8 status points. It could give more points when going to the next level. Also seems like after purchasing coins you lose them pretty fast. But enjoy all of the different games!',
       'Simply amazing. Would be better if winning odds improve. This casino has  amazing graphics, winning is one of the lowest.   Kudos to the removal of the 5 spin auto and the addition of 50, it was awesome. Also thank you for keeping advertising low, other casino apps flood tbe screen with ads.' ],

     [ 'Fun, graphics are nice. Free money goes quickly and some of the games bonuses and free spins some have decent ones but infrequent.. They want you to spend real money like most online slots but if you don\'t play for a couple days and just collect the daily free coins you can play for a little while every few days. Unfortunately there isn\'t a lot of opportunity to get free coins. The wins don\'t out weigh the losses but that is usually like it is in real casinos so  at least you don\'t lose real money :) If your patient and don\'t continue to buy the "sale" packages but rather build up the free daily spins.  I just play other slot games  until the free coins build up a little on this one so I can play for awhile. I do like the game though, lots of game choices .',
       'Agree with other reviews...all they want is you to BUY BUY BUY!! I won $14 BILLION on a jackpot...that\'s HUGE! And yet, no matter what I played, tried small and large bets, I LOST EVERYTHING in a matter of hours!!! That\'s how ridiculous it is! Also contacted support about a glitch and they NEVER fixed it...it just rips you off on free games. Great games...just a total waste of time.',
       'I was playing a tournament u have going for Valentine\'s day. I get to a game where I have 65 million and I won over the 20 million that was a quest. I lost over 100 million trying to get a free game quest. If I want this kind of feeling I can go to a real casino and drop real money there and get the same result.',
       'What a waste of time, had free spins twice but i  all the time never once did I get 6 HEARTS. HOW MEAN CAN YOU BE.If you buy coi s good luck all they want you to do is BUY BUY BUY. Once again why did I bother.  THIS IS THE WORST SITE EVER',
       'I\'m uninstalling due to excessive notifications.  While listening to one song on YouTube, I got 6 notifications each one chiming over my music. No thank you!  Ridiculous',
       'The Most "Indecent"Slot apps  on Google Play. Non stop popup ads..Spin once..lose 60%  Close 3 popups. Spin, win 10% Close 3-4 popups. Contact them? Sure..If you want to give them your Paypal login info..Stay away' ],

     [ 'I think this and most of the game since choices came out are all rip offs of episode choose your story. Now I\'m not saying they are bad apps or stories I just wish some of these people knew about episode. Though I have to admit this game is pretty fun.',
       'Let\'s be honest. This game is very similar to every other choice game. You have to wait 3 hrs for another ticket and I don\'t mind that BUT the storylines are CHEESY! Like damn, I don\'t even feel  the chemistry between the characters, you all should work on that. Also, the why you all draw the Black characters is simply awful. Work on the way you color the lips and draw the face. I hate to say it, but overall, this game is basic. It\'s a work in progress, READ your reviews and actually listen to what they are saying.',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'In the past I loved my shelf, now I kinda like it. Untold Darkness was amazing... Then I read Untold Darkness 2, I was very unhappy about it. I had hoped it was a continuation of the first, but it restarted just like the first. One of the things that got me upset was that it changed things, like not knowing Eugene, and Eddie, also I disliked how I had to meet everyone else again.  I really think there shoud be a continuation of the first Untold Darkness though, it\'s my favorite.',
       'I kinda liked it. I finished untold darkness book 1 before giving up. I also started reading a couple others to be fair. I didn\'t really like untold darkness until later on in the book, and was eager to start the second but very disappointed in the second one. I felt like my choices didn\'t really effect the outcome.',
       'I like this game, but I\'ve tried to get ahold of customer support for free credits not being awarded and have been ignored even with picture proof. Very disappointing, will probably delete if they don\'t fix it.' ],

I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁',
       'Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'So when I first downloaded it I thought it was going to be really good and following to the comments, it is also addictive. The only issue is, it laggs when you get further up the tower. Please fix this issue and if you do, five stars from me! :)',
       'This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous"Candy Crush" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can\'t seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can\'t stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.',

       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',

       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',

Make this game have more tutorials n stop this freezing part for a better game n have  a 5 star rating from me n not a 2 star rating. Do u want a 2 star rating or 5 star rating? Just to be clear, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF U ARE DUMB. Tks😒😒😒',

       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'I love this game! Been just playing on my wife\'s account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won\'t even register me moving. I\'ve tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what\'s going on?',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'The game still doesn\'t work. After the absolute failure at New York, I thought Niantic had learned, but now no one is playing this large download file (I cringe at calling it a game, their is no game-play!) and still the servers don\'t work! I walk outside on a clear day, "location not found". Niantic not as bad as EA or Bungie, but keep not trying, you\'ll get there.' ],

     [ 'The Daily to-do list never updates anymore. This means you could be inadvertently doing all the tasks and ticking all the boxes and still have the task list register as (5/7 completed). It\'s not a matter of being patient because you wake up the next day after having completed 7 tasks and the list resets itself. This is a frustrating bug that makes the game very unrewarding to play, because the to-do list never updates according to completion thus propelling you onto an endless trajectory of "Make the most of today Complete 7 tasks (5/7)\'s" that never come to fruition because of a programming lag that doesn\'t register the seven large green ticks which sit adjacent to the tasks. Please Please Please fix this.',
       'so much fun not like the Sims on PC but still fun',
       'Not exactly the same as the platform versions but bloody good',
       'Great game',
       'Good game, but a few things I want to complain about.  1) The time. It takes five seconds to do this, five seconds to do that. I send someone to talk to someone, and five seconds later I get a big checkmark over their head. Please, for some of them, extend the time. I highly doubt people would watch a movie in five seconds.  2) The needs. Why don\'t they have the need to sleep, the need to eat, urinate, etc? The needs were what made The Sims, The Sims! Please make an update where they have the needs, it makes no sense that they can walk about and do thing for 24 hours without sleeping. And please replace the energy with the needs.   Thank you.',
       'Love the new update,  happy it has more goals to achieve as it was getting a bit boring doing the same thing every day.   The only thing I\'m confused on is the stickers?????  How do you get more,  my daily to do list says I have to give 6 stickers but I have none to give.  How am I suppose to finish my daily to do list every day with out them.  Makes it pointless to do my list as I can\'t get my reward anyway.   Can someone please explain to me how to do these stickers.' ],

     [ 'Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I\'m watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.',
       'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.',
       'Saw it advertised and gave it a go. Pretty fun, once you understand the tactics it\'s pretty easy but I still like it. If you want to waste time, but not on a Candy Crush rip off, this is it!',

       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',

     [ 'GAH! They\'ve over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn\'t even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I\'m sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn\'t want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn\'t change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.',
       'Caution! Needed access to my personal files including photos to play the game.  I denied and could not start the game unless it had access. Uninstalling after this review.  Don\'t let programmers and hackers get a hold of your personal files!',
       'Graphics are good, game play can be lame at times when you get birds that are incapable of completing the level. You can\'t buy the game and that bothers me. I spent $20, (to support the effort) but am trying to keep it at that.  Others have spent $100 and more. Greed ruins this game. Just finished a level that was designed to be beat only by spending money. Spent hours trying but finally paid and beat it. The game play is not consistent. If you have a bad day it will let you win, if you\'re winning, suddenly an opponent that should never be able to beat you, kicks your ass when you\'ve played perfectly.',
       'Gone to -3 Stars, since last update. The game is so hard that u can\'t even win the 2nd round in Arena without using spells!!! (Tower of fortune) is not more than a joke!!! Pig\'s gonna catch u in the very 2nd floor 6/7 times in a week. Hope that rovio think about the loyal players once, not only money!!! Going to uninstall if the bug not removed till next update!!!',
       'This game literally "cheats" as you get stronger. No, not challenging, it cheats. Can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve dropped a bomb or solid rock on a tiny piggies head only for it to roll around and laugh at me. Picking cards and the elevator game are obviously rigged, and I\'ve been kicked out of challenges/arena AFTER winning only to have to start over (most of the time after spending gems and spell cards) I will find another game to spend my time and money on. Thank you very much!',
       'This last update wiped my game progress , i lost all my gems pearls and spells ... needless to say im pretty ticked. I have spent alot of REAL money on the game to get where i was and i highly doubt the developers will make good on their mistakes' ],

     [ 'The stories are addicting and exciting. But you make us watch several ads and THEN ask us to pay for EVERY THING extra. From clothes to hair to what to say next to new chapters. I get the world revolves around money but you are getting paid plenty with these big name ads. Let the game be more enjoyable and make it free or a set price from the start for the app. You lure people in and then ask for money if they want to continue. Nah, I\'ll wait an hour for the ticket. Great game concept though.',
       'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'I\'ve only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn\'t bad. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You\'re able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! However, at the moment, it isn\'t working for me. No matter how many times I try to speed up the clock, it isn\'t budging. It was working 2 hrs ago. So, IDK if there is a daily limit or what, because I didn\'t get a warning. There is something about the videos I don\'t like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!',
       'Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',
       'I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I\'ve used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I\'ve recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The \'free\' diamonds doesn\'t work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn\'t pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn\'t anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these....',
       'So addictive I couldn\'t stop playing it. Only thing I will say is you need to get to many diamonds for the clothes and some of the decisions you have to make. X Is there any more books after Mona series study abroad ? As it did say to be continued' ],

     [ 'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.',
       'Quite addictive and challenging isnt just about solving the puzzle though because requires a certain amount of precision in drawing various shapes that work within the games physics. One mistake and time to restart. Addictive nonetheless and provides some good challenges and perhaps outside the box thinking. Perhaps the drawing tools could be more precise e.g different brush thicknesses? would help but bloody bloody bloody good anyway..' ],

     [ 'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game' ],

I haven\'t played the online battle yet but I absolutely would love to. I can\'t give this app full rating unless they can fix it and I hope they would.  Thanks and good day sirs/madame.',

     [ 'I think this game is 5 stars because it is a exquisite game with lots of fun. It\'s VERY addicting with all the hoops and basketballs. I love the idea and concept of the game. It is nice and easy so any age group could play it. I just got it 3 days ago and so far it is fun. This is one of the games I have had in a long time that was actually really fun, and addictive. I suggest you get this game because it could be your favorite game. I hope if you do get the game you have a wonderful, fun filled time.       😄🏀🎖 Have a great time and get the game!

Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless',

I tried eating a M dragon and my combo time runs out because I can\'t bite him for no reason even when boosting kindly fix that co\'z even with the pet its still happening but all in all great game except for those minor things.',

Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there\'s nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.',
       'A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'I really like this game. But here is why I gave it 2 stars.  I completed all of the challenges but still don\'t have have enough score to finish ranking up.  The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don\'t think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes...',

     [ 'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'Brilliant game play with nice updates. However, certain things can be improved. For example, the gem powered power up is not clear. I am not sure whether the power up works only for one time use or for entire one run. Kindly, help to enlight users on this part.' ],

     [ 'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',
       'Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it\'s a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid' ],

     [ 'I think this is an exceptionally well made game. This truly is a great golf game. Here\'s where it falls flat... I feel as if you must spend money in order to receive all the benefits that the game had to offer.  If you have 8Ball pool, then this will make sense to you. You can still curve your shot, even if you don\'t pay for anything in the game. In this game, however, you cannot adjust the curve at all when you use the basic ball. I feel as if it is closer to "Pay to Win" than other games of similar nature.',
       'This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it\'s pretty awesome!',
       'This game is really starting to piss me off.  Main issue I\'m having is the stupid game freezing and telling me it\'s trying to reconnect in the middle of a game.  I\'ll make a shot then it will continue to count me down and tell me I\'m out of time.  Freezes until my times up. I\'ve lost close to 200k in coins lately and it\'s really starting to piss me off. Also, never consistent. I\'ll make a near identical shot as my opponent and ball travels completely different. Really starting to piss me off. Been playing this game for a LONG time and I\'m about ready to delete it!',
       'It\'s cool but everyone seems to be fairly good so all matches come down to a shoot out. Meh. And in the shootouts your opponent can see ur shot if u go first. Meh. All kinds of perks for FB. I don\'t have FB. Meh. Have to spend $$ to get decent clubs and balls or play this 24/7 and I won\'t do either lol. Nice try tho playdemic. Cheers.',
       'I think most of the time i am actually playing against a computer and and not a real person . And the computer is programmed to make me lose so that i am forced  spend money on the game. The whole idea of gaming online is to have a friendly yet fair platfotn for people to enjoy and unwind.  So you based on the above very brief of the begining of the end fir companies such as yourselves... i would recommend the following simple advise free of charge.....  Safeguarding  the companies reputation is everything.  The future of gaming ,NOT INCLUDING casino/gambling type apps, will be based on trust and have a more family type target market, and thus should have different business models.',
       'Need to have a better way of placing you with an opponent\'s.  All too often do I get placed with some one with clubs a lot higher level than mine, and a lot more trophies. Starting to get old. UPDATE. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY YOU ARE MATCHRD WITH OPPONENT! I CAN NEVER WIN!' ],

     [ 'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'Love this game, its an addictive time killer. But I would like to have replays and not sure if it\'s only my device because I haven\'t seen other reviews about it but it doesn\'t have an accurate count of flips, my friend counted 11 and it said 3.5 I do many more (yes at one time, before landing) and it still says 3, 3.5, 4',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.' ],

     [ 'The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn\'t receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.',
       'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There\'s no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'You "borrowed" a lot from MCOC, but as an avid Tekken player, I think you would have been better served sticking with the PS concept. Play the character you want, play their story for prizes at the end, and so on.  Using MCOC basic controls was cool, but if there is anything to borrow from them completely would have been the controls. Different offensive taps to create different moves, etc. Overall, it is petty solid, but could have been a hit if you stuck to your own game concept.',
       'iFirst of all I would say. It took me almost 30 minutes to just start the game. It was stuck in downloading screen. Later on it crashed on me  I fired up the game again and later It froze on me during the first fight. For 3rd time I started the game and it eternity to just pass through the loading screen. The data was downloading, then initializing and then loading. Took such a long time. Plz fix this issue. I really want to enjoy this game. But not like this. Even the game play is laggy.',
       'The odd bug and very grindy. Still strangely satisfying . Some fun to be had in finding ways to cheese the AI. Good for a quick tekken fix.  Edit: lowered my vote - despite phone on vibrate and game volume turned down it blasted my speakers at full volume. Not acceptable.',
       'Fun game overall, though I wish they would\'ve added more known characters. It feels like they just peppered in a couple of favorites. I am also having an issue where after a fight my progress isn\'t saved, causing me to have less health and I have to do the same fight again. It\'s frustrating to say the least, hence thr three stars...for now.' ],

     [ 'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that\'s what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.',
       'It\'s okay, but now that I think about it, it really takes up your free time and battery, to me it is eh no use but adddictive! If I had a choice to choose between a milla-seccond or a minute, I would choose a milla-seccond but technichly, you could just go offline while you are waiting. Cool game! 3 stars.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'This game is awesome, my tablet lags a lot, but besides that, this is one of the best games in the world!

     [ 'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'The game isn\'t bad if you like word puzzles. My dislike comes from the fact that I have push notifications for this app turned off, but it somehow continues to manage to send them. It also keeps poor track of your coins. Good time killer.',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'This is one of the best word games I have ever, when running into a really tough spot not immediately uninstalled. This is a GREAT AND CHALLENGING GAME!!! It really makes you think and it keeps your brain thinking and actively. I love it and will keep it. I am 70 yrs old and just got this game a couple weeks ago and at almost level 300.. This is a keeper!!' ],

     [ 'I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don\'t mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don\'t have then you should find a different app.',
       'Great app, just too many of the same type "romance" stories over and over again. It feels like only one person is writing stories on here, when It claims to have over 55,000 different stories. Each time i try to search for a new book to read a new, the same twelve pop up over and over. Fix that please. I very much enjoy supporting community made books but it seems like it\'s just a popularity contest on here, with the same story line and plots being used far too much.',
       'I really do like this app so much! I\'ve been using it for years and I have read loads of stories! However, I need to leave a poor review because I recently changed from an Apple phone to and Android phone and I can\'t transfer my data from one phone. I have gems and so many story progresses I need to keep. Please help! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭',
       'I wrote to support but I lost all my progress and my infinite passes I paid $10 for. It won\'t load my profile and keeps trying to give me two tickets. All my stories are not read and when I try to type in my email it said it\'s associated with another account.  Was emailed by support and they said it was fixed. Still isn\'t fixed. Still haven\'t been emailed back since last time. It\'s been three days with the app messing up.',
       'Compared to similar apps like Choices, What\'s Your Story, Chapters Interactive, & Lovestruck, this lacks both genre variety (nothing but romance, no sci-fi, fantasy, superhero, mystery, or horror, unlesd it\'s secondary to romance), & you can\'t chose to play as a guy. This is too limiting.',
       'Hi :( when I open it, it doesn\'t let me in it is getting on my nerves! Don\'t get me wrong this  is my favourite app and if think it is fantastic! But it doesn\'t let me in anymore please fix! See ya and wish you a good day 🌞 ❤💜  Edit: Thanks soooo much for fixing it love youuu 😘 keep up the good work   Edit: Lol thanks' ],

     [ 'I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It\'s simple and I like it! Couldn\'t figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It\'s KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I\'m sure that\'s on your list.',
       'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!',
       'I love this game, i\'ve been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can\'t see or control what I\'m doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.' ],

     [ 'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀',
       'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account',
       'What happened to the game I used to enjoy? Now everything is turning into a spam fest. Strategy has been consistently removed from the game with each update. BH still has a bunch of AI issues. For the first time ever (as a max 11 and misc other accounts) I can honestly say uninstalling has crossed my mind.',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!' ],

     [ 'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool.' ],

     [ 'Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.',
       'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'Amazing!  It\'s very time consuming and very musical, interesting, and you get to play with people from around the world.   One of the reasons it\'s so good is that there are no ads. (That is if you click on something that involves an ad) Amazing 5 STARS ALL TIME' ],

Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that\'s how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Very cool game with good graphics but beware for this game is based around paying to play. The purchases aren\'t cheap either. If you\'re not careful you could find yourself spending hundreds yet still not getting what you need to beat the bosses. So if you\'re into forking up your hard earned cash by all means enjoy.',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',

       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. Hopefully the game will add higher chance and still have the opportunity to get those weapons since its expiring tomorrow.',
       'It\'s very nostalgic to see all the famous characters in a game together and in a game that works. This game is awesome and addicting. I haven\'t spent any money on the game and I can still get stuff done and not get blocked by something stupid to pay for like most games. Grinding is kindve a nightmare for when you unlock later characters you want to use but the writing and gameplay is solid. Love this game and I highly recommend it to any FF fan.',
       'Loved the game from when I downloaded it and played the hell out of it none stop for days pretty much. However, after doing the latest update today, the game has lost all functionality and is unable to even begin. I\'ve attempted to load it several times, and have even uninstalled it and then reinstalled it multiple times but it still won\'t work. Love the game, its one of the best games on the app store but I\'m pretty much furious now that the game just won\'t work for me any more and I\'m not the only one this has happened to.',
       'For a phone game this has been the first one to actually grab me in a really long time. It\'s a great time killer it\'s super addictive and I even find myself stopping to focus on it during some of the harder fights. Everything\'s very rewarding and while I wish that the microtransactions were a lot cheaper all in all it\'s a really good game.',
       ':( I was excited but after downloading was met with a black glitchy screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice no luck. Gonna wait a few days and try again. Not hating on the game at all, just gonna wait a bit.  EDIT: Now that it has been patched it works perfectly, I love this game. Thanks you so much.' ],

     [ 'The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It\'s intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it\'s voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.',
       'I love this game so much, but what about more structures? Also I wish there was a chat in game that you can just type instead of voice chat, also the number one thing I wish you guys could add in or fix is the snipers bc they are weak... also I think there should be a counter somewhere when people dismount the plane so we can Dee how much are still in plane and how much already left  That\'s all',
       'good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members\'re 20 players. sorry for my bad english',
       'Loved this game so much! A tip for dev, You guys might wanna try to block/disable cheaters from the game on the next update though. It\'s starting made this game unjoyable to play anymore. Hope you can see my review, thanks for all the effort you gave to us guys!',
       'Dear GARENA DEV PLEASE DETECT THOSE MOD USER AND BANNED THEM ITS UNFAIR TO US THAT PLAY LEGITIMATELY ON THE BATTLEFIELD WHILE THOSE CHEATERS EASILY TARGETING US... ESP-NO GRASS-NO FOG-AIM BOT... IT WILL MAKE THIS GAME FOR GRANTED IF THIS WILL CONTINUED... bad english',
       'More Update Please.  There\'s a lot of things to repair here. Give more attention to the target pointer, sometimes the avatars body cover the pointer and also the enemies. Give more options on how to communicate easily like putting commands and specially on group battles. Some of vehicles are not functional, like trucks. To be realistic game set-up, all things in the game must be functional, except for those cars like junk. Thank you!!! Salute!!! :)' ],

     [ 'Fantastically fun game! Easy controls are great, super clean graphics are very welcome, and all for the low price of free install!  My only issues against the game are minor. .When you first start playing a round, you automatically start moving. This forces me to start playing without a strategy. .When your trail is cut, I\'ve seen other players survive by touching their base in a quick fashion, but I haven\'t been able to do that.  Overall, a stellar gaming experience, with minor inconveniences.',
       'It\'s a pretty fun game if not repetitive. However, I have found some possible bugs. Firstly, some avatars bar restarts. For example, if it\'s unlock 15 avatars, the bar isn\'y increasing. And I\'m sure I\'ve unlocked more than 15 avatars. Secondly, I recieved the notification that I\'ve achieved more than 100% in a game which should unlock the gold and silver flags(?). This appeared after I had completed challenge 20, however, I haven\'t unlocked these avatars yet.',
       'I like this game a lot.  I beat it once and have gotten to 90%-80% around 4 times. It\'s really competitive and definitely requires focus. However after becoming so good at the game to where I could get to 40-50% in a single run I realized that I was not going against real people, I was against AI that discovery alone completely shattered my experience as I was under the impression I was against actual people. Now there are some real people here and there and you can tell by their name but most of it is AI',
       'This is a very great game! Its so addictive. I have everyone in my family playing it and friends too, they all love it. As soon as you start playing it your hooked. To the makers please think about adding playing with friends and also maybe powers for the different characters you can win one other thing it would be the number 1 game hands down if you could invite your friend into your arena. Please consider thank you for making such a great game though 👍👍👍💯💯💯✔✔🏆',
       'Amazing and almost perfect game but you should add another way of controlling it. Swiping is hard for me and there\'s some .io games that split the screen and makes it to where you tap the left side to turn left, right for right. I like that much better and it would make it a lot more fun for me',
       'Ok. I take back what I said before about this amazing game. And, why do these weird things ( &gt;b&lt; &gt;/b&lt; ) Keep on showing up in my review? Anyways, this game has incredible gameplay. It\'s so much fun!! And multiple characters? I couldn\'t wish for more!!! Thanks creators. And I\'m sorry for what I said for my last review.' ],

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.' ],

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.' ],

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.',
       'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'I have purchased 3 upgrades and the game glitches out and no upgrade when I get logged back in... I am not a very happy customer.. I love this game you can either credit my bank account back,  give me back what I purchased, or better  yet great customer service would do both.. I am asking for some kind of repayment for this inconvince or I will keep my rating low, and I will never purchase anything from your company again! Grrrr' ],

     [ 'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',

     [ 'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'A lot of Numberlink programs have "fake" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard "rules" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn\'t do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.',
       'I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I\'ve had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I\'ve been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.' ],

Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie.

Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it\'s really bad, and it\'s insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.',

     [ 'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite"ZEUS SLOTS". Not fair, I\'m not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is" WILD STARS"  . However, "ZEUS" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.',
       'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!',
       'HORRIBLE. The graphics and slots are cool. But what fun is a game that is almost impossible to win at. I say that because I play 5 different accounts and 3 I haven\'t won anything nice in almost 6 months and 2 it\'s been about 3. Bad luck you keep telling me, I say it\'s all the updates you have done. You guys ruined what was once a fun game. If you looking to have fun and win, look some place else. I\'ve been trying for months to establish a descent chip count, not happening on this game. You say you have no control over players accounts on winning and losing. You say you have no access to accounts, but yet you threaten to block my account. How can you block my account if you have no access to my account' ],

     [ 'I give slotomania to thumbs up. It has awesome  graphics, and lots of different game\'s.  It also has lots of ways to get coins, and special features. I love slotomania  have had this app for many years. I recommend it to all my friends and fellow gamers. Ok I  have spent 100$ in like  24 hours to not go anywhere I\'m going to post the screen shoots. I have been on the quest and no we\'re near  winning yes I love  big wins .',
       'As far as slots games go, this one is one of the worst. Not playable for long periods of time without shelling out money from time to time in order to recoup inevitable losses. This one follows the line of giving you quests to fulfill with sometimes impossible tasks to complete unless of course you pay money to get more coins. Look, if I wanted to pay money to play slots, I\'d go to a casino.',
       'The games are the most fun of all the casinos I have found. The winning is harder than alot but then you go through periods of great wins and then humongous losses. Overall, it\'s worth playing even if you have to wait to accumulate credits for awhile. The new challenges are fun (one is impossible to complete) but still fun. If you like interactive slots... Give it a try.',
       'I\'ve spent money on this stupid game and once u spend real money the game stops hitting. It brings up so called featured ice card on different games n u can spin n spin n spin n no freaking cards at all. N I think if u spend money on this stupid game it should hit something. I only play for fun. But it sucks hurse dick.',
       'This is a awesome app. I play daily. Don\'t miss out on the fun. I just can\'t say enough good things about this app. Customer service is A-1+. Lol, I love these games. Never thought I would be into slots, but I am. Big time! You will be too!',
       'It\'s a great game to play; however if you intend on playing on a regular basis, your going to need to spend some money not large amounts but you can do the 1.99 package once or twice a week. It\'s highly addictive and you will need lots of friends as well. Good luck and spinning.' ],

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes.

So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'I love this game! The cars are some of my favorites. There\'s only a couple things I would like to hopefully see in this game. First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.' ],

     [ 'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'Game does not give enough rewards to play on a daily basis.  It\'s too expensive to play for what you get.  Mostly I didn\'t like it because the,  "earn diamonds," section was bogus!!! I made qualifying purchases to earn diamonds and got nothing. I was pretty disgusted with it after that. I submitted requests,  complaints, went through all the hoops to redeem my rewards and never got them. I would not have spent the money had I known i would Gerry nothing for it.  Do not trust this app to follow through with promised rewards!!!.',
       'Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential',
       'Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don\'t mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉',
       'Im simply addicted to the game and i usually play like 5 times a day and i would\'ve happily gave it a 5 stars if i could vote. I ALWAYS get the error message "there was a problem communicating with the network". I contacted the support team several times but its useless so until i can vote normally i wont be satisfied' ],

And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I\'d love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn\'t block the view of oncoming traffic.',

     [ 'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'Update.  Trying to play again and remember why I uninstalled it.  You have to wait 40 minutes for enough energy to play 20 seconds.  Or, pay outrageous prices for a few minutes of play.  I like the game enough, i would pay a reasonable and higher  one time fee to get rid of ads, and have unlimited play.  I may uninstall, again. Uninstalling.  Like the game but hate waiting hours to play.  Now it\'s crashing',
       'Game is fun until it takes for her to do anything 12hrs to analyze something here spend 2.00 $ to speed it up. Out of energy pay 5$ for an item to fill 20 energy. No thank you. To much emphasis on energy and real money. The cases take way to long to solve and to many starts to analyze something g unimportant and to get stars you need probably 100 energy to get one when u need around 10 or more per case if ur lucky. On a case which coulda been done in one chapter not 2 maybe more',
       'Your usual find hidden objects game, and wait ages or pay to reveal the story fast model. Nothing new here. Tapping on things can be inaccurate as well. Tutorial story was lame. Mini games were totally unchallenging as well, yet we need to earn the right to play them.',
       'It\'s a great game. The only issues are:  1. It takes too long to feed pets.  2. The energy refill should give a certain amount of new energy regardless of where you are at rather than refill up to 110.   3. Since I am on the most current available case, it takes too long waiting for new case to open. 4. Sticker packs are a horrible idea. Should give an option for energy or food.',

I don\'t get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.',

I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx' ],

     [ 'I can\'t stop playing it every spare moment I have available. Absolutely addicting.  Great time waster, but it also helps keep your mind sharp and it might even teach me a few new words too.  Great work!!!',
       'This game is INSANELY addicting! Cures my boredom while also challenging my brain in a way. Everyone I am around enjoys getting in on the game as well! I don\'t think it is too hard with the available hints, and it is definitely not so easy that you are tired of it instantly. Obsessed with this app! Recommended for sure!',
       'I have become addicted to this game! My only suggestion is maybe the creators could update it, so we can earn hint tokens after the player completes each five puzzle set.',
       'It would definitely be 5 stars if the game had a little change. Some people are not the best spellers? If there is an 8/9 letter word for Eg needed would it be possible to leave in the correct letters and highlight the letters that are wrong. Instead of deleting All the letters. You do help by autofiling other letters when a word is completed. Cheers',
       'Just went to play Cody Cross and it has gone from game 120 back to the very start after weeks of playing. Am now going to delete. What a waste of time if you do not get the chance to complete it then what is the point. Very disappointed as this was a good game until someone decided to shaft everyone.',
       'This would be an amazing game if they would only fix the crashes. Crash on startup (often 4 or more times), crash on ads, crash for no reason. If you have the patience to fight thru them, it\'s a really awesome game. I\'d give it a four star, if fixed. Only four because there are so many ads.' ],

     [ 'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 32 and I have 1.092 aa gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ],

And I rate this game a five because how it\'s made, but it can also help you learn we\'re to put the coin to get amazing prizes. This game could be a good practice for people that just like to play these games, you know?',
       'I like this game, but when you do the offers to get the dozer dollars; I never got my dozer $ which help get bonuses. Very bad business. I\'m owed a lot off dozer money! I\'d give 5 stars if they had follow through. I download the games they say complete but there is no one to email a claim to. It\'s a dead end. Very unhappy',

I even sent feed back about this issue and never received a reply. What a rip off! Why have the option if they don\'t honor it?',
       'I\'ve run 2 other apps to get bonus coins both at almost 1k each and I never got my coins. I finished the tutorial like it said I had to but zero coins were given for it. U shouldn\'t offer free coins to run other apps if u aren\'t going to give the coins for it. Will probably give up and delete bc of it.  Tried to give it a 2nd chance and did the flash light purchase to get 2268 coins and never got my coins. Why offer free coins if u won\'t give the free coins?',

     [ 'Well I like the game. It\'s fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don\'t open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.',
       'NejiOmeGa here!🙏 I have got to say this game is a "quick paste first place!" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!🙇 I\'ve loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I\'m a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who\'s Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherz😂😂',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don\'t disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖' ],

There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',
       'Very great game, I can pic some logic questions here and ask it on my friends ang classmates. It really gives me a brain exercise. Wheneve I feel bored, this game takes my bored away',
       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'This brain definitely makes me feel like the front of my head is working. But the constant advertisements between every few levels is very annoying. Especially when a level takes 15 seconds and the ad runs the same length.  Would suggest the paid version if you like it.',
       'the memory mahjong doesn\'t work for me. even after I updated the app, the mahjong pieces do not flip when I\'m supposed to memorize them, they just disappear. and I don\'t want to reinstall the game, bc I don\'t want to lose my progress. I wish you could somehow fix it. thanks' ],

     [ 'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'For as repetitive as it is I can\'t seem to put it down, it\'s seriously addictive. Maybe it\'s the great graphics or the fact it reminds me of one of my old favs arcade game  Spyhunter. A few small things I would fix are; needs a running diamond total during race to see how many you\'ve picked up. A better garage showing a side angle of your car so you can see the paint jobs and rims better and the most needed item is when you click on your profile pick there NEEDS to be a experience total! Just having the circle showing your experience isn\'t enough, I\'d like an actual number total. Also another mode to think about is maybe a side scrolling mode or overhead track mode like Grand Prix 2. All in all great graphics, music and replayability!',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!',
       'One of the later updates has the game stuck in full screen mode, which makes only 4 lanes visible at a time. Music and some sounds effects stop playing after the first song until I start the next race. I honestly wouldn\'t have minded the 4 lanes thing if that\'s how it\'s supposed to be. But I know it\'s not because \'andice is asking me if I really want to exit the game. Good game to waste time with, but the devs gotta fix these quirks.' ],

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.',
       'I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don\'t change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don\'t get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn\'t have done that then I would be impressed by the game.' ],

     [ 'Awesome .game . I like this game . Best game ever of fight and this is game of superheroes fight. So this is the best game . We get champ 4*  and tier 4 cataystal easily . This is cool for upgrade champ. But this game has a one problem. It is very hard to get colourful tier 4 cataystal like red blue , pink etc. So please tell me how i get tier 4 colourful cataystal easily  . And please join a quest in event mode  of tier 4 colourful cataystal by day by day . Like monday =tier 4red cataystal , tuesday = tier 4 green cataystal etc. Please solve my problem of tier 4 colourful cataystal . Please please . This is the best game ever . Thank u . U can search my id in this game .spidy rajat . My team rating is low . I m playing this game about 10 month but still i dont have 2 colourful tier 4 cataystal . Please please . I hope u can solve our problem . Thank u . This is best game ever .and give me a review . Thank u',
       'I love the game and the vast amount of playable characters, however the sound effects overall aren\'t great but the gameplay is very good. One problem I do have however is that there are in models (such as thanos and Kang) but you can\'t play as them. Personally thanos is easily my favorite marvel character and the fact that I can\'t use him is a little upsetting. But overall its a great game with monthly updates and great new characters! Can\'t wait for more!',
       'Used to be my favorite game. Now there are so many bugs and glitches that they refuse to fix... Makes me think that the lag /delay and glitches are intentional. They have been continuous ongoing for years. So they are either intentional or everyone at Kabam is completely incompetent. They try hard to keep the game fresh with new characters and quests but would be so much better to fix the game before adding to it. The game is unplayable most times',
       'Just opened over 40 (premium, 3 star and 4 star) crystals... and got nothing new/useful... f*ing waste!! Extremely huge P.O.S.! Not even worth your time. Rigged P.o.S.!!! Why would anybody put money into this rigged piece of junk?',
       'Hi. Instead of writing a review, I\'d like to suggest a few things. I\'d love to see these changes in game: Please add these characters-  Fantastic Four, MCU Captain America, MCU Winter Soldier, Scarlet Spiderman, Spider woman, Lizard, Apocalypse,x force wolverine, Wasp, Penance, Nova, Quicksilver, Nick Fury, Silver surfer, Doctor Doom, Galactus .            Edit:  1.Change the type of Juggernaut from Mystic to Mutant. Because he is a mutant 2. Add a range mechanics like you did in Transformers Forged to Fight 3. Please buff Superior Iron man and the regular one too. They shouldn\'t be this weak',
       'I Love this Game and had problems with Update V.17.0.2 But after Emails from Kabam they sorted the problem out. Thank you and I appreciate you helping your players. This is the BEST Game for any mobile device and would Recommend it to everyone. It\'s not just a fighter game n has some strategy & Alliances male it even more Fun. Install this game n give it a go, you\'ll Love it 😊' ],

     [ 'Two updates in the last two weeks and STILL no new content. I don\'t know quite what your development team is doing, but it\'s evidently bugger all.   And it\'s a shame, because the game is pretty fun. There\'s some interesting level mechanics that I haven\'t seen before, which is always good. The game is colourful and fun, there just isn\'t much of it.',
       'I\'ve been waiting along time for new levels. I love the game but this is getting ridiculous with how long it\'s taking you graphics team to push out the new levels. I\'m no game developer but you guys should be able to give your players an estimated time frame as to when they will be released.',
       'It\'s a great game to play lots off fun. But the only downfall is that you say update to the latest version  np it\'s updated but no new levels what\'s going on waiting at level 60 to play more. What\'s up',
       'It\'s so cute and I\'m stuck on level 60 and I have to wait for new levels... I hope they can be released fast because this game is so fun and cute... Edit: you guys say coming soon and it\'s been 2 updates... When are these levels coming?!?!',
       'Installed the game two weeks ago & breezed through the levels. It was addictive & love the animals! I would love to give it a 5 star rating but the fact that I completed all levels in less than a week & have been waiting patiently for a week for new levels is unacceptable! I play a lot of these games & have never experienced anything like this! It appears that the game developers did not put any thought into how quickly a player can beat 60 levels or how quickly a player will lose interest when new levels are advertised as "Coming Soon"  & it takes weeks or months! It\'s too bad because it really was a fun game! 😐',
       'This is just unreal. The devopers make a game, release it but don\'t finish it. Stops at level 60 which you can get to in a couple of days easily. Game play was good until I got to the end a couple of weeks ago. Been 1 or 2 updates since but no rest of the game' ],

     [ 'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.' ],

It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'WTH HAS HAPPENED?? Been playing for 3+ years and have NOT EVER seen the game "rolling" system so broken. I have not rolled anything worth a $$@ in almost 3 MONTHS. Don\'t give me the it\'s random thing. I have never had anything like this until after an update a couple months back. You have obviously changed the system and it is apparently to screw the long timers in favor of generating more $$ but it\'s only making long timers like me BORED and frustrated!! I\'m not spending any more money until it\'s fixed. Tired of wasting cash!',
       'I\'ve been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don\'t lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless. Plus it\'s just an incredibly addictive game that you can do well with even if you don\'t spend any money.',

You can advertise all you want but don\'t interrupt any background apps to force me to look at your ad. That\'s just messed up.',

About the ads: I have premium, and I only have to watch an ad if I choose to get a reward in return. There are no sudde, unwanted or random ads anymore.',
       'Far too many ads. And being forced to watch a 30 sec ad before continuing! Sorry, uninstalling. Try banner ads only, and I will play this game for ages. Now you won\'t make any more money out of me. Also, look at the reviews, you obviously haven\'t got a clue about what irritates people.',
       'Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there\'s a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.',
       'This game totally sucks like most of the other reviewers said. Nothing but forced ads with NO reward or compensation for our time and intelligence. And it lacks any originality. It\'s just another stupid boring merger game like the thousands before it. On a fun scale of 1 to 10, this game is a 0 for all the ads and unoriginality. It was a free game, but I want my money and time and intelligence back.',

     [ 'I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it\'s said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they\'re not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.',
       'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God\'s sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn\'t worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.',
       'Ok It said Hey wanna play? Update your game..... Then when I come to update it it said it\'s updated AND IT IS..Pg2d u r bassically restricting me from playing the multiplayer battles. re u serious rn? Icant play cause i have to update the game when i already did.... Bassically waist of my money to buy new weopons when i cant use them.',
       'It\'s a great game.... until you reach level 27, then there is a REDICULOUS difficulty curve. I was steadily climbing the tornament leaderboard, I was good, then I kept getting destroyed after hitting 27 with OP items and no gems to get the new weapons, because I had spent them leveling up my weapons and was out. What are you thinking? Lag, not double jumping, not firing when I need to, occasionally. How rediculous.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!' ],

     [ 'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Some faults Overall a simple yet addictive game. Too many ads. The game ends and instantly an ad appears and your still hitting the screen so you automatically click an ad. I\'m sure advertisers don\'t want to pay for a click that was purely a mistake. Also the leader board has people on 5000 points. I can\'t get past 78 after a lot of playing so I can\'t see 5000 points is scored without a hack.' ],

     [ 'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.',
       'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points' ],

     [ 'Simply wonderful app!! My daughter\'s speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it\'s repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn\'t get enough of it! Now we\'ve moved on to shapes and colours that she\'s working through now at 22months. It\'s truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where \'Z\' sounds out as \'Zed.\'',
       'I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!',
       'Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the "a is for apple" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they\'re learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI',
       'We like the number one and wanted to like this one. However it is super buggy to the point of being unusable.',
       'Omg it is amazing my brother can now sing along in the alphabet he\'s good in his grades!!!',
       'The apps from this company are terrible 2 different phones and my touchscreen doesn\'t work when they load along with gave me adware on both phones to boot.' ],

     [ 'The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can\'t even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.',
       'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..',
       'Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn\'t have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you\'re reading this and you\'re questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! 😉😀☺',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.' ],

     [ 'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',

It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day.

Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.

I really like this game as you can tell but I feel like I have been USED I WILL NEVER PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN IF YOU DON\'T MAKE THIS RIGHT. I will give you 24HR. Then I will be done. 24 then I will be gone',

I am very proud of our Team, TheTwilightZone.                                                             Our Team ended the year with a First Place Finish in League Tournament!!

       'This has been my consistent go-to game for years now. Although I have to admit...the last few new games are the saddest bunch of performers compared to the older standards. Kinda makes me  sad to see the change.',

       'It\'s alright. Been playing for a year or two and always losing coin, never winning much of anything. Payouts could be more. It\'s a great app and a great game.. if only they\'d let you win sometimes.' ],

       'I love the game it is so simple yet super fun. Just the only down side is that there are WAY to many ads. I stared playing a round and then an ad pops up.. Like really. At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:',

       'Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn\'t be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!',
       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..' ],

This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you\'d have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun',

That has happened at the minimum of 10 times to me with every one being a ALL-IN pot. In the MEGA BONUS SPIN don\'t get hopes of winning the MEGA BONUS. Expect the lower scores 100% of time & by all means don\'t spend money on a spin. Look it\'s a good free game for awhile until game determines it\'s time to pay to play. All the "FREE" games are like this so don\'t expect this one to be different.',

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can\'t find Bradinsky song. It\'s okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol',
       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',
       'When I saw that EA took on the game I immediately purchased it thinking it was any good. The graphics are good, but the controls are nerve-wrecking and the game makes decisions for you. It responds slowly and the block hold works by itself. These little things make you lose and make the game unplayable. Don\'t download it - free or not, look for another Tetris because this does no justice to the original',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.',

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'Its good fun but extra world tour levels are needed to sell the full game, both after purcgase and before. But if you delve into the crevices of each mode and extract every bit of play you\'ll find out whether it\'s worth it' ],

     [ 'Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',
       'I urge people to stay as far away as possible from this 1! They are robbing lying cheating scumbags, using illegal and and fraudulent tactics to get money from your bank account in to theirs! Such as offering deals and then not giving you what you have paid for! Investigation underway!',
       'Love the casino games it offers and the league I\'m on.  But huuuge has made changes to the game which makes it harder to get puzzles and always trying to sell chips  lottery tickets just to play constantly and it\'s frustrating other than that I love the game.  Use to be easy to get puzzles and be fun to play it\'s becoming about money for Huuuge always selling or you have to buy something..',
       'Disappointing, Unless you purchase chips.. you can not keep up with the Club event games.  There is no real incentive to continue. IN order to even play you will need to Start with chips over 5 Billion chips.( which you don\'t get) Otherwise you will never even have a fighting chance, as you will be betting low and never gaining.... Or get high.. lose all quick. And then quit.. Or You can Pay out of your pocket.. over and over....',
       'I have played this game for many months I have purchased and yet with all the updates you all do it keeps getting worse the payouts on the slots are horrible. The group event games are picked I think to take all our chips so we will be forced to buy I believe that until you make the payouts on the slots better you are going to lose a lot of customers.',
       'Considering the game is called BILLIONAIRE CASINO, the payouts are too little to support the name.  In the first couple of weeks on starting with the game payouts are great then like all other games you are on a continuous loss to PURCHASE COINS. Happy gaming.' ],

     [ 'This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would\'ve given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the "!!" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don\'t delete when you have progress. I\'ve downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I\'m never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out',
       'Being Honest this game hasnt really been up to date with others competitors. One thing I think would be lovely is a training camp/single player bot practices to do with new heros. Maybe a small revamp to the art style like 5% realism. And to decrease the amount of gold heros cost, really turns down the tone to play more for new heros',
       'Edit from my earlier review.  I re-downloaded this game after giving yall some time to work through some issues Id been having.  Lo and behold... All of my progress is gone. I was a high level with numerous heroes and skins I cant get anymore. Yet when I relog in from my google account and my FB account, it still has me at this new level with none of my stuff. What the heck yall.' ],

Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time I\'m gonna have to download because it won\'t open. Overall, it\'s a fun game when it\'s not glitching',
       'Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they\'d at least be entertaining.',

     [ 'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'It\'s a fine enough game, I mean it\'s solitaire.  However the app refuses to allow Pandora to run in the background unfettered.  I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',
       'Had an old version that was pretty fast and got used to it. This in comparison is kinda slow, like real cards! I will get used to it. Otherwise, really like this solitaire game. Picked it over several others.',

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'I  am still going to keep this game but it definitely need a new update like Flip Master which is way better. On Flip Master you can upgrade your characters  So they are better and have more skill but on here they stay the same. The last time I got the game it was fun but this time the characters are stiff and you can hardly do any flips. Definitely keeping Flip Master as my favourite!  Fun game for people who: Want to mess around Need a game that doesn\'t take to much skill Need a game to to pass five minutes  Everyone who likes this game should definitely get Flip Master because overall it is so much better! Hope my advice helped for future updates',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and' ],

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐' ],

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!',
       'Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can\'t load the game after update clear data and dl again',

       'This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren\'t for the ADS. I get it\'s a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',

The game has 60 levels or so. And to pass them you need to sweat. The explosions, shooting, guns. You can also find spinners and gyro-paceters, which are likely to become invincible.

     [ 'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Gameplay isn\'t disrupted by ads unless you want some free coins once and awhile. They aren\'t throwing the loot boxes in your face either.  The coins per hour/minute seems to be while playing only. Not sure if that\'s a glitch or how it is meant to be.',
       'Overall the game is really fun. A few minor issues like the controls being a little awkward and no way to remove ads, but other that that, a solid time-waster.' ],

BUT may photos temperature started to climb and quickly shot through the roof to a point where it literally burns you! And it kills your battery! For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.',
       'This is a cute little fun game but it keeps crashing I can\'t even open it so therefore that\'s why you got such low reviews. I was having a lot of fun with it until it started crashing. Even uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem. I hope you eventually get it fixed it would be worth downloading again.',

       'Silly pointless battery killing little game, I loved it! The game kinda runs out of puff after level 150 though, as there is nothing else to achieve. I\'ve got all the prestige balls, all the regular balls, all above level 150. Can we have some higher order balls above Thunder please?',
       'Would give this a better review, but there are so many glitches. You can only upgrade a booster once, then you have to close the app and open it again so you can keep upgrading. Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.',
       'Would have give  a great review, however I bought the no ads extra and to my surprise paying the no ads gave me more ADS. So many ads it\'s gotten to the point where this is unplayable. Wish I would have saved my cash because now I feel like I have been scammed.' ],

     [ 'Same old same old game. Same thing we have been doing I. Tons of other games. Where is the originality? I expect more the the Red Alert style remake.',
       'This is an updated comment. I already loved the game just thought it needed better controls. Have to say after the update I gave it a perfect score. It\'s sleek smooth and just all around fun. It\'s very clear they took consumer complaints into consideration and it\'s good to see. Highly recommend if you love GOT and these style of games. Only negative is the farther you advance into the game the more I get the feel of a page of wind kind of situation which is sad but it\'s still worth it.',
       'The game is super sluggish gets very annoying. The rss are way to low and not able to be gotten and when you do farm you get almost nothing total waste of time. There needs to be a system to see where\'re you and your guild ranks in your world.and the basic rss your own keep gives you are way to low for a game of this type 12 hours should not produce only 6k wood at lvl 20',
       'I loved this was up to a level 17 keep level 20 house it was fun i even spent over 200.00 on it then there was a new update. I lost all my work it started me over. Now it doesn\'t play the war room and map do nothing but load i can\'t read messages it really sucks. I submitted a ticket and have heard nothing',
       'Bad people can ruin a good game!!!  One of the worst examples of racism in a PvP environment. I would not recommend this game for any non Caucasian as you will be relentlessly attacked, and told in public chat that you do not belong. I have not seen that much racism openly displayed in a game in a long time. I do not endorse or recommend, especially for those of the afrocentric mindset. I will now openly advocate against anyone playing this game. Terrible!!!',
       'Had issues as of 22/02/18 again. World and War room access constantly loading. Before then, the tool bar on the right flashing and lagging. Since update at 18:00 on 22/02/18 have not been able to log back on. I have submitted tickets about this issue before and the reply via email is that the ticket has been closed. Go to support via website and forum and tired every step and more. No help.' ],

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'This game is both funny as serious it\'s a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'I love it and all that but it should really make some more valentine mini games because it just gets boring after a while and the thing i don\'t like about this app is that every time when you die it just goes onto an advert which are so annoying. Everything else i like and the app is actually quite good and funny aswell',

It hasent changed since when I usted to have it it would be nice to get some new maps or bikes and maybe change the layout of the menu. And maybe even a multipler more where u play with other people/friends and just free ride or challenge to see who can get more points. Other then that it is a crazy fun and addictive game.',

       'Awesome!!!! It\'s an awesome  game.......But(there\'s always a \'but\' coming from me ;-) )......You should work on the reality glitches. Like when you start, in the first levels(the docks)...You move and the bike rolls down but when you move up the next slope it doesnt....You should work on that. One more thing......You should not keep all levels payed. You should keep it like, if you beat a certain record or you finish the course faster than the time given already. Otherwise, HATS OFF TO YOU ILLUSION LABS...GREAT WORK!!!',

There are a lot of twists and turns, funny and interesting interactions and I like how the creator is also involved in the game. What I love most about it is that there\'s a story being told. Even after you lose (and you will lose a lot) the story keeps going forward.  The thing I\'m not that big of a fan of is the micro transactions in this game, there are quite a lot of em, I understand why the creator does this but if all of the money he gets from micro transactions goes directly to this game in order to improve the game I\'m all in.  Good job on the game, creator!',

There are few outright good options, most of them force you to expend a resource in order to obtain another (eg let corporations dump nuclear waste for some extra cash), and sometimes despite your best efforts you get killed by radiation or overthrown by your military.',

When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',

The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',

     [ 'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I\'ve made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new "club wars" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There\'s always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don\'t have to spend real money to play the game, but I\'ll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I\'ve even started a second city on another device with my other email.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'I would of rated this 5 stars if I didnt loose all mt progress I tried logging in to google play but it said sorry mayor this city is linked to another device. This is the same phone I\'ve had it on so im really really ANGRY about it so yeah. Help me get my old city back ELECTRONIC ARTS . My city had over 100,000 population I had the airport Dr vu\'s tower and the port and everything else apart from the building so yea. Im so bummed. HELP ME PLZ',
       'Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it\'s class.' ],

This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.' ],

But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.<br><br>**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** <br>Launch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

After playing for a little while I couldn\'t help but feel like I was waiting for a little bald guy to want to eat me if I got an answer wrong, "cans we eats it precious". Jokes and riddles. Very good game. Well done.',
       'Game is really good specially for kids . Makes them think. Only bad part of this game is the list in answers.. they are already displayed. This makes the game very easy. It would make an awesome game if user had to enter the answers.. hope the developers fix this!',
       'The concept is cool and the riddles are fun but I dislike that it gives you four options to choose from and most of the time, it makes it very obvious what the right answer is. I would love this if it let you type in your answer or give you a section similar to hangman and you can fill in the letters for your guess. That way it actually makes you think and figure out the riddles instead of picking the word you think or know fits best. I also can\'t stand how many ads pop up during a game so simple like this. If they limited the ads and changed the layout and used a different font style I think it would highly imporove the game. But that\'s just my opinion so don\'t let this review stop you from trying it for yourself. I just think a little more time and effort could\'ve gone a long way for this app.',
       'I found "500 Riddles" to be somewhat misleading.  After the first few levels the riddles started to repeat. (Either the exact same riddle or the same riddle worded differently) Also grammar and punctuation errors in the riddles started to get annoying. But overall I did enjoy the program.',
       'The game could use a few fixes. Sometimes when you touch a level it is unresponsive. The stage count is weird. When you completed all stages of a level it says 9/10. Please fix this the overall game isn\'t bad but these are very easy no brainer fixes.',
       'It\'s fun.... But way too many adds. Still love playing it....but it\'s just annoying... Ok so to add to this: im on level 19 now and a LOT of the riddles are repetitive...again, still a good game and good time waster but I\'d prefer new and harder riddles as the levels go up ... Just some advice to the maker of this game!' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'I\'ve been on Township since 2015 and I absolutely love it. Its the first game I play in the morning and the last one I play at night. This game has so much personality. From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I\'ve played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don\'t have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.',
       'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.' ],

       'My absolute all time favorite game! I used to have the woodblock version and would play that one ALL the time. The only thing I didn\'t like about it was that I couldn\'t get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It\'s got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don\'t feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it\'s a good way to get your mind working if you\'re someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒' ],

     [ 'Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven\'t grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it\'d make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there\'s no use for coins.',
       'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing',
       'First off, I\'d like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It\'s amazing.  However, I\'ve been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can\'t pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I\'m on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.',
       'Was really enjoying it until the most recent update. You guys broke the ad version. Now no ads play to get a revive. Disappointing as it was working fine. Why oh why did I say yes to the update? It\'s as if you wanted to force free players to buy the paid version.' ],

     [ 'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'It\'s a really great game! I\'m really looking forward to an update. I think it\'d be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I\'m looking forward to see what you guys do!',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are great😁' ],

(Tiny reward just to rub it in)Currently ranked. 90 & 2 trillion.Hands down the best slots on the play store.But what has stopped me purchasing with real world money are many other player reviews stating they have not received tables or all the chips promised after purchase.As the developer don\'t seem to reply to any reviews or grievances they underestimate the value of customer care & how much value players like myself put on reviews.Enjoy the ride while it lasts for what is a highly polished product but be   prepared to hit a brick wall.Hope I have helped someone',

     [ 'Kind of reminds me of skulls of the Shogun (although I don\'t know which was developed first). Haven\'t played multi player yet bc I\'m going to get schooled! Great game. I love all the different tribes and take no issue with shelling out a few $ to check the all out. Of course playing the free tribes leaves little to be desired if u can\'t afford the extras. Best game I\'ve come across in a WHILE.',
       'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'The game is awesome. The multiplayer portion just got added, and it is very buggy. I tried it on three games already, and there are many instances where i did not get my stars during the game. I\'ve supported the game and have every tribe except the Luxidoor, and I\'m very excited with the new multiplayer gamemode. Midjiwan, pls solve it ASAP!',
       'Guys. Love the game. Play it all the time. However...  When the update was done a week or two ago it is now locking up and shutting down. Not sure what you did but its annoying to get to level 29 of 30 and not be able to finish. For a while I would back out and just restart and it was ok. Now it just locks right back up after restarting.' ],

With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!',

Says "loading cantina" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!',
       'I played this on and off since it started but now I am back full-time and it has always been improving and growing. Big star wars fan and can\'t get enough of it? This is the next best thing. The game is very complex so I suggest if you are only starting out, check out starter guides on youtube on how to have the best head start  and enjoy! 🎉',
       'My game had been freezing after last update. I ended up turning wifi off and using mobile data once it got to the update it asjed if i wanted to switch back to wifi. I did this turned off mobile data and it has worked now. On android hope this helps some other people out',
       'Fun to play  but remember keep up grading thru the gamewith your charaters of all range of types and you will have fun remember the further you go the better your characters will play for you best of luck... be prepared to be flogged alot before you know it you start winning but its all about strategy in your attack as well as your player strength and abilities good luck and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU...',
       'Graphics are good, turn based matches are decent to play.  Not a casual game, you have to be pretty devoted, takes a lot of time to play with so many daily events.  Character packs can be pretty expensive if you want to buy them rather than grind (think £80 for a couple of characters, then the cost to level them, talking hundreds).  All the best characters coming out now are behind a pretty steep pay wall.  If you go on holiday or mover over time zones, the payout times remain the same meaning you either have to play at strange local times or dump your account.  Lots of people have complained but it is just ignored.  Lose a * for that region bug and another for ignoring it.' ],

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ],

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',

Well done guys you certainly deserve my thumbs up',

Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail.

     [ 'Pretty cool game. Like the simple concept of taking something we have all done at one time or another and turning it into a video game.  Genius. I really like the sense of accomplishment I get when I make a trick shot like a bank shot off the boss\'s head and no rim just straight in! It\'s like he shoots he scores! The crowd goes wild! ..fake crowd roar...',
       'The game makes me feel things down in my nether region super fun to play. When I throw the paper ball I\'m like sweeeeeeeeet. I daydream about playing when I\'m at work. The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',
       'After the last update the game sucks so bad. Tons of add, lag, the interface moves poorly, after 5 minutes i just gave up and uninstalled it. Used to be so much fun before. Please go back to the previous versiob!',
       'I had given up on life and was resigned to spending the rest of my days in isolation, a stranger to socialising. Then this game entered my life and has completely transformed me and changed my life forever. Thank you for turning me into a complete and utter tosser.',
       'Golden rule- never fix what\'s not broken. Applies here. Paper Toss 2 a great game & addictive, didn\'t need upgrading to Paper Toss Boss! Also why were my past high scores & achievements not retained? Disappointing.',
       'Wow, this game is fantastic! How have I not downloaded this before?? The controls are easy to use and very responsive. So far I haven\'t run into any bugs so that\'s good. I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!' ],

     [ 'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.',
       'This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it\'s so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can\'t find it 😑... the games the b💣mb. But the update I don\'t have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged' ],

     [ 'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they\'re supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, Mclaren P1, Dodge Challenger, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it.

     [ 'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'Good game. Though it could be better. Make range on weapons and protection when you have armor on. Then you should be able to unlock new settings besides the train. Multiplayer would be cool. Another (and the last) thing you could implement is a way for you to go back and beat the bosses you defeated already to earn money. Despite all the flaws I\'ve stated, it\'s a good game and time killer.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10' ],

     [ 'It\'s the best I found. Not many ads, none flashing. Has the most puzzle choices I found. Easy to see, and can enlarge tile size. Pick any tile choice. Easy to use. Ending game closed fast. Automatic goes to next game. Keep tracks of games played. Play with friends worked good. Only thing I noticed, It scuffles tiles around when no more moves possible. Scuffles 6 out of 10 games, leaving 4 games not scuttled. And didn\'t mess with my cell. Very happy with game app. Have fun!  Martha 😊',
       'It\'s simple learn controls on, you can change the tiles to different styles for easier time or a challenge (try the flags!).  5 modes of difficulty (they added Hard 1, 2 and 3 instead of one Hard recently).  I have it on a WIFI only tablet, only way to avoid ads is airplane mode. I\'d be willing to pay a dollar for my phone version to be ad-free forever.  Ads have gotten a little aggressive lately on a lot of Play Store games.',
       'Game flows nicely. Doesn\'t bog down my phone like some others. I love that the screens actually load. Lol. Nice layout. Tons of boards. Ads are not overwhelming and don\'t interrupt gameplay. Edit: changed phones, and while it kept my achievements, it did not save any of my completed games! Plus i feel like it\'s a little too easy to 3 star every board. I still really like it though.',
       'I love this game. It\'s my go to when I need to do something. My only issue is when playing multiplayer. When the "you lose" comes up, you could be mid-play and end up hitting menu, thus ending the game you\'re playing. Which, is highly annoying, especially if it\'s a good opponent and you basically go back and forth winning. The likelihood of getting that player again really isn\'t that great.',
       'I use to play this on my computer. I love this game. It keeps my ADHD relaxed and keeps my mind busy from what\'s bothering me in my life. This game is great when you need to get away from what is stressing you out. It helps me with stress and anger. Thanks for making this for mobile phones',
       'Game is great! Highly appreciate that commercials are kept out of view and does not need permissions. Just a few things that could make this game greater; could have "move back " option -/ the tile selection could be more vibrant/ next move help option could ad to it. /  If additionally I could tilt the view a little or rotate the board - for sure, this game should be a five star rated.' ],

       'There are far too many ads in game that you have to deal with, and game limitations basically force you to purchase stuff in order to even approach something resembling actual progress. What makes things worse is that there really isn\'t much of an actual game to be played here, just spin once, wait for the ad, spin again, wait for an ad, repeat until you uninstall the game permanently. I\'d only recommend this game to someone looking for an actively painful experience.',
       'The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don\'t waste your time',

I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',

It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Do you know what? This game is really bad. If you\'re calling this game really good, then you must be blind. The graphics are really bad, it is really laggy and whenever someone puts in a review, you don\'t fix it. You never do any updates to impove this game also. And the fact that you have to wait for your hearts to regen is so annoying. You should remove the hearts *now*. That is why I think this game is so bad and that I rate this game 1☆.',
       'I am a football player and I watch alot of football so I know that a shot directed lowly towards the bottom far post must definitely get in. But this game won\'t let you score with that strategy. The keeper dives from one end to another. Ridiculous. And why do I have to repeat goals I have already scored? Pathetic' ],

     [ 'This game is really fun and interesting. But i have a question. Under your character which says tap on me, there were 3 choices in it, although i\'m not sure if those are actually choices. As i try to tap on them, nothing happens. Is that really normal? Or am i suppose to do something? Especially since one of the options there was "meet the lost soul." Please help me out',
       'The game is AMAZING !! I got all three endings already and it was super fun. I just really hope there will be an offline version so I can play it without WiFi, it\'s a good time waster. Also, maybe you can put a feature where if you press the person you are in that life, you can see the stuff they have like the superhero, smart feature, timeshare, etc. , so that it\'s easier to know what our person has. Also, maybe put a description for it? Just a suggestion! Play Nirvana guys it\'s great!!',
       'Hi dev, i sometimes don\'t understand whats the icon under character\'s name means. Can you please put what it means in help sections? or maybe you could make a list about that in game that you could unlock.  That\'s just a suggestion though. I love your game, keep up the good work 👍',
       'One of the best mobile games I\'ve ever played. I love the puns and jokes alongside all the stories you get to create and live through. If this game ever goes out of beta and won\'t be free anymore, I\'ll be happy to pay for it. Keep up the good work, I\'m excited for any further updates.',
       'I really fan of Reings the best strategy and puzzle. This game little bit confused and don\'t understand how up or lower.  Can you make update something little more easily like sign ↑ and ↓ please this game so very interested.   P.s great job',
       'It\'s a great and fun game. I\'ve seen some reviews that want it to have more customization or to be more like another game, but i think the randomness is what makes it so interesting. (I would mind some vague hints for the challenges though, I can\'t even begin to figure out how to become a parent)' ],

     [ 'Good game, please add more customizations, make a custom skin is hard, please make it easier to fill in and please buff sniper rifle, please have a invisible armor button, have hats and that you can create multiple maps. Also, I hate that everybody has auto sight and auto fire on, so that people cant enjoy that much fun because you basically just would get killed instantly just because of people who let the game play for them.',
       'This game is a good game. I gave this game a 5 star rating cuz its sup awesome and also me and my brother play it at school if this had a 10 star rating you know i would give it a 10 star rating and also can you add a minigun and also i hope this game never dies and i hope to remember it when i grow up',

       'The game is pretty fun,but it\'s pushing on the "pay-to-win" aspect which is annoying and I hope it can get resolved so I can enjoy it without being at a disadvantage and being able to afford the gear and cosmetics without having to spend money to afford them.' ],

It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. 😂',
       'Problem I have is that it promotes multiplayer use, but you cannot tell who is an actual player or an AI, there is no chat system like it says, and half of anything it talks about is unavailable in the game. The concept itself is great, the game itself is a great time waster, but I have to call it out on its false advertisement.   Now, if I may have been mistaken, someone please correct me, but so far as I can see there is nothing in the game that suggests multiplayer capabilities.',

     [ 'I like the game but there are a few mistakes in the game . For starters the footsteps don\'t always sound as it should , sometimes I find myself listen to footstep irrelevant to the characters walk. Secondly the combo moves for some characters are a bit broken. For example Berserk, it is very hard to distinguish his  (hit , hit , dash) combo , and when you do,it has a tendency of repeating the dash if you spam the dash button. You can also do this combo in the air if you jump before you dash . Besides those mistakes the game is pretty fun.  P.S. It would be nice if we can crouch in the game so it can make it easier to dodge bullets.',
       'Such a great concept! If you download it now, all features work and controls are nice. The recent update has changed my mind about it\'s improvements; I feel this makes it a better game in that it might not be perfect, but competitive play coming soon and a new leaderboard makes it worth it. Try it out!',
       'Actually i like this game but this game still need improvement. I found that City Hunter\'s dash skill is vurnerable while Swordman\'s dash is  not vurnetable... i mean City Hunter skills is easily damaged by rhino and  dual blade-leg enemy. His tornado is useless against them',
       'Ripped off league of legends and their project symbols, their champ alikeness, and even the name overdrive from the release of 3 of their project skins. Like come on show some originality don\'t rip off someone else',
       'Make the money auto follow you. I hate losing money to spikes. Thanks great game tho',
       'The Game is so Smooth that Its like an Fps Game I really Love so Keep in Proving  do Your best I love the Combo You Guys added! AND more!! And these Game is Best for Offline gaming 2018 Be safe And Be Awesome' ],

     [ 'I\'ve been playing this game for only a total of 10 minutes, but so far, it has been enjoyable. The game delivers on exactly what it presents to be. It is a crisp, clean, smooth running, first person target shooting game. It is simple in design and very easy to play. Touch your screen, drag to aim, align your sight on target, and release to fire. The sound of the rifle firing is very enjoyable, as are the "hit target" sounds, the reward/level up music, and the "successful stage" jingles. If my opinion changes after further examination, I will be certain to edit this review accordingly.',
       'Lots of fun. Simple yet difficult to master. I play everyday. I like the variety of targets. Purchasing option doesnt work. I tried to buy $4.99 of coins in the app. It took my money  but it never added the coins to my score. Google Play credited the amount back to me. Good app overall.',
       'I suppose I need a stylus for this bc using my finger makes it too hard to get the accuracy right... However, it\'s a really fun game. I\'d suggest lowering the amount of drift a little bit. Thanks mobrix for a enjoyable shooting Sim!!!',
       'First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared that the opponent cheated. The time ran out for them to shoot but the game then froze. I was able to change guns, sent emotes, etc. and I was connected to a stable internet connection. I waited 20 minutes until finally sending the game yo the background so I could google if it was a cheat. Low behold I instantly lost all of my coins. Dont waste your time with this game, poorly made and cheaters will take all of your coins in multiplayer.',
       'Uninstalled after 10 mins. Too many pop ups for other games plus the lengthy ads that you can\'t get out of. Great game otherwise.',
       'It is about slowly balancing your gun to release and take the shot within a set time limit but not quite as easy when you actually try. This makes it a challenge to perfect hand eye coordination so that makes for a good game.' ],

     [ 'It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could "ditch the glitch" so to speak. Thanks',
       'So hard to beat the game. I\'m not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can\'t buy anything in shop without real money.',
       'Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win',
       'I raced 500\'s out in some of the real known Desert race\'s until I went off the freeway trying to come home from the Mojave 250 and was in the hospital for a year. Fell asleep behind the wheel, I should of died but I  made it. . . . . .',
       'Good butt the other bilwr seems 2 always have a slightly better bike so very hard fin though plus plz let me buy the last bike now along with the rest thx',
       'This game is one of those that get you coming back. The learning curve is steep, yet not so steep for it to be frustrating. As you become beter you can actually feel yourself doing beter and going faster. This game is the perfect mix between difficult and entertaining. The only reason for the 4/5 is because of the grinding required to get beter bikes at a later stage. Yet it feels more like working towards something rather than grinding endlessly, thanks to the mini rewards along the way. All in all a very fun game' ],

       'Its so super expensive to buy a fucshia tiara, please when i unlock it please reccomend 1999 coins again and my pou so super preety pink and so beautiful. Update: please when i unlock it it must be 999 coins per item and please make it cheaper and please make it more beautiful like adding sparkles in tiaras and make more minigames and specials!

       'It\'s been more than a year that you haven\'t added any mini game in any update. You\'ve written on "What\'s New" section that "We\'re working on something big" but you .haven\'t shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I\'ll rate 5.',
       'I was addicted to the game the first time I played it.  Still love it and have put it on every device I\'ve had since I was first introduced to the game.  Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!',
       'Massive Pou fan, but after a short break from playing I find it fails to respond and crashes a lot- anyone any ideas why? I don\'t want to risk re-installing it in case I lose what I\'ve already got!',
       'I wish you didn\'t have to wait for a long time for a item. Like, for example, if a hat was level 60. Then you have to wait for a long time. Please instead of doing levels. Please just make them expensive. Because you need to wait.' ],

The bonus spin should be changed to give more truly random three digit numbers (with significantly less chance of a 0 in first digit spot) or be reduced to two digits instead of three.',

Not can you figure out the code on drawers in level 11 as the colour shapes are not relevant to anything. I had to go to clue which was disappointinting and still didn\'t follow. Otherwise I would score game higher. A few tweaks would be nice please.',
       'Really impressed with this Escape room! I\'ve tried several others where I don\'t get anywhere, it makes it no fun to play! This one is just hard enough and some easy ones as well that it makes you use your brain & have fun at the same time!!! I\'m basically a beginner and got stumped quite a few times, but eventually figured it out. This is the best escape room app I\'ve played so far! Please make more!',
       'This really got me thinking, I loved the variety in the levels. The only issue is that some levels do have steps that are impossible to figure out as there\'s no connection in the clues. I had to use the videos more than I would\'ve liked. The other issue is that you can\'t save progress so have to start a level from the beginning if you move away from the app.  Overall a really fun game that\'s had a lot of thought put into it.',
       'Well thought out and masterfully crafted. Graphics r pretty cool too. Not a silly seek and find, this is more a.treasure hunt and use your noggin to problem solve. Beyond fun, it is entertaining and you actually feel pretty happy when you figure it out on your own. Stuck? You can watch a video that shows how u can escape and complete the level from start to finish.  Yo u do not have to watch worthless vids to get  any rewards. Creators deserve respect on this game in design, creation, execution with the problems and puzzles you get to solve. Gratifying. Nicely done!',
       'This game deserves my 5 stars!  and I\'m no doctor but this is a perfect brain teaser to help your mind grow. It\'s addictive and for me no matter how hard a level got I NEVER wanted to delete this wonderful app. I now mastered all the levels and now it\'s time for me to delete it.',

     [ 'Rating it 4 stars because of the spin the wheel system which is obviously rigged. I can do the math, the probability of always getting coins and hearts while spinning the wheel for hearts or 10 tickets is 1. I even went as far as reaching the 90 tickets point just to test if I was going to get anything good. Of course, I was right. Coins, some more coins, 50 hearts. I can buy a bunch of coins for that amount of tickets, why would I spin the wheel? Maybe this feature is made for people with gambling tendencies and high tolerance of losing every single time you spin it. I like the game very much tho :D I\'ll keep playing it.',
       'Won\'t lie before I make the review I do wanna let you guys know I dropped like 15 dollars on the game. With that being said I was a huge fan of roller coaster tycoon as a kid so I wanted the best experience possible. Sound and music is great, graphics are fun especially when you start having a bunch of rides and stands going off at the same time. Can\'t go wrong, give it a shot!',
       'Amazing game. Great speed and graphics. The only time I ever had an issue was with my phone being slow and it froze the game when I bought a ride and I lost the coins spent on it when reopened. I contacted atari and they reimbursed me double and had amazing customer service and care for the problem when it wasn\'t even entirely the games fault. I really am pleased with this game. And it is amazing even for a free game. Lots of fun 👍👍',
       'First the game needs permission to store files on external storage. Then once the message comes up to give permission it says grant permission to access files, photos, and media on device. So which is it my device or my external storage? Either way you are not getting access yo my files so you can modify  and delete them. NOPE..GOODBYE UNINSTALLED!!',
       'I loved this app, really addictive. I got to about level 48 but I\'ve just logged in to do the valentines event and im back at level 21!!!!! What the hell!!! This is a gamebreaking bug that needs fixing asap ive lost hours worth of my time here and until its fixed its one star.',
       'Love this game. I play it everyday. I would love if there was a Cost Menu where you can adjust the price for everything, rather than clicking on each individual building cause that takes forever when you have 100% buildings. Would also be great if the decoration percentage categories was Family, Thrill, Coaster, etc. rather than just ride. Sometimes it crashes while starting or freezes while I\'m playing, but closing the app and restarting normally fixes it.' ],

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that\'s over on Friday. Do hope it\'s resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.',
       'Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don\'t play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn\'t bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don\'t waste your time or money on this company.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Good game but you need to fix your ads, half the time they either crash the game or they won\'t load and freeze the game so you have to restart. Also the game will randomly just close sometimes for no reason. Enjoy the game but there are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out.',
       'Game was fun until the Ad time increased from 30 seconds to over 2 minutes. I\'m not going to watch over 2 minutes in Ads (up to 6 consecutive time in a row totaling 12 minutes) just to play the game. Disappointed they made this change.' ],

     [ 'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.',
       'Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it\'s in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'Its a good game but consuming a lot of time because every next opponent is OP and i have to  buy  every new weapons after defeating  one opponent or craft it without which i will be crush down with 2,3 critical hits  and the coins are hard to find plus the energy should be unlimited. So that the game will be more fun',
       'This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling. It requires spending more gold or gems rather than actual skills with over priced weapons and gears. The controls are not sensitive and clunky. Overall. Could have been a great game but greedy developers.' ],

     [ 'This is one of the best flip games I have played in a long time. Love the way they have implemented the physics in the game. It is like flipping the real thing. Every knife has it\'s own style of flipping. The collection is also amazing. Best part you don\'t need to buy gold for knifes. You can earn it. Some of the blades are paid but won\'t mind buying them as it is worth. Amazing job people 👍',
       'Hi! The game is amazing. Simple, yet very addictive. The color scheme is amazing, and the sounds are great. But I do have one little complaint ; Sometimes the "Card" knife doesn\'t stick into the log when it lands on the tip, although it should clearly stick and count as a point. Have a wonderful rest of your day :)',
       'This is a great time-passer (if you finally have some spare time) , good graphics, and mostly good physics.    However, I recently discovered that players are punished via a lock timer for marathoning advertisements to unlock knives... Why?',
       'REALLY FUN AND INTERESTING. i like how there is a very large variety of knives available to get. A few problems : i am not willing 2 pay money for a knife in a game, it glitches and lets me watch infinite vids 4 infinite money, some of the knives are really stupid',
       'A fun and addictive game but there are some issues with the game\'s economy. It\'s all about collecting the different knives but to do that you need a large amount of money which is earned the fastest with the expensive knives (Or just watching ads). The knife you may enjoy the most may only be 1 coin per flip so you feel forced to use another one worth 2 or 3 that you don\'t enjoy as much. I would like to see a system implemented that lets you upgrade a knife to be worth more so you have an incentive to try and use new knives that aren\'t initially worth 3 coins per flip but can be upgraded to be worth 3.',
       'So simple yet so fun!! You can watch ads to earn knives which I love since I\'m not a paying player. Alot of apps limit non payers but not this one. Definitely download it if you\'re thinking about it. Super addicting!' ],

     [ 'After using it for more 2 weeks here is my review;  This is a great time killer and addictive too. Nice collections of tools, items, etc. But when we tried to play using wifi this lagged like anything. Dead slow and we had no fun of playing and competing. The developer may look into this or give us any guidance for smooth 1vs1 play via wifi.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'It lags everytime we use the multiplayer and the developer needs to look on the Bluetooth connection as well. Super lag. :( please update this coz I love this game a lot!  Update:  Wow! Thanks for giving me heads up! I seriously appreciate for looking into this. :) keep up the good work!',
       'Hi,  It\'s been almost one month i am using this game. But there are many problems in this game: 1. game is slow in a multi player mode. 2. Most of the time if you play one on one using wifi or personal hotspot. The game will connect you with yourself only. 3. Most of the time you\'re unable to connect with with your friends only. In a month i connected with my friend thrice only.  I have a screenshot also where you can see that the game is sending a join request to myself only not my friend.',
       'decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.',
       'Amazing badminton game! The game mechanics are perfectly balanced, easy to learn and harder to master. Skill becomes a huge factor when playing against unbalanced opponents. No single play works against everyone challenging you to constantly change up your play style. Just love this game!' ],

The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do.

The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun.

     [ 'What a great game this really is, there isn\'t many RPG\'s you\'ll find like this on the Play Store. I recall playing this 3 years ago and a lot has changed, but still a vital element is missing; multiplayer. I see within the game description that it was promised for 2017 but after downloading and playing I can\'t see any multiplayer feature. Apart from that, it\'s a really well polished game and seems to offer a lot of content and replayability and I really do hope they bring us multiplayer. I also purchased a limited time offer for £0.89 and it offered a lot that\'s for sure!   Runs well on max settings on my Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra on Android 7.0',
       'The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell',
       'Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I\'m playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!',
       'I love this game. It could use some improvement, but there is nothing in the current  version that would warrant less than 5 stars... particularly for an android game. If you loved Diablo; then you will definitely want to play this. And, BTW, you really don\'t need to spend money to play or win this game. But it will help you ALOT if you spend $20. Just wait for one of the special offers that come up. Otherwise, just conserve your gems and DO click the ?-Cubes. It is worth a 30 second add to get 5 gems. And I easily collect around 100 gems per day of play clicking those. Also, DO NOT, waste gems on the large golden treasure chests. You have to pay gems, a lot of gems, to get the treasure and none of them are worth the grossly exorbitant gem fee.',
       'The game is addictive. I was hoping to play it offline all the time but you need and internet connection to upgrade skills and craft its annoying because I don\'t have wifi and I use mobile data. Still it gives me the feels of Diablo all over again.',
       'Really nice graphics for a phone. Smooth frame rate with lighting, nice textures and pretty spell animation. The drawing symbols for spell casting is a really innovative feature, but the auto-attack dumbs it down a bit. Normal difficulty is a little too easy. Nice crafting system, and spell leveling.' ],

     [ 'I\'ve been a fan of this game for many years on the iPad, but it\'s still rather buggy on Android. Contrary to device settings, the puzzle will rotate even if device orientation is locked, making it difficult to play laying down. Rotation also resizes the viewport and controls, and lowers zoom capability when shifting from portrait to landscape and back to portrait.',
       'The puzzles are great.  There has been a problem opening the app though.  I just get a black screen that has "Mobility ware" on it and it stays that way for so long I sometimes just close it.',

       'It\'s one of my favorite games to play, but it\'s very unstable.  Entire puzzle gets larger then smaller by just touching the screen instead of using two fingers, spreading to make larger and the reverse to make smaller. Put your finger on a piece to move it and the whole background moves, and you can\'t move the puzzle pieces. This is very frustrating!',

     [ 'Fastest uninstall ever. 15 seconds of gameplay, then 15 seconds of timed add. Can anyone spot the fake reviews? Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',
       'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout' ],

Funnily enough the option to purchase it again looks like it\'s working. Cannot give any higher than 1 until this glitch which can render your previous purchases void, is fixed.',

I tried restoring purchases and it hasn\'t done anything. I checked my bank and the transaction has been processed and is pending to come out my account meanwhile I have been left with the standard version of the game and am quite disappointed please help?',

       'Not as fun as I thought, but still great game overall. Addictive☺ Funny as well because you can customize your own character and vehicle!(use funny images! I did and i laugh all the time!) 4 stars all the way!😁',
       'After playing this game, I\'ve really enjoyed what it has to offer. The cars are cool, the graphics are fun, and the ragdoll feature is awesome. But it needs so much more. And I have a few badly needed suggestions. First of all, and most of all, a SAVE REPLAY feature and a SCREENSHOT feature. Adding both of these things would improve the game TREMENDOUSLY. Second of all, GRAPHICS OPTIMIZATION. It can get pretty lagged up on some of my favorite levels. And it\'s the same for other people. And last of all, a VR feature. Like for first person camera, there could be VR compatibility. This is not badly needed, but it would be pretty awesome. So, Secret Exit crew, please please PLEASE read this review, and please consider it. These ideas will make the game better.',

There should be a better way to regenerate chips more often especially when they\'re so hard to win while playing. I shouldn\'t have to spend $50-$100 dollars on a cell phone game to be able to play for awhile and enjoy it. As much as I could like this game in it\'s current state it takes the fun and enjoyment out of the game. This game is clearly a cash grab.',

Best games at the price of constant loosing, If you like to win once a month and lose everyday this is the game for you. Could be a great game, I would buy the tokens if I felt I had a chance at winning. I played solstice for two weeks and barley won my bet amount back.

I loved this game a the beginning it was working fine now it does this all the time. It\'s sad that you get hooked on the game then it starts to do this and can\'t even play it right.  Please fix it cause i really love this game and don\'t want to have to delete it.',

Half of times i respawn  i get eaten before even the game starts. And one time i payed the X3 for 1 hour i was ever respawning on viruses . The game is nice but the performance is not nice.',
       '1. Lag is a killer. Even with high speed internet, my character jumps around and pauses. Then,  when it recovers,  i get eaten. Unplayable with the lag.  2. Ads freeze the game. When returning from an ad, i have to quit the game then restart.  3. Game is fun when controls are smooth. Maybe there are too many characters on one board and server has difficulty tracking everyone.' ],

Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯',

I understand why its designed that way but I would like to see a better selection to purchase with chips that aren\'t level locked. Also, provide more ways to get cash and diamonds besides only being able to purchase them.',

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',

How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?',
       'I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can\'t actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don\'t let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it\'s a glitch in the game I\'m not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .' ],

     [ 'This is a very well thought out game and I love the positive comments when I finally figure out the  way I need to go first so that the next shot is easier to get. Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don\'t get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y\'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys\' creativity.',
       'This game was good  but could be better. I wish there was something other than just basketball. Like tennis, football, or something like that. Graphics were good. This game is addicting but it\'s hard to get past level 20 if you don\'t have Facebook. So I\'m stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better',
       'This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can\'t get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don\'t know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun',
       'This game is clearly set up for suckers to pay ridiculous amounts of money to play.   1. Energy bar--- really? 2. Constant ads some of which you have to watch. 3. Want coins? Watch their YouTube videos, get them more views, more money, more endorsements. 4. Don\'t worry, after about $100 you can have everything and probably still have ads. 5. If you can get past all the BS posted above, after about level 35, this game gets so freaking hard that you cannot derive any fun nor entertainment at all.  These guys are entertaining but this game by the devs is clearly set up for money and sucking the entertainment value right out of what could be a fun game.',
       'Sometimes this game can frustrating but you just have to get good at it. I personally love this game and I recommend this game to every one who likes a fun game.A special thanks to dude perfect for the great game and I love your show to,I hope you guys continue it and I\'ll keep watching it.            THANK DUDES.                FROM REILLY.',
       'I love this game and it is awesome. Here\'s some tips characters are expensive and you should have a story mode otherwise it is awesome. Miniclip keep working. I love your your other games like 8 ball pool and basketball stars. Just keep Freakin doin great. You need some work but otherwise great.' ],

     [ 'Hello I\'ve been playing this game for months, so much so that I began to pay to play it. In October of 2017 I had a late payment that resulted in me loosing my VIP status. However; My bank account reflected withdrawals of 9.99 for game plays from October 2017 until January 2018. Google was able to give my money back for January but I have to now contact the Administration of this game in order to be reimbursed for previous months. I love playing this game but I will no longer pay to play anymore.  I will keep you all posted on my outcome.',
       'Decent amount of ads.  I sometimes have an issue where it suddenly stops accepting input. The game doesn\'t freeze, just can\'t do anything. I\'ve tried going to home screen and back and even turning my screen off and back on, nothing works.  Have to force close it. :(  this happens maybe 1 out of every 7 or 8 times I play.  Samsung note 8.   A "live" or else "play with a friend" type of feature would be cool.',
       'The game itself is very amazing in graphics and very creative. BUT as for the VIP membership, it\'s totally absurd that we have to pay $9.99 plus taxes monthly. I would be fine with it if it was $9.99 a year. Hope that this will change some day. I love playing this game. I play this EVERYDAY, even more than any other games. Please consider about changing the membership fee to yearly rather than monthly.',
       'the game does too many resets, all on its own. i can be in the middle of a game, and the game will stop in mid-stream, then start a new game, and causing me to lose not only what i have "won", but will set me all the way back to the bronze box, or, in the case of special games, such as the winter sports 2018, back to the red box, when i actually finished and won the silver medal. the game can be veeerrrrryyyy slooooooooow, and often is. i enjoy the show when i get a chance to watch it, but am not so sure about the game. it would also be nice if there were instructions on how to play the features that are *not* in the tv show...',
       'Loved the real show so decided to try it out  Usually I read reviews before I add games but didn\'t and I should have. Keeps freezing and stopping resulting in me losing when I\'m winning. Don\'t mind the ads so much. Tried the chat no response. Won\'t be keeping this which is sad to say because I actually like it.',
       'It\'s very addictive and a lot of fun to play.  There are way too many pop up ads as others have said.  I\'d like to see one change...in the real game a player can spin continuously until s/he doesn\'t get a letter or lands on an item where they lose their turn.  As it stands your turn is up after you spin or buy a vowel or vice versa.' ],

     [ 'I\'m fed up of this game taking away my energy but not even putting me in a race! And I don\'t even get reimbursed for it! It connects and puts me in a race sometimes but nobody is there.... or sometimes it just glitches before putting me in to the race.......... sort it out. I\'m deleting this bull.',
       'Hard to rate higher than one when it\'s so bugged that you can\'t actually race. Fix the bugs so it becomes playable again. New update just made it worse. Real shame as this is a cool game when it works.',
       'It\'s a cool name. I\'d like it if I could play it. But I run out of energy afternoon racing once. It goes it and either doesn\'t find opponents or it does then freezes and it wasted all my energy every time. Thumbs down',
       'I loved the game but kept taking all my energy and not putting me in a game half the time and how do you get other vehicles it keeps saying unlucking so and so and what\'s the new car unlocks I have to do all over again and again never gives me the car',
       'I enjoy it, I really do but there is not cloud and this is why I uninstalled, because everything I had in beta was erased, so all my money I spent and progress was erased which got me very angry and there was no way to restore my purchase which made me felt ripped off, also this is a big battery consumer, it drains so much battery that I\'m afraid to even play it in public due to how fast my battery waste.',
       'Pros:  - addictive  - fast energy charge  - multiple ways to earn diamonds  - engaging  - almost perfect matchmaking  Cons:  - too many ads  - slight bugs, not worth mentioning here  Overall, this is an addicting game. Various races, rarely-close to never on the same track. The gameplay is close to awesome and the graphics are in tune with the game type. If not for the overwhelming ads, I would have given a 5 (IMO, the ads should have been mostly at the results page after 3 races, not after every race). Matchmaking is done so that everyone has a chance to win.  But, at the end, it\'s not about the ads and not about winning. It\'s all about the race!' ],

The wild witches are really beautiful and fun to play. I am well pleased with Frozen Flame. These slots are the ABSOLUTE BEST OF ANY!!!!  I just had to start over because I had to reset my tablet, but I don\'t mind at all, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!!! I\'m sure loving this game so very much that when I had to uninstall it and reset my phone, I started from the beginning again!!!',

The variety&amount of special bonus games they throw is unlike any game I know. Wicked cool you guys... thanks for the great entertainment for FREE.... I\'m a lifer.',

I  play games daily and​ this game by far is number one!  Thank you so much.  Smiles and lots of kisses',

       'Long story short... I downloaded this app skeptically. Didn\'t like it. Kept it for benefit of doubt. Ended up liking it. I even made a purchase. Then, I had issues with staying connected to FB. Contacted customer support in which the girl JANE just gave me the run around wanting me to say the same thing multiple times! Then, wanted me to resubmit everything I explained for the 3rd time! This rating is a direct rating toward customer support. Couldn\'t even support a pair of "A" cup breasts! And it still sucks!!!',
       'Support sucks and if you look at any of the negative remarks about the support they have the same exact comment for everyone. Do not buy coins from them. Mine we\'re never uploaded spoke with Marina did everything they told me to do to my phone still not fixed and then they tried to tell me that my winnings was the coins I had purchased after I sent them screenshots and ask for a refund they have not responded back to my emails. The game is fun but they are very shady people' ],

       'This game is brilliant!!!!!! The gameplay is magnificent and the power ups are amazing. This really really gets everyone laughing when the players fling out the cars, especially the kids. What you guys could do over there is make a button that randomises the cars that you have. Great game. I would definitely recommend it to a friend',

Today it has a bug, it requires me to click a certain button to continue, a button which is not onscreen. No way to proceed. Contacted WB and was told to file a report. Filed a report and the reply was you will not receive and answer.....well that\'s an unusual approach to customer service. I now have no option but to uninstall.  I could install it again, but really is there any reason to believe it won\'t have more similar issues?',

Its extremely tedious. I do enjoy the scene hunts you basically have to find the objects in the picture, and get points which add up to a star.  It just moves too slowly....',
       'It\'s a good game but having to wait so long for the energy build up takes away the excitement of the game play. Iv noticed alot of other game users have the same outlook on this game. Even the timers for tasks take way to long.. 6 hours to complete? Really? Why so long? People will get bored and find another stimulating game. This is based on the whole wizarding world so it should be alot more magical and less time consuming.',
       'Very entertaining game, but only for brief intervals unless you pay actual money. Your energy supply is drained with every scene you search. Each scene has to be searched multiple times to advance the story, and the energy is slow to replenish, so a lot of waiting is involved after short bursts of game time. Still, quite an enjoyable game for Potter fans and hidden object lovers.',
       'Love the game overall but it takes way too long to build up energy. Because of this you are only able to play for very short periods of time before you have to wait for the energy to build back up. Also some of the \'inspection\' actions take way too long. Waiting 6+ hours for an action to be completed is excessive. I would love to be able to play the game for more than just a couple of minutes a day. I realize it is done to encourage people to make in app purchases, however, perhaps you could provide a paid version of the app to avoid this. I love the game and would love to be able to play it more.',
       'The game has gorgeous graphics. Each scene is very detailed and fun to play. Some are a little difficult to get through if you like to keep your brightness low like me and some items are incredibly tiny to find. But it has a fun premise and it\'s a pretty good time waster. However, you can\'t play for long. Each play takes 20 energy and it goes by quickly. Waiting for it to refill takes a long time. Getting stars to solve cases also takes some time. It\'s basically the wait time in this game that kinda kills it.' ],

     [ 'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',

       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       'I don\'t think it\'s the best game... but it\'s something but..when I colour it it just fills up the hole page. So yeah I don\'t really like it that much and I deleted it when I wrote this so... not a good game but ok' ],

     [ 'This game is really fun, challenging at times & exercises and has a great variety of important brain exercises. My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it\'s the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!😀',
       'Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn\'t deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it\'s to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.',
       'It\'s fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I\'ve failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.',
       'Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!',
       'I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on "memory match" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it\'s worth installing.',
       'Hi, no support team is there, i have a problem- Not able to play Multi tasking game, its hanged - not scrolling after 3rd level, plz help me to play, need to complete tht game, other than this all r gud game to play. Intrsted to play , but no challenging all r very easy to complete the levels' ],

All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',
       'Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up 🤘🏼',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',
       'One of the most glitchy apps. The ads don\'t bother me, if you hate the ads so much pay the money to get rid of them. But this game constantly crashes and freezes. And half the time you will click to change your ball or rings and it won\'t load or do anything. This game is full of glitches. Would be an amazing game if this was attended to',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.' ],

I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',

When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',

This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover.

You have gems/blue diamonds or whatever  the app wants to call them and I have written the support team to ask how I use them, they responded with an answer as to what the purpose and function of the gems are, but not how to use them.  This games is utterly frustrating! Response to Support Team:  I will try the instructions you have provided.  However, they instructions are not clear.  I have not ever been given an option to use gems in a pop up or drop down menu on any game I have unlocked or any game I am currently using.  It sure would be nice to be able to use the gems as I lost 3B $ and need to replenish my winnings.  I bet conservatively and built up those winnings very slowing and carefully and to have lost them all in less than an hour was more than frustrating.',

     [ 'I\'ve never played this game and don\'t really know how but have made it this far and I like it. So update, I\'m addicted to this game. Still a great game, the more I play, the more I enjoy it... Update, they did upgrades to the graphics, thank you. The tiles no longer block my view when paired. The Chinese New Year is a great addition. I think the upgrades made so much of a difference and I\'m impressed by the fact they read what I wrote and like wow, incredible graphics upgrades. Just a big thank you to the designers!!!',
       'Really like the graphics but the times r not long enough to earn anything. Most need to b 30 seconds longer. I know they r so short so people HAVE TO buy in but damn man! EDIT: Seems things are getting better! Thank you for making the game funner to play!',
       'I really like the game except the tiles are way to small and just like now I kept pushing the open tiles and it wouldn\'t work otherwise great game. Since my last date this game has improved beyond anything I thought about. Tiles and graphics, EVERYTHING is awesome now, and what makes it so good to is you guys give enough boosts you don\'t have to spend money on the game to enjoy the game! Thanks for another great game!!! Ok still love it only thing is you should make it not so hard to get 3 🌟 lol',
       'The time limit adds a fun aspect but it would be nice to have a relaxed mode where you aren\'t timed. It also seems a little silly that you don\'t actually have to clear the board all the way to earn 3 stars, but it\'s still really fun.',
       'The app glitches when trying to open sometimes and I\'m not able to play for a day or so.  I cannot transfer the game to my sd card because it will not open at all. Extremely enjoyable and addictive game.  It also helps to keep the mind sharp.  Hours of fun!!',
       'I really love your game. The tiles from Indonesia are diabolical. Also I can\'t figure out how to get  my rewards from the Christmas game and now the Chinese New Year game' ],

     [ 'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I really love this game, but if you don\'t put an update on Clumsy Ninja I\'m going to uninstall this awesome game. In the next update will you please fix the part when you touch the story book then it tells you the pictures are still locked? If you put this in the new update anytime, I will start to love this game like I did before. One more thing.... If this helps.... I really really really love this app!!!',
       'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this' ],

     [ 'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!' ],

You could get decent advertiser\'s I\'m sure of it. Fix the game play, the reels are all over the place.( Short sharp rolls) this could be really good if you made the effort',
       'The sound is all over the shop compared to the real machine. I have received the free spins multiple times and wins are decent. Did not get the Starbucks reward but that does not bother me. No you do not get credit bonus once the credits are gone that is it, however you can Uninstall and then reinstall to get 10k credits again.',

       'What a  bloody joke this game is.Bugger all incentive to install this game.10,000 credits to start, big deal.They don\'t tell you you won\'t get any wins, & once the 10, 000 credits are gone (extremely quickly finished), you get nothing.You have NOCHANCE of FREE SPINS. Don\'t bother installing this game, you will find yourself GREATLY DISAPPOINTED.' ],

     [ 'So far the best, mostly free, slot game yet. I think a dollar for only one scratch ticket is a bit pricey I mean come on. It\'s only a game. This day and age. More for less, brings more, than less. I\'m not paying a real $1.00 for just 1 game coins scratcher. Otherwise far as for fun. Huuuge is the casino\'s and Slot\'s you should be playing. Definitely a boredom killer.',
       'I\'ve seen some pretty bad paywalls in games, it\'s to be expected...but this game takes it to a whole new level. First 10 minutes playing you will win every other spin, enter bonus games every couple of spins, and win win win..then the paywall. The final 100 plus spins netted me about 5 wins that at least broke even and absolutely 0 bonus spins or bonus games. Definitely not going to pay real money for a game that\'s this tight. Don\'t waste your time. Lots of other slot games that are balanced',
       'Good game when it\'s not crashing. Had it crash 6 times in 15 minutes. Huge payouts during bonus spins. Sitting on 85 Billion that I can spend due to stability issues. Fix this and I will rate the game higher. Playing on Galaxy S 8+.',
       'Game crashes and loses progress when it does. Was in a bonus and had 8+billion coins and it crashed with 4 spins left and when I reloaded the game seconds later, only had the coins I had after my spin that triggered the bonus. Garbage. Don\'t buy coins in this game.',

It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',

       'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!' ],

       'The only improvements I would like to see is making it easier to view on my phone.  I actually got reading glasses just for this,  but it\'s still killing my eyes.  If I could even zoom in a little more,  maybe. Also, I\'m a cheapo, so missing out on Facebook & other perks by not paying or not connecting.  I want to play, not embroil myself in social media.  Still, LOVE this game!!',
       'This game is amazing! Most games of this style sacrifice story for the sake of puzzles, or vice versa, but this is a perfect balance and blend of both. I was hooked from the first moment, and the briliant and individual characters and challenging - but not impossible - puzzles have kept me eagerly impatient to play more. (My only complaint is that the energy refill feels SO SLOW when all I want to do is play more!)',

       'I was really enjoying the game, it\'s fun. Don\'t get me wrong. But I\'ve signed in every day, every single day and I make sure I do, and sometimes I do it from my iPad and sometimes I do it from my phone. And sometimes it lags and says I missed a day before it fixes. But today I signed in and it told me I missed a day. So I tried it on my phone and it still said I missed a day so I had to restart from the first day in the current collection item. I\'m very frustrated and upset by this. So this whole \'signing on from a different device\' thing is glitchy af and my game got messed up because of it. Very upsetting. Otherwise it would be a 5star.',

     [ 'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance.

       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ],

However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.',
       'You can\'t do anything to get out of not having food but  buy it with you real money.  Not exchange options or games or spins or videos even you just can\'t do anything. This not fun. You can\'t collect the food even if you grow it. Since I did have enough gems wood or food to build the warehouse I\'m screwed with no options  but to quit the game. Sucks it could have been good. I\'m done. It\'s sad that with all the bad reviews you don\'t choose to change any of those features to improve the quality and keep more users to continue play.',
       'I like the game, it helps pass time. My only complaint is you make it super hard to do anything without having tonso3ns real money. Which is ridiculous. I get that you need to make money off of this, but don\'t be so ridiculous about it.',
       'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective. I will be deleting now at level 6',
       'Such a great and fun game but you can\'t do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.',
       'I really enjoy thie game especially the archipelago tasks. The quests on my island are pointless and so hard to do though. It took ke about a week to save up 1000 coins to give to the mumumba guy.  This is really a long time to earn money. Its a little better now with the adverts as you can skip times and earn coins watching videos.' ],

For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',

YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA',
       'Buyer beware, I purchased the "unlock all manicures" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',

I was hoping you would be able to use the money acquired in the game, but for most stuff you need "gold". Take a long time to aquire gold unless you buy it. I\'m almost done the second region and I think I\'m losing interest. I love to hunt so I was excited about this game but it definitely could be A LOT better. Hope there\'s updates to make getting weapons easier',
       'Awesome game but. It should have that animation effect which shows you the parts of guns while upgrading them. It was so cool in that previous version. In previous version Whenever we upgrade it feels like we are really purchasing the gun\'s accessories. Game is great but as a user almost all will mis this thing... If u wnt to improve ur game than this comment is worth a million for you..  so just go for the fix bro. Best wishes' ],

     [ 'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'Most realistic wolf sim I have found out there, with the ability to get a mate, have cubs and your own den in which you can invite players into. There are also multiplayer game servers and an ability to create your own public or private game. You can also play as a wolf, fox or lynx and customize eyes, pelts and add masks/hats and scars/clothing. Its just AMAZING! Also saying that you don\'t have to pay to play and in-game currency is easy to get.',
       'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don\'t think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you\'ve made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD' ],

It seems to hog the cpu which gets warm on each device I\'ve played it on. Anyone else have this problem?  When exiting the game I have to go to the device settings and clear the ram to stop the battery draining and the cpu getting hot. Seems to crash a lot too!',
       'Slightly better after latest updates but still not as enjoyable to play as it was before the major update last year. Glitchy, slow to start and to play. Constantly disconnects from network and having to log back in to facebook all the time is annoying. Can be a real chore to play. Might try and persuade my regular opponents to switch to another version. Jan 2018 update - EA, I\'m a balding 46 year old man - why are you constantly showing me ads for Pantene?',
       'Possibly the worst app I have ever used. Memory hungry, battery draining - the phone actually gets hot! - and you are held to ransom by endless boring repetitive ads, or you pay through the nose to avoid them. But it\'s Scrabble, a great game, so what can you do? You learn to ignore the ads.    Too many silly words are allowed these days, so it\'s easier to play, but it remains a great game despite the shortcomings of this due app. But there are far too many adverts.',
       'Would be 5 stars if I could lose the ads I can deal with ads you can shut off... Having to watch a video is ridiculous. Rather pay a fiver for the app than watch a gin advert 50 times Oh and why is pilates not in the dictionary? It\'s in Collins online?',
       'Overall, I would not download this game for the following reasons.  Firstly, how come so many words are not recognized? Seriously, June is not a valid word, so are there only 11 months in the year then? However, words like upta do!   Secondly, this app drains battery life as though is using your phone to power a planet. You need to invest in your own power station, if you want to play this game for 10 -15 min sessions.  Thirdly, even for a free app there are too many adverts. I actually forgot I was playing a game and was about to open a bag of popcorn for the feature movie to begin.  Will be uninstalling now.',
       'Forget the ads, the app is very annoying. Its is plagued with connectivity issues. Ads loads first (at the bottom) before your pending Scrabble games is updated...and that is IF the game lists updates without resulting in network error. Often, it will need repeated restarts to update the list or starting a new random online game to force it.  I cannot recommend this app to first timers because it is frustrating. The Scrabble game cannot be enjoyed as EVERYTHING must be online...even Solo play. Look elsewhere until issues are addressed.' ],

       'Cute to see yall deleted my last review. Re writing and giving you 1 star.  Game crashes constantly. . Can no longer get into.  No more money will be spent till fixed. And if my review is removed again. I will just uninstall',
       'I unfortunately spent some money to buy gems for this game but realized that each levels requires insane amounts of gems to unlock new levels and upgrades. Would not be playing any longer. It\'s designed to suck out as much $$$ they can get from you. I\'d recommend you get other apps and just skip out on this one.',
       'I love this game. But when I go into the free gem section and complete an offer it doesn\'t give me my gems. It took me 2 days to get to level 8 on a game because that is what the offer said. I still have not received any gems. I\'ve also done quite a few others and no gems from those either.',
       'This is such a great game, it\'s just unfortunate that you need gems to play most of the game. I used 100,000 coins to try to get gems, and I received no gems. This is a serious issue. You will lose players if you don\'t make gems more accessible to players.',
       'It\'s a pretty entertaining game. BUT you have to buy EVERYTHING with gems (aka real money). Programmers focus excessively on making players pay even before they are hooked to the game!!! After getting to the second street zone, I find myself unable to continue unless I pay. I find it a little lame after all the effort you put on creating a pretty good game. Bye' ],

     [ 'Hasn\'t even been 10 seconds into the game before it shut down 🤣 - I thought it would be different for me as I have the S8+. Obviously NOT. The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn\'t much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.',
       'It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.',
       'One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don\'t really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...',
       'Very awesome game!!! You should add creative for levels!!! Which of course you can create Your own levels!!! That would make the game VERY AWESOME for me and Other players!!! Yea I know there is ads but if people don\'t like them, then they will have to buy the Remove Ads Product.',
       'It\'s hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I\'ll be doing fine but it\'ll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I\'d love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks.',
       'People... There are little mistakes that every game has. There is sucky parts of this game such as ads between every time that you die but the concept of the game is to not die so I kinda guess it gives you a goal. This is an awesome game but it won\'t work for every device. There are some BAD comments that may discourage you but trust me my friends... Try it.. It doesn\'t work, there is always the uninstall button for you.' ],

This way your progress won\'t be lost. If you face further issues reach us by e-mail.Do I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop?No. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. Only if you opt for the secondary game, called "black mode", you may need to pay a coffee for it after level 100.I don\'t feel the game is challenging. Why?The challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now.

Smooth transitions throughout and brilliant graphic quality . 2 down sides .  1: a lot more adverts than what I would have liked .  2: a small glitch happens when I complete a connection puzzle two of the components will flash white for a split second before transitioning into the next puzzle. This glitch is very minor and doesn\'t effect the gameplay .',
       'I seldom rate apps, but this one is special since I really love this app. By simply taping on the screen, you can connect and disconnect the circles. It is so interesting. For those who have not downloaded it, don\'t hesitate to download it! Although I gave a five star review, there are some tiny issues. The app is actually larger than it says in READ MORE. Ads pop up frequently.  You can try to disconnect with wifi or data, then no more ads will show up. You can also mute the music, if you don\'t like it.',
       'I never write reviews, but, here goes-  The decription of the game iss perfectly fitting. "Simple, Relaxing & Endless". Quite addicting for me. Great way to pass time. It is an easy game but you still need to do this and that to finally solve the level. This makes the game more interesting and not too easy & boring. Love it ♡♡',
       'I dont usually write review for game app... but this is, too good. Its simple, but challenging. Ive been playing until #124 for 2-3 days when I was waiting or tense. The music and sound effect is so calming. I realize it has dark mode, though its kind of boring lol. But the actual game; its strangely fun, beautiful animation, no long loading time, no crappy startup screen or tutorial and doesn\'t consume much space, I enjoyed it and might as well keep it forever. 👍👍👍',
       'Outstanding in every way. Smooth animations, nice variation of level difficulty and colors, just really nice presentation overall. Even has cloud saving to keep progress consistent across all your devices. Great to have for waiting rooms and long lines. For this type of game, this is the one you want!',
       'Great game. I play all the time. The ads don\'t bother me as much as I usually play offline. Grafics are nice and i like the smooth transitions of each movement. Also addictive. Can\'t stop. Will the level\'s ever end? 700 and still no sign of reaching the end of the game.' ],

     [ 'The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn\'t cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can\'t pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game',
       'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'Too many ads. Devs are getting greedy with how many ads they put in, I got 3 before I even got to play. Don\'t bother with this junk.',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.',
       'Good for killing a bit of time.  Too many adverts and the sequence of colours appearing make levels impossible without playing lots of times. Used all the gained coins buying 20 extra balls for 1 level and still only had balls of a colour I couldn\'t hit... Ice balls make current level close to impossible. Just swapping where ice is without removing anything dozens of tries and not got even close to finishing.' ],

Now I know that my game account hasn\'t been deactivated, I just can\'t access it and I would love to keep all my progress',

I reset my first phone to factory default knowing that my Pocket Mortys data was saved, I re-install the game and my data is apparently lost. I complete the game one more time and I get a new phone, I re-install the game again and my data is gone AGAIN! I have spent nearly a year playing the game twice. I wish Adult Swim Games would put a little more effort into help fixing my issue.',

Better not get a call while you\'re trying to fight a wild Morty...  ...the game is fun, but unpolished. The instances they put you in often are filled with poor sports who quit when you start winning, and don\'t suffer a penalty for it.  At no point should I be allowed to be challenges by a player with a Morty 20 levels higher than mine.  Get it, but don\'t expect to be able to get immersed in the gameplay.',

You absolutely ruined it with this massive locking mechanism on items and with items being used in turn.

Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',

Will will not get a bingo with a 2x power up playing in legendary boost. The company knows, this was brought to their attention. They resolved it by blocking everyone from commenting on their FB page who publicly spoke out about the rigging. Do not buy credits, do not get sucked into this game. You will regret it.',

     [ 'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'The game is great. It has awsome graphic depending on your setting. It run really smoothly but i think u should add voice chat when playing in duos because my friend always die because i dont know if there is enemy near him so if there was voice chat i could talk with him tell him if there is enemys nearby',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.',
       'I love this game but a few problems 1 don\'t drive cars in this game i was driving a car and just died out of no were and the cause of death was getting run over by a car. 2 sometimes the lag gets real bad and some players have a massive advantage over others and that makes it a bit unfair if these problems are fixed i would rate 5 ⛤',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.' ],

     [ 'Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it\'s just my phone. Also I\'m not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)',
       'I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the "mine" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it\'s nicely done!',
       'I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.',
       'Overall the app is really great. It\'s the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you\'re not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.',
       'Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I\'d prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I\'m using a stylus too so I know it\'s not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.',

It is  also the most generous option to gain coins. I think the adds blocking colors some reviews mention must depend on your device. I play on 8 in samsung tablet and have no problems. I  have two requests. Would like to play in landscape mode and would like the  ability to turn off the highlighting of the selected color like Cross Stitch world for a little extra challange.',
       'This is my favourite cross stitch game of them all. I love the spin the wheel feature where you can earn bonuses such as gold, protect, etc. I actually don\'t mind the ads as they offset paying actual money for the patterns if you are a bit "broke" at the time and the import feature is great! Totally addicted.',

I just wish the spin would land on things other than 60 coins, unpick and shield. There was a day where I got 5 prizes every spin! That was AWESOME!!!',
       'I love this app. It is very calming and fun BUT there are soooooo many ads. I will raise the rating when you stop having me click/watch so many ads.  Update: there seems to be MORE "+80 coins" ads that block out areas to work in so I eventually HAVE to watch them to get them to go away.',
