     [ 'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'Fun game, addactive, enjoyable. However forcing ads on the player after ever 2 hits is out of order. You already let us double our winnings by watching ads so why make us watch them when we don\'t want to? Take that out and add in an option to watch an ad for coins. Do that and I\'ll happily give you 5 stars.',
       'Awesome game. Bought it. Beat it real fast. Would like to see more bats to discover, different levels, places to hit the ball, maybe more challenging fun ways to hit the ball, but at the same time not complicate it too much. I\'ll keep it and wait for updates! Also yes the ads are excessive if you don\'t buy premium.',
       'This game seems like it could be a great time waster... If it weren\'t for the whole crashing after every round when it tries to load an ad or when you try to watch an ad to upgrade something for free. I see nothing wrong with having these ads here.... As long as they don\'t affect app stability',
       'To everyone complaining about the ads, quit being so cheap and give the $2.49 to buy the game and remove them. Once the ads are removed, it\'s addictive and fun to keep getting the ball further. Fun concept and well executed. I\'ve already gotten more than my $2.49 worth of fun out of this game, and continue to play it.',
       'One star for the fact that after every single at bat they throw an ad at you. And half you can not skip early. I understand the need for ad\'s but Jesus Christ not after every turn. I normally pay to turn ads off but since the developers wanted to go ad crazy I\'m not paying a cent and just delete.' ],

Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'The game sucks it\'s alwful. It\'s gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!',
       'This skill-based time waster would be better without the hyper-agressive advertising. First you have the constant banner ad at the bottom of the screen. That\'s forgiveable because it\'s out of the way and doesn\'t really affect gameplay. It\'s the fail-state adevertisements that constantly interrupt retrys that will irritate even the most casual of gamers.   The only people writing good reviews for this game are bot accounts.',
       'Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'The game was amazing! There was only 1 problem. Sometimes when i  started a game in the middle of it, it would just show an ad and it would make me lose. Unless you fix this my rating will be 4 stars. Fix this and the rate will be 5 stars' ],

     [ 'I really enjoyed it up until I got to like level 118. The only way I could figure out the pass that level was to use the things at the bottom of the screen or the things the page where you choose what you want to put in there in advance. But if you don\'t buy extra coins then you can\'t either had moves or get anything that will help you along. Not to mention that 100 coins per item is a lot of money. When you charge $2 450 coins. I\'m taking this game off my apps.',

       'Don\'t waste your time playing this game.  I got too 300 + levels but you get 100 coins for completing each level.  Unfortunately it goes in a piggy bank, which you need to pay to break starting from £1.99, then next piggy bank was £4.99.  It\'s a con!',
       'Just New so I don\'t know what to say yet. Let me play for some time then I can give my view on this.',
       'Awesome and addicting game! Just annoying when you need specific colours and it randomises with irrelevant ones then you lose all your moves like that.  And also, 100 coins just to get 5 lives again ? It\'s way too much especially when we only recieve 10-15 coins from bonus boxes which you barely even get. And you charge too much to buy coins.. the lives take so long to reload. 20 mins is a lot of time especially when the levels are tricky it uses up your lives.  Don\'t get me started with the piggy bank. We should be able to keep that money. What\'s the use of passing a level then. Just to earn like pointless stars that are only useful when you have 20 of them which take forever to earn.' ],

It is nice and easy so any age group could play it. I just got it 3 days ago and so far it is fun. This is one of the games I have had in a long time that was actually really fun, and addictive. I suggest you get this game because it could be your favorite game. I hope if you do get the game you have a wonderful, fun filled time.       😄🏀🎖 Have a great time and get the game!

And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!',
       'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',

We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More.

     [ 'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'I can\'t do normal Sudoku as it\'s too hard. I really like this though, where I can change numbers easily & get hints. I like the highlighted errors. In time I might switch off this function & not use the hints, but it is helping me at the moment to get better... The game still requires a lot of thought. I\'ve been a bit hooked...',
       'Great game for keeping your mind active and gives me something to do on my phone.  If there was a way to get rid of the adds then it would be even better.  I wouldn\'t expect a free game to be advert free; but I would like a feature to remove them even if I have to pay.',
       'It\'s great love the daily challenges. Placing the numbers isn\'t intuitive for me, I like to select the number I want to work on then place it down so I often overwrite my number when I accidently attempt this. Even still its honestly the best sudoku app that I\'ve used',
       'I\'m a total noob at Sudoku, but I love all the settings you can turn on and off, like making notes so you can brainstorm multiple numbers that could fit in a given box or the highlight a row/column/box or the feature that will show conflicting numbers in red. Definitely helping me learn the ropes.',

That and even when you have your tower entirely balanced, one block, which should fit perfectly, falls and somehow displaces itself and screws up your whole game.',

The game only worked once, and it was pretty fun, but the challenges don\'t work either. Improve the loading (I have great wifi) and make sure the challenges work, then I will redownload.',
       'Great game but too many ads, one after every level or loss and most are 30 seconds long and the same few over and over again. Really annoying, to the point of unplayable. I don\'t mind watching ads but it was too much. Plus it\'s really unstable, like no laws on physics, it\'ll get wobbley even if you do it perfectly balanced.',

       'Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can\'t figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy',

The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??',

     [ 'I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON\'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn\'t take long it\'s a simple engine.',
       'Like others here,  I paid the $2.99 to remove the ads and it did nothing. I contacted Voodoo for a fix. No response. I contacted Google play for a refund and attached my receipt. No response. This is at best fraud and at worst simply theft. I am contemplating a class action lawsuit. Small refunds and payouts per person but at least these thieves won\'t get to keep the money. Contact me if you\'re interested.',
       'I love this game however I paid fur the app to get rid of the ads yet I still have to suffer through them even after paying. I\'d love to give a higher rating but being forced to watch an ad after every restart, it makes me not want to play. Please fix this!',
       'Terrible game. I can\'t pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.',
       'I liked the game a lot but I paid to get the ads off and im still getting just as many ads its really annoying and unsatisfying that you pay for something and don\'t get anything at all. I would recommend it if tbwy would take my ads off since I paid for it',

     [ 'The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn\'t receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.',
       'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There\'s no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!',
       'its frustrating on the pvp. you get disconnected and automatically lose. and sometimes they put you against someone who has better ships and level. they need to make it even and offer each player the same ships and same power ups at the same time. sometimes I get no power ups until round 3 and my opponent is already on level 7 because he gets better ships and power ups.' ],

Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco\'s in my silo then tell me they can\'t refund it because I\'m a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!',
       'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'They seemed to have fixed the below issue so I enjoy playing again! Not a bad game at all.  Well I loved Hayday but can\'t play it as it won\'t download the update. I have over 500MB of space available yet apparently that isn\'t enough for this 40something MB  game. Tried support but there\'s no one to actually ask and none of their stock questions cover it.  So now I won\'t be able to play again as it won\'t let me play without updating! Completely rubbish.',
       'It is an amazing game. Our entire family is hooked and i love the idea of neighbourhood chat on hay day it is awesome!!! Continue making this game as cool as it is👍.

At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:',

Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',

This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',

But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',

Rather than that it is game is very addicting and a fun game.

       'Most intrusive ads ever. The game is great. Fun way to kill time. But the ads are horrible. It will sometimes open my browser to some sketchy foreign site, which then opens pop-ups saying that my phone has viruses and I need to download this so and so app. Really ruins the game.',

I got past the faxt it did that almost every game and couldnt make it past 1 lol. Due to the contonuous problem though, i dont feel i got the enjoyment i shpuld have and have since uninstalled the app. Great work so far, i hope to install it again when its able to run smoothly! Thanks!',
       'Cute and funny, the music is catchy and its a nice touch to make its pitch and tone change when you change sizes. the gameplay is simply and yet the timing makes things challenging. The art style is awesome, i am  reminded of early era nick toons IE Ren and Stimpy, or Rocko\'s modern life. All and all its pretty awesome. The only improvement i would make is a option to pay for removing ads. But hey awesome game. EDIT/UPDATE just noticed that there is the no ads option if you buy the starter pack.' ],

     [ 'I love the way the game works, there is a nice progression curve and the mechanics are quite unique. There are only two minor changes I would request of the dev.  - move the health bar of creatures below them, so that we can actually see them (now they are covered with numbers) - as you make progress trough the game, getting a new weapon is more a bane then a boon... it takes way too long to upgrade them to be on par with your current weapons. I would recommend either remove the delay between upgrade and failures (so that you can spam the upgrade button). Or once you own a weapon that is 2 upgrade ahead of the weapon you want to upgrade, you get the ability to upgrade the weapon instantly for the same materials, and an average of gold costs.',

The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling.

It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',

     [ 'I\'m a big fan of rhythm games and I absolutely love this game. The only problem that I have is the online battle. When I found a match and the game is downloading the dog data,  whenever it\'s halfway from finishing it always says "you have been out of the room". I haven\'t played the online battle yet but I absolutely would love to. I can\'t give this app full rating unless they can fix it and I hope they would.  Thanks and good day sirs/madame.',
       'I think I should make this game my favourite game and I could make the best high score of 2000. And thank you so so so so much.But I saw one mistake you were making that was if a player just tap a white tile you would make it out . So don\'t make the player out. Give it at least 5 chances. So that he can make his or her best high score. Please try to make it more interesting . And also when we reach higher you make it faster and faster. Otherwise this game is the best of all games.',
       'I like this game. But the problem is that whenever I lose, ads start to show up and that\'s not good. Also, whenever I start the game I don\'t have any diamonds left, when I  get notifications saying "your lives are refilled". But they aren\'t. So I think you should make some changes in the game. Need Improvement!',
       'Why do you insist on showing gardenscape ads its gotten that bad i actually hate the game now cos you keep pushing it. Thats just put me off the whole game completely and I havent even played it yet! Sucks big time',
       'This is fun when you need a Break/ or when you are bored. It is really fun and it might have a lot of ads to you but to me it is way worth it tho me. You need to get this game now. It is like nip other there is no better than this. It\'d is good for all ages.you have to get this game.it is the best there is. I play it all the time. From 1 to 100 I pick 99.9 all the time. You will not get bird of it. I stay up at night just to play this. That is because it is so fun.you can play it on any device to any device. Is you have a tablet or computer or phone or maybe even a TV if you have a quote if you could get that since the best and if you can\'t get it you should get it it\'s free I mean free this good of a game that\'s free which is amazing.that is way you should get this app.get it now why you she\'ll can. "And bye the way I did not make this game and I do not know people that made it but I wish i did!',

     [ 'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!' ],

     [ 'It\'s getting frustrating.. I\'m into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can\'t manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it\'s rigged. What\'s up with that??',
       'Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.',

     [ 'Solid mahjong solitaire.   Lots of boards, and daily puzzles to play.  A little heavy on the ads if you want to play days in the month you\'ve already passed.  And ads in between each lvl.  You can pay 2 bucks to remove the ads, but isn\'t necessarily going to make the experience better.  The ads are short, for the most part, but still can get annoying if you\'ve played 10 puzzles in a row.  And considering you can complete a puzzle under or around the 2 min mark, those ads add up.  Worth a dl if you enjoy this type of game.',

     [ 'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that\'s just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)',
       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'I love this game! Been just playing on my wife\'s account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won\'t even register me moving. I\'ve tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what\'s going on?',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.' ],

I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',

     [ 'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there\'s an ad, some you can\'t skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don\'t even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed',
       'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I\'m pretty sure that if some one who is religious see\'s that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.' ],

     [ 'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       'Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!',
       'DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don\'t think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT',
       'I was over the moon when they put Mysteries of the past on. I hope they can do the same with The conspiracy as well. All 4 games are a must have. You\'ll never find another game like these. I love playing them because they\'re brilliant & addictive, I hope they continue to make more.' ],

     [ 'I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn\'t be a issue if it didn\'t take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.',
       '**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.',
       'Alright, so I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like this one is deserved. The games concept is great, as with most post-apocalyptic zombie games, surviving and building a base is the main goal. Great. However, it is a micro-transaction based game, meaning you have to pay for packages if you actually want to enjoy it to the fullest. Am I saying you can t enjoy it otherwise? No, I do and I don\'t pay for the packages, however, my house constantly gets destroyed, I\'m killed by other players who do pay, and my game progression is massively slow. So, I don\'t really recommend this game, if you actually want to "play" the game.',
       'Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don\'t make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it\'s an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?',
       'Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you.',
       'I\'ve been playing this Game for Almost 3 months. Very Addictive tho. New update is Awesome. Im Level 90 now but i don\'t have a Gas Tank yet Because I have a Problem about Bunker Alfa Power Error. It says Device need more power. I hope i Can do Bunker even my Device is Weak. Thats why i rate it 4/5 if This issue fix Im gonna Love it 😊 5/5.' ],

It was a free game, but I want my money and time and intelligence back.',

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       'Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It\'s also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3' ],

     [ 'Great game, no build waiting times, lots of strategy, a mix of tower defense and rts. Really is a game with a lot of effort put into it from non greedy devs. Well created hiker games. One small point that a future update could sort out is making a feature to create the same bandits again. Rather than manually going in and picking them again. And if you have spares, to automatically put them in place. Also duplicates seem to have no purpose as of yet....',
       'At first I got a clash of clan type vibe due to some mechanic like throphies and graphics. But the game is widely different and in a fresh new way. It\'s basically tower defense where you play both the defender and attacker roles which is done very well.',
       'Love mini games, also building tokens to obtain chests... please keep updates coming! And would love to zoom in more but I dig the overall quality of the game... when can I use my convoy to attack towns and castles?!?! Later on in the game?? Thanks!! And I would buy more gems if the price was reduced... fyi',
       'It was a really great game at first. It\'s a good strategy game like clash of clans where you try to beat 100% of an enemy\'s troops and vice versa where you gotta try to build up your troops (cavalry) so they don\'t take your trophies.  However, it is really difficult to get gold and the game really tempts you to buy game packs or in game currency. Most players in the game are really leveled up too, so it\'s really difficult to move up...  It\'s an addicting game, but I stopped playing because I know I was going to end up blowing my money on it eventually. You will too as soon as you get hooked on it, so just beware.',
       'Seriously... The recent update... Seriously, a major disaster! MAJOR BATTERY CONSUMPTION! My battery drained like craaaaaazy while playing on the new updated version! Please oh please fix it.. I\'ll be giving you a full 5 ✨ for fixing this issue. Playing on Huawei P10 Plus by the way..',
       'This game is  great and is very addictive. The gameplay is smooth and battles are amazing. The only problem that I face is that it never matches me with people with same power in ambush mode.Most of the convoys are always powerful than me. Please do something on this issue' ],

       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark "Xxx" and I\'ll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍',

       'Everything was perfect for a month or two until one day I hop onto the app to find my high score reset to 0, all my progress on the challenge levels gone, and a few of my unlocked basketballs disappeared.',
       'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

     [ 'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',

You actually can play without paying, you can watch ads to get tickets for example, I have 200 tickets even tho I haven\'t paid a cent. The only thing that I don\'t get is the new content community, it would\'ve been great if we\'d gotten some clarification on that, but oh well.',
       'USA! USA! far to many questions that are about the USA for the jobs. Please improve your question bank. I\'ll even help out if you want. Part from that the game is OK passes the time and learn a few new things along the way. I now know alot of US ambassadors.',
       'Seems like a okay game. But every time I downloaded and installed it I had nothing but problems with my phone, Samsung Galaxy s5. I know the developers will say their game is not capable of causing problems with phone, but I tested it several times and it always came back to this game being the problem. But for the time I was able to use the game, it did seem like an okay game.',

     [ 'I like the game, and it\'s addictive, but the mechanics are absolutely flawed. There have been tons of instances where the game has unfairly screwed me or other player\'s over. 1. Places mystery boxes in front of the player who drives second, but not the first player. 2. Hills like to stop a ball, that is being shot full force by an iron club, in it\'s tracks. 3. The swinging spike balls only affect some players golf balls, but not others.  Things like this piss people off, because they expect the game to be fair. Those small things easily aid a player in losing a match.',
       'Game cheats, puts you against lower lol players with better equipment who make ungodly shots, or much higher level where you don\'t have a chance. I hit things that aren\'t there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.',
       'This is the most addicting mini golf game available! I don\'t use the term "addicting" very lightly when it comes to gaming since I\'m so picky when it comes to games and with the attention span of a mosquito, ha, its hard for me to stick to the same one for very long but I\'ve stuck with this for awhile. It takes every day play to progress up to higher levels and get your upgrades in but it can be done over time without paying a cent....thanks for an awesome game!!!',
       'Where to begin with this garbage game. The game designers aren\'t sure whether gems or strokes should win the hole. Oh..out of bounds shots don\'t incur penalties, which is idiotic. Also, pairings vary wildly in an unfair manner. You could have someone with 500 more exp. than you..hardly fair. Also, the opponent might have a tail wind of 4mph, but your shot moments later has a headwind. Again, poor conception and unfair. Just avoid this game. The inconsistency is bewildering and having an opponent win the hole even though they hit out of bounds is stupid.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun and very addictive. Controls are fiddly; can\'t take a full swing when zoomed out and you can\'t rotate the screen to see where you are aiming. Fix this and you have a near perfect game.',
       'Enjoyable time waster. Good fun. Only real gripe is when your pull back comes off the back of the screen and fires the ball straight away. You soon remember to move the screen before you pull back.' ],

     [ 'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!

       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'Best game ever☺☺☺☺☺ only thing is when will you guus add a new level to the game? Ive played all the other levels like 590 times so please add a level. By the way please reply to this because im really excited to talk to you guys 😀😃😉😎keep up the work' ],

     [ 'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are \'rolling points\' that I haven\'t figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different \'skins\' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I\'m having fun. Maybe you can too.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',
       'I love this game and I just start playing and I already have the iron ball!how cool is that!..........but there is ad after I pass every levels.If you can please fix this thing! :)',
       'This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game.',

     [ 'I think this is an exceptionally well made game. This truly is a great golf game. Here\'s where it falls flat... I feel as if you must spend money in order to receive all the benefits that the game had to offer.  If you have 8Ball pool, then this will make sense to you. You can still curve your shot, even if you don\'t pay for anything in the game. In this game, however, you cannot adjust the curve at all when you use the basic ball. I feel as if it is closer to "Pay to Win" than other games of similar nature.',
       'This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it\'s pretty awesome!',
       'Stop changing the winf its getting boring now !!  I mastered the wind only for ypu to make it not work in in some games or even make the wind twice as strong as the value stated. You should be matched on games played not trophies. Otherwise the good players who go up the trophies quickly always play people with better clubs. The game goes easy on you if you\'re not good at it which defeats the point of getting good',
       'This game is really starting to piss me off.  Main issue I\'m having is the stupid game freezing and telling me it\'s trying to reconnect in the middle of a game.  I\'ll make a shot then it will continue to count me down and tell me I\'m out of time.  Freezes until my times up. I\'ve lost close to 200k in coins lately and it\'s really starting to piss me off. Also, never consistent. I\'ll make a near identical shot as my opponent and ball travels completely different. Really starting to piss me off. Been playing this game for a LONG time and I\'m about ready to delete it!',
       'It\'s cool but everyone seems to be fairly good so all matches come down to a shoot out. Meh. And in the shootouts your opponent can see ur shot if u go first. Meh. All kinds of perks for FB. I don\'t have FB. Meh. Have to spend $$ to get decent clubs and balls or play this 24/7 and I won\'t do either lol. Nice try tho playdemic. Cheers.',
       'Just downgraded from a 3.  I just played a game were the other  player hit the ball out of bounds and wasn\'t given a penalty, then hit a miracle shot from over 100 yards away to beat  me.  I immediately uninstalled after that.  Was a decent game but the devs need to make some major changes.' ],

     [ 'I enjoy the game greatly. It\'s slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I\'m not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game',
       'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'Well done with stealing the boxes idea from clash royale wow you didn\'t even Change the opening times, I think the next thing you should do is offering legendary and epic chests with legendary and epic cars. I have loved the first part of this game it was funny and doesn\'t make any pressure on you, the second one should be blocked from play store, shame on you..',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝',
       'If you don\'t want to give away free stuff from the chests, don\'t. But stop wasting my damn giving me these "free" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.' ],

I love all the different tribes and take no issue with shelling out a few $ to check the all out. Of course playing the free tribes leaves little to be desired if u can\'t afford the extras. Best game I\'ve come across in a WHILE.',
       'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'Guys. Love the game. Play it all the time. However...  When the update was done a week or two ago it is now locking up and shutting down. Not sure what you did but its annoying to get to level 29 of 30 and not be able to finish. For a while I would back out and just restart and it was ok. Now it just locks right back up after restarting.',
       'I love this game hence the 5 star. But the multiplayer needs some work, if I wanna play a game with a friend in 1 sitting I have to reload the map each turn. If the turns could progress without reloading the game that would be awesome. Also, I had a bug that made me replay a turn a few times in multiplayer for some reason after I returned to the game.' ],

I\'m high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.',
       'I love the game.  The thing is, this game just gets boring.  For example,  all you can do right now is to vanquish invasions. That\'s basically it. The portal is not always open.  The tournament? Well the match ups are way too oblivious.  My in game friends already have started quitting coz of these problems. You have to add something fun soon. Well it is still a fun game tho.',
       'Been playing since early access relese. Game is very well built. But like all other games. The ads now bugged. The daily quest for the ad has never worked for me. Starts ad restarts app no credit. Oh well its an ad right. Well now your forcing me to watch them. Please fix So can i atleast finish those 2 daily quest?!?!?!  Also since update my androids menu buttons overlay all buttons on far right/left hand of screen depending on tilt. Phone is an LG stylo 3. Please address and i will rerate later.',
       'Everything is pay to play. The constant need for microtransactions is absurd. $10-$20 at a time. If you don\'t pay, you have to wait days to upgrade resources. If you want to compete, no matter how much you level, you are just under supplied to win, unless you my for resources. Game play is awesome, but setup is garbage.',
       'After Update I reset my device. The Google Play error isnt showing up anymore. Also I can now play for a few minutes but it still Crashes, UGH so irritating cause its very fun. I missed the chance to earn a ton of cool items during the 2 events since the game keeps Crashing. Middle of battle, Crash. Changing equipment, Crash. Scouting opponent, Crash. Editing rooms, Crash. Basically I can only get a couple of minutes of play before it Crashes. It doesnt matter what Im doing, I know its gonna Crash at any moment. Otherwise its pretty addicting with a lot of quests to keep you interested and wanting more. Can get it bit hectic though, with so much going on at once. Kinda wish the main Campaign was a game in itself. I would def buy an App like that!',

Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'I love this game.  The only home design game there is. Glad that that they have added items to the shelves more realistic.  Sometimes I feel it is over designed.  I wouldn\'t always add that footstool or bench.  It is also difficult to play without spending money and I cannot afford to do that.  Keys are required to decorate properly (plants, decor) and can take a long time to accumulate.  This is my favourite game though and I will continue to play and patiently wait just do my best with what I have.  I do watch the videos to gain more keys but woe is me...',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.',
       'This game is have potential, don\'t ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What\'s the point of "playing" in this game?',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.' ],

     [ 'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones' ],

     [ 'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',

       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',

     [ 'Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.',
       'Need some updates like 2 simultaneously upgrade option. Less but more extensive research. Lengthy process is boring. I know by spending money u can get rid of it but money making shouldn\'t be always a concern.',
       'Could be a five star game, but needs improvement. Screen zoom is totally non-existant. No zoom out, constant "finger scrolling " required. ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT!!!!!   ALSO 1.5 UPDATE?  GREAT JOB GUYS!  YOU FORGOT TO POST THE UPDATE!!!    WHAT A JOKE  They are currently giving APPLE users the 1.5 game upgrade. And gave Android user the middle finger. APPLE users now have a clear advantage over Android users.   So dont talk aboit you vare about customers… they don\'t . Clearly an APPLE culture designer.  Still haven\'t posted Android tablet update to ver 1.5 (droid haters)',
       'I really like the game at first. I gave it 5 stars but after a few weeks, i change to 3 stars only. Every time after the update, i cannot play the game. It always "connection problem. please reconnect" and until now i cannot play the game anymore. This game only wants your money.',
       'This a pay to win game with lootboxes of different packs. They will keep making you spend with micro transaction of useless stuff to get the real thing you seek. Once, they took my money and the item was not delivered to me because i asked refund before, for a pack called "hope gemstones pack" but after 3 times of 20 bucks purchases, i did not get a single hope gemstone. A scam game in a very good way to steal your money. On the other hand, the game is very addictive and well made. If only the developer has a bit of decency..',

     [ 'With an easy guide, on \'How to play\'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an \'A☆\' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.',
       'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!' ],

Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'I hated it. Just freezes my phone n have to buy a new one  for 4954  dollars. Its just stupid n u really need more tutorial. Make this game have more tutorials n stop this freezing part for a better game n have  a 5 star rating from me n not a 2 star rating. Do u want a 2 star rating or 5 star rating? Just to be clear, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF U ARE DUMB. Tks😒😒😒',
       'Love the game can\'t seem to put it down. Great time passes while you\'re waiting for your washing to dry at the laundromat, beats watching it spin around. Not happy with all the adds popping up after every game and sometimes in the middle of a game.' ],

Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it\'s really bad, and it\'s insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.',

     [ 'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'A lot of Numberlink programs have "fake" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard "rules" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn\'t do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I\'ve been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.',
       'Edit: New horrible LOUD advertising you can\'t stop. Very disturbing to others and prevents usage around others.   Great puzzle games, lots of levels from easy to very hard. However it will eat your battery like there is no tomorrow. If your phone is plugged in, it will overheat. Use for more than about 15 minutes and your phone will burn your hand and shut down.' ],

     [ 'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',

So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.',
       '2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove "pay to open" boxes or they don\'t go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low.',
       'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.' ],

     [ 'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'It\'s a really great game! I\'m really looking forward to an update. I think it\'d be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I\'m looking forward to see what you guys do!',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are great😁' ],

From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I\'ve played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don\'t have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.',

And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.' ],

     [ 'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ],

I just wish there was a difficulty setting so you start off with easier games and then it could get harder as it progresses, because at the moment I can\'t pass 70% of the levels without using hints.',
       'They made me misspell Rabbids, including "games" like Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan, and had obscure art that gave really bad visualization of very simple things. Just play a better trivia game. Moreover. Don\'t give us awful games like Unity, Watch Dogs, and League of Legends. Anime is anime. Video games are video games. Video game adaptations of anime are still, at there core, anime. Leave those out of these kinds of apps.',

       'Well... The game is pretty good and deserves at least close to 5 stars, but some of the games are really hard to guess and you can easily get stuck when you just can\'t guess any more games. At that point the game just turns out to be boring and you quit playing it.' ],

IT\'S RIDICULOUS. The fact that you cant shoot through the fences makes it so others can use them as coves while u move to them and get killed',

       'Update: This is another update.  Seems like they fixed all the issues I had problems with. People shooting to the wall and the Bluetooth headphone option and not being able to hear anyting. I moved there rating from 1 to 4 stars because they are actively developing this game and seem to care about players. I need one star off because the Bluetooth sound doesn\'t sync up with the game actions. If they tweak that I\'ll have no issues with the game. Keep up the good work.',

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.' ],

     [ 'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there\'s nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.',
       'A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'It gives me something to do on my off time and. As I play I start to get very addicted to the point that I\'m fully in the game and I really love playing this game. I at least play up to 30 to 40 minutes a day just because how intense it is. Keep up the good work!!! 👍',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.' ],

     [ 'Well I like the game. It\'s fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don\'t open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.',
       'NejiOmeGa here!🙏 I have got to say this game is a "quick paste first place!" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!🙇 I\'ve loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I\'m a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who\'s Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherz😂😂',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don\'t disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖' ],

     [ 'I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it\'s said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they\'re not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.',
       'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God\'s sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn\'t worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.',
       'This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.',
       'It\'s a great game.... until you reach level 27, then there is a REDICULOUS difficulty curve. I was steadily climbing the tornament leaderboard, I was good, then I kept getting destroyed after hitting 27 with OP items and no gems to get the new weapons, because I had spent them leveling up my weapons and was out. What are you thinking? Lag, not double jumping, not firing when I need to, occasionally. How rediculous.',
       'Pretty fun game at first. That is until you go up against super duper P2W players. Yes you can pretty much grind out everything you want and get more powerul. But to get fully upgraded everything it would take someone a good year or so playing everyday. It\'s absolutely not fun when you go up against another player that has the best equipment and just running around the map executing everyone while completely ignoring all damage coming at them.' ],

     [ 'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'Game is good without any aproblem it do works. It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I thought the levels would be more difficult by now I\'m on 143 at the moment. I enjoy the game but I\'m getting a bit bored with the easiest of challenges and without having to use the help button . I hope the game will  get more challenging soon.   Grandson aged 5 will like playing this game.',
       'I like that you don\'t have to pay for the Assistance or no stuff on the game to help you advance like the Hammers the ball that matches any color different stuff like that you just got to watch the ads which is fine with me at least it doesn\'t cost you a fortune to play I like the color on the graphics are very bright and colorful and good for children to play no violent content to it whatsoever great game for everyone across the board' ],

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can\'t upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.' ],

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ],

     [ 'This games accuracy is worse than my atari 2600 and is 1000 times worse than my 5200. It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless',
       'Came for Sonic, stayed for a good game. I suggest adding new ways to use coins, like for different variations of pacman or the ghosts. The only complaint i have is the loading time is quite slow',
       'Fun game, except in some games it gets too sensitive and I seem to lose control of the pacman. Other times it gets stuck in one place. It can be frustrating at times.',
       'It\'s everything anyone would want in a classic Pac-Man game! With just enough new features like daily rewards and missions to be modern, while also having all the original things too!!',
       'I am really surprised. The amount of new mazes I\'ve never seen before just blows me away. Of course you can just play the classic version thats why I downloaded it but wow love this game. And you don\'t have to spend money unless you want to its very kick back. Adds of course but whats a dollar to you?',
       'I love this game 💗 But has 4 problems: 1.Sometimes doesn\'t exit 😡 When i do touch the phone\'s back button, Doesn\'t appears the exit game\'s window 😡 2.DAILY GIFT, doesn\'t appears on time 😡 3.In the TOURNAMENTS play again with TOKENS, Without the question takes tokens & Starts play again & It for without button smartphones is too bad 😡😡😡😡😡 4.After turn off the display, The game is getting mute 😡😡😡 Please solve these problems soon, Thank You!' ],

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',
       'Super fun and addicting, the beginning levels are pretty easy but they get to be rather challenging after a while!  The only thing I don\'t like is the frequency of the ads.  Game itself is great though.',
       'Poor controls, continuous adverts, and blocky poorly created graphics.  This is one of the worst versions of this type of game I have played, there are other better versions out there.',
       'Good game.  Wish I could purchase ad- free version.  Deleted! I turn volume off for a reason, but then volume is forced in ads, which makes turning volume off option pointless.',
       'Very addicting game. I find it both relaxing and frustrating. That is only because I choose not to move on until I get all three stars. Oh but how satisfying when I do. I very highly recommend this game.' ],

     [ 'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I\'m from Michigan,we\'re both married ,but there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!!

     [ 'This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.',
       'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       '16 energy to move to the nearest forest!! Don\'t expect to build your house or collect resources in a day. This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',
       'As I have not heard of this game (it showed up in my recommendations), I would like to say that this game is beautiful! I do recommend other people to play it. The graphics are highly amazing and basic control is outstanding! I love the idea on how you can pick up items that you put down and rearrange your base the way you want it. Although, I did have several connection issues, but overall everything is in tiptop condition. Keep up the good work!',
       'Quite the gem. Kinda surprising to find a ftp title with actual depth on mobile but so far it\'s great. Looking forward to more updates on the future. Also, to those complaining about energy costs to move to other zones, that\'s only to run there as you can travel (albeit slower) for free of you choose. Not to mention you can speed up this process through crafting later on.',
       'This game\'s great, I loved it until I saw the ammount of energy it costs to travel to the nearest forest. Could you try and fix this and anything else that the reviewer asked? The game\'s even better than Last Day on Earth, it\'s like a zombie survival in the middle ages, just make some improvements and this\'ll be the best survival game in Play Store' ],

     [ 'This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don\'t have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I\'m having issues getting into the game. It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people\'s choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player',
       'The game is obviously inspired by counter strike. The problem is that the thing that makes counter strike so great is how skill based it is. C-ops is on mobile and mobile doesn\'t have the best and most reliable controls which leaves a lot to luck. Therefore i think that the game should strafe away from being a counter strike clone, and try to be it\'s own thing. It also pushes micro transactions quite a bit with the skin system and MAKING YOU PAY TO CHANGE YOUR NAME! The graphics are pretty much the most realistic it can get on mobile while having acceptable frame rates. Overall not the best fps on mobile, but definitely not the worst.',
       'The best game I have ever play Is critical ops it is perfect at gameplay control comfortable and of course there graphics.But there is a problem today I have try to open cops when I come at loading and came in the menu it shows authenticating but after a sec it again comes back again j try to happens the same so plz fix it am a pro at this game and I don\'t want restart the game so PLZ FIXXX!!

     [ 'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don\'t waste it here. Good luck!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!' ],

     [ 'Loved the game for the first few minutes as it is very simple and interesting. BUT may photos temperature started to climb and quickly shot through the roof to a point where it literally burns you! And it kills your battery! For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.',
       'This is a cute little fun game but it keeps crashing I can\'t even open it so therefore that\'s why you got such low reviews. I was having a lot of fun with it until it started crashing. Even uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem. I hope you eventually get it fixed it would be worth downloading again.',
       'Looks BORING at first. But I can\'t put it down now. And to those complaining about the adds, spam the back button after they start. The only adds this doesn\'t work for are the ones with the fast forward button in the top left',
       'Silly pointless battery killing little game, I loved it! The game kinda runs out of puff after level 150 though, as there is nothing else to achieve. I\'ve got all the prestige balls, all the regular balls, all above level 150. Can we have some higher order balls above Thunder please?',
       'Would give this a better review, but there are so many glitches. You can only upgrade a booster once, then you have to close the app and open it again so you can keep upgrading. Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.',
       'The first thing that happens when you open the game is collect what you\'ve earned while you\'re away. And whether or not I pick the X2 option I have to wait through a 30 second add. Every. Time. Whoever decided to force adds at every collection is costing the developer a lot of money.' ],

Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.' ],

     [ 'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'The stories are addicting and exciting. But you make us watch several ads and THEN ask us to pay for EVERY THING extra. From clothes to hair to what to say next to new chapters. I get the world revolves around money but you are getting paid plenty with these big name ads. Let the game be more enjoyable and make it free or a set price from the start for the app. You lure people in and then ask for money if they want to continue. Nah, I\'ll wait an hour for the ticket. Great game concept though.',
       'I\'ve only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn\'t bad. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You\'re able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! However, at the moment, it isn\'t working for me. No matter how many times I try to speed up the clock, it isn\'t budging. It was working 2 hrs ago. So, IDK if there is a daily limit or what, because I didn\'t get a warning. There is something about the videos I don\'t like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!',
       'Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',
       'I pay for the unlimited ticket and never got what I paid for. Customer service has been unhelpful. I have emailed them many times and have gotten nothing but surveys back. My issue has not been taken care of.',
       'I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I\'ve used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I\'ve recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The \'free\' diamonds doesn\'t work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn\'t pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn\'t anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these....' ],

The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I\'m really loving this game it\'s simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Gameplay isn\'t disrupted by ads unless you want some free coins once and awhile. They aren\'t throwing the loot boxes in your face either.  The coins per hour/minute seems to be while playing only. Not sure if that\'s a glitch or how it is meant to be.' ],

     [ 'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game but it takes far too long to progress. Gems are way too far and few between to enable you to \'buy\' better vehicles to defeat the boss. Then you have to also use more gems to get weapons! If you don\'t spend money it takes a long time to get anywhere. If there were more gems available this game would be a 5 star game.',
       'For as repetitive as it is I can\'t seem to put it down, it\'s seriously addictive. Maybe it\'s the great graphics or the fact it reminds me of one of my old favs arcade game  Spyhunter. A few small things I would fix are; needs a running diamond total during race to see how many you\'ve picked up. A better garage showing a side angle of your car so you can see the paint jobs and rims better and the most needed item is when you click on your profile pick there NEEDS to be a experience total! Just having the circle showing your experience isn\'t enough, I\'d like an actual number total. Also another mode to think about is maybe a side scrolling mode or overhead track mode like Grand Prix 2. All in all great graphics, music and replayability!',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!' ],

     [ 'This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn\'t at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you\'re playing as. Perfect game. 😁👍  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There\'s an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can\'t do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.',
       'I think it\'s incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.',
       'Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company\'s stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.',
       'I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you\'re done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.',
       'This game has been the only game on my phone that I\'ve played consistently. It has kept my interest and I\'ve had it as an early access.   It has improved a lot and every update makes it more interesting. This is by far the best simulator that I\'ve played on my phone. It\'s gotten more diverse and open with each update as well. So if it doesn\'t have a feature you want, give feed back on their website! They listen!',
       'First of all, congratulations on the full release! I\'ve been playing this game for a few months now and I\'m absolutely hooked. Whenever I\'m bored or don\'t want to use my phone\'s data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading' ],

       'I love this game there are so many games to play within.  One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn\'t give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star',
       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',
       'It\'s been more than a year that you haven\'t added any mini game in any update. You\'ve written on "What\'s New" section that "We\'re working on something big" but you .haven\'t shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I\'ll rate 5.',
       'I was addicted to the game the first time I played it.  Still love it and have put it on every device I\'ve had since I was first introduced to the game.  Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!' ],

     [ 'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'One of the few games that I don\'t mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card\'s artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',
       'Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer.',
       'Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I\'m watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition',
       'Brilliant game. I\'ve played this longer than any other free game. You can pay if you want to but it\'s not necessary at all if you join a good guild. The tutorial could be better though, some things aren\'t explained at all e.g. how to awaken characters. But apart from that it\'s really good!' ],

     [ 'I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you\'ll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.',
       'I love this game, today i jus download the game, cause my friend ask me tooo download this game and he also said it was fun! So I download it, and he was correct, this game is fun, I just become level 4! Not so soon I will become level 5! Yay for me😁 And I already bought the 1500 Diamond suit! It is so expensive!😲 but I just want to show  I am not a noob and I like to show at people who dosen\'t heve it, lol😂 and also I loved the game very much, so thank you for making this game and shout out to my friend Imbran! And bye😁',
       'The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It\'s intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it\'s voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.',
       'This is a really great game, I think it can go to heights where it\'ll have a PC version with a bigger city, more weapon\'s and kill tactics. It should really consider creating a store which has more item\'s though . Also can you add gas cans strategicallyy to the game, I\'d love to blow up someone hiding in a factory :) . Other than that, its a gteT game , I\'m at Level 13  and have tons of kills already in all modes so I figured you deserve a review at this point.   Keep up the great work, I love this game so far.',
       'good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members\'re 20 players. sorry for my bad english',
       'Loved this game so much! A tip for dev, You guys might wanna try to block/disable cheaters from the game on the next update though. It\'s starting made this game unjoyable to play anymore. Hope you can see my review, thanks for all the effort you gave to us guys!' ],

THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',

I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',

     [ 'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I don\'t know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I\'ll say that. I didn\'t need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I\'m out.' ],

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'Love that tekken is on the phone I was a master at it when I was younger no one could beat me with my combos and counters. The game play is good but having to heal at every opportunity is not. The fight should be about the fight not having to heal before going into the fight. If I could go into every fight with full health I would probably spend money on upgrades and fighters . It\'s good but not brilliant as tekken should be. It yous would like to hear what I have to say message me back because I love and loved tekken on the PS and Xbox one of my top 3. Games off all times. Keep up the good work but yous are not just there yet for me to spend money on it but overall it\'s good but not brilliant as it should be',
       'I just download this game today and every time i open it  in 10 to 15 sec game just close automatically. I haven\'t even do the tutorial yet this game just dont even open i love Tekken 7 i play every time in ps4 but i hate android Tekken cant even open. I will hope they fix this game.i have seen the gameplay on youtube i will give this game 5 star but only if i can play the game so untill then i will give one star because thia game graphics were cool on video Thnks for the update it works grat now',
       'iFirst of all I would say. It took me almost 30 minutes to just start the game. It was stuck in downloading screen. Later on it crashed on me  I fired up the game again and later It froze on me during the first fight. For 3rd time I started the game and it eternity to just pass through the loading screen. The data was downloading, then initializing and then loading. Took such a long time. Plz fix this issue. I really want to enjoy this game. But not like this. Even the game play is laggy.',
       'You "borrowed" a lot from MCOC, but as an avid Tekken player, I think you would have been better served sticking with the PS concept. Play the character you want, play their story for prizes at the end, and so on.  Using MCOC basic controls was cool, but if there is anything to borrow from them completely would have been the controls. Different offensive taps to create different moves, etc. Overall, it is petty solid, but could have been a hit if you stuck to your own game concept.' ],

     [ 'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game' ],

     [ 'The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can\'t even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.',
       'Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..',
       'Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn\'t have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you\'re reading this and you\'re questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! 😉😀☺',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.',
       'Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don\'t track. At least my checkpoints save.' ],

     [ 'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed',
       'The concept is more dumber than the character.. So simple i dont like it, the grapchis arw the same but i hated the concept, i thought its still the same in th 1 & 2',

     [ 'It\'s awesome very addictive, my game likes to freeze or glitch sometimes and I crash or die but it\'s a free game so not overly concerned about it. Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe',
       'It\'s a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.',
       'Temple run is one of the best game all time. Ally friends and relatives have this game in their mobile. It sounds more interesting. It is so good and time runs so fast if we start playing temple run. I like this game so much and I\'m thankful to the ones who created this game. It also makes us more addictive...',
       'I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it\'s like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn\'t die like the heck',
       'The game is cool but there\'s a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won\'t let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit' ],

I have have now stoped playing Trivia Crack. You must tighten up your App. Over the last 2 weeks, Trivia Crack has added 4 losses to my running score. I stopped playing for a week, and it still added more losses to my record. Fix it and give me my correct score  I will not play this game again in any form, and watch your endless ad\'s until my score is corrected.',
       'I generally like it, but it keeps having freezing moments. Right now it\'s trying to load an ad so I can continue on with playing, but it\'s been doing that for 5 minutes now. That has been a continued problem to where I lose my progress. I will also add the too many ads problem. Whenever you want to do anything, it\'s all ads based. I probably spend most of my time on the game watching ads rather than actually playing the game. I just downloaded today and that\'s already getting old. I like the concept of the game but needs adjustments.',
       'It is fun to test your knowledge against others. Most likely the best game app I\'ve ever used. It\'s been kind of skipping  on me lately, could be my phone?',

       'Actual trash sometimes. Ill tap to watch a video to get another chance but it just completely ignores that I\'ve watched it and ends my turn and to make matters worse, it plays an ad after that as well. Figure it out',

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars' ],

     [ 'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Seriously fun. Didn\'t think its this good. I hoped the distances between planets could be real distance. And also a option to add multiply people is indeed necessary. Cause in large numbers, that for sure player will get there, its exhausting to add lets say 300 people.  So far loving the game. And the fact that its kind of a "pick up and play" type. It would be exelent if the people you add on Europa, are the ones who are in Mars. In that case you would have to add people from Earth in order to increase them on Europa. And with that  u never could leave Earth but u have to keep working with Earth at the first place in order to explore more planets. I think this would make the game more challenging and managing. And the most important one is to have more planet plssss. This could be a historical game with more planets.' ],

So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Waste of time. I started playing the game as an offer to get points for another game. Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I\'m promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won\'t play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'Too late to join this game. As soon as you lose your newbie protection you become a farm for higher level players, preventing you from progressing. Every morning you find all your resources pillaged and your troops dead or incapacitated. Maybe I\'m just in the wrong timezone.',
       'The game has the same problems as the other versions. The events boost strong players which makes the gap in strength larger. The premium items are overpriced. Probably the worst I have seen, there is no protection for your silver. This means stronger players always have a reason to attack someone weaker and there is no protection in place after being successfully attacked.' ],

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',
       'Every once in a while when I get on I try to click my free spin and it won\'t work. So it\'s like my phone froze but I can play every other app. So it\'s just this game that freezes every once and a while. I have shut my phone down and turned it back on but I\'m not going to do that for every time I want to get on the app. I do really love it. It\'s just that it freezes so I can barely play it.',
       'As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?',
       'At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don\'t have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha',
       'There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn\'t there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.',
       'I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I\'m very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn\'t get my prize and I\'m really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I\'m expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.' ],

The concept of the game is simple - you’ve got a box of gems, and your only objective is to match and merge them to make them as splendid as possible. Every so often, you’ll be gifted a new gem - and the faster you tap on box at the bottom of the screen, the faster the gems will appear. Each gem that appears on the board can be merged with other gems of the same kind to form a greater gem - the bigger, the shinier the gem, the more currency you will earn. And the more currency you earn, the more gems you can purchase in the game store! Use your winnings to discover all sorts of new gems, and expand into new areas. All you have to do is make your gem collection the best it can be. The bar at the top of the screen measures the quality of your collection - merge gems to earn XP and level up. Higher levels will unlock more space to grow your collection - the more space you have, the more impressive your collection can become. Once you move into new areas, make sure to keep an eye on all of your collections, ensuring that you’re merging and growing them to their full potential. Merge, grow, and sparkle with Merge Gems!',

But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. 😊',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀',

It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.' ],

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!' ],

     [ 'Game unresponsive to any input on Nvidia Shield / Android TV as of the Feb 28 release.  It worked great before. Now the game starts but then it’s unresponsive to any input (controller, remote, keyboard). Other games work normally. I tried everything. Running latest version of OS, cleared game cash, game data, uninstalled game, restarted Nvidia Shield then reinstalled game. Same thing, not accepting any other input.  If this problem is resolved, I will edit my review back to 5 stars since I love the game.',
       'Update: the game keeps stealing coins from me. I had 227 coins, won a single prize, immediately play a game or two with the character, and the next time I looked I only had 16 coins. And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I\'d love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn\'t block the view of oncoming traffic.',

I would like to invest money in this but worried about tht CON. Other than that this is a very addictive throwback to a certain degree XD end up spending more time thn I realized on this game feels like I\'m on an old game boy pokemon game congratulations and many thanks for the creation of this amazing game. But admin plz fix and respond. Thankyou',
       'I paid out $160.00 for a package in the game. Got a Google game play receipt and can see the charge on my card. However I got nothing in the game and customer service hasn\'t replied to me about fixing the issue. Multiple attempts to get a hold of customer support have resulted in no responses from them.',
       'Just a knock off of Pokemon idle like really guys come on i would have played but pokemon idle is the real game here this is actually subjected to criminal defense.  You just stole another game called it something different. It better be taken off or legal action will be taken into account here noone bother with it.  Pokemon idle if you pay you get what you see that you played.  This one they steal your money as everyone is finding out the ways',
       'This game is so laughably awful it somehow is decent I will not say good but there was some charm for a moment before I found myself confused. There\'s little to no sound meaning the weird instance of sound is invasive. I don\'t understand what\'s going on at all and I don\'t feel in control of my actions in the game',
       'I gotta question. Is this like some sorta card game thing? Cuz i coulda sworn the ad made it look like the adventure 1v1 battles like in the gameboy, which was why i was interested it in the first place. But the game is completely different upon download and a dissapointment overall',
       'Did they finally made an app for this gane, what about the profile I had playing it on Facebook, pokémon Idle??? That\'s sucks having to start all over again, it\'s like having to repeat education. N\' end up droping out!!!' ],

     [ 'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'Love this game, its an addictive time killer. But I would like to have replays and not sure if it\'s only my device because I haven\'t seen other reviews about it but it doesn\'t have an accurate count of flips, my friend counted 11 and it said 3.5 I do many more (yes at one time, before landing) and it still says 3, 3.5, 4',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.' ],

If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It\'s a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.',

       'I love this  game ! I like that there is a shoe collection, although there too many ads . I also like the potions so you can turn angela into a adult or a baby, but you have to use diamonds to unlock it and you can only watch videos to earn diamonds. I just wish we could play games to earn the diamonds, It also keeps me busy. Keep up the good work 😉👍',
       'I think you need to stop rigging the wheel and actually let me get more then a few diamonds because it\'s pissing me off. Other then that the game is good',
       'This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren\'t for the ADS. I get it\'s a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.' ],

     [ 'My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I\'ve got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.' ],

It looks like it connected to a Facebook account and loaded an old game but I don\'t gave the option to disconnect. So frustrated!',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved',
       'I love this game, although It\'s not an instant gratification game, it\'s a fun for long term! Most stuff doesn\'t require real money, and the daily bonuses are great! I wish there was a way to sort the plants by amount you have, while planting.',

Please make an update where you can move these things while pets are out, or get my pet unstuck for me. Otherwise I won\'t be able to continue the game due the the inconvenience it\'s making.

       'What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don\'t lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless. Plus it\'s just an incredibly addictive game that you can do well with even if you don\'t spend any money.',
       'OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don\'t get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits',
       'Very unfair. D\'ont download it unless you want to spend a fortune. After four years of playing, the new op heroes available for cash, will crash your in a second. Be aware !!!',
       'Time to change things up IGG.   been playing for over 4 years now.  I don\'t spend alot of money but not a free to play. Im teally trying to not leave the game, but i dont feel IGG is leaving me an option at this point. I have seen guild member after guild member quit the game in the last year. If money is all thats important i understand. Ill find another game to play. UNITE AGAINST SPENDING PPL!!!',
       'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.' ],

As it comprisses of a rolling ball that is running over  an uneven path. So basically there can be competition between the bro who travelled the most distance. It also requires a good solid attention power along with patience.. So i would say its anice game. As of gameplay the is no ending or starting in the game it directly starts and that makes it more interesting. But at the same time also boring. But i would say that if u download this game u will definitely uninstall it after almost a month. Good game and waiting for an update ✌️' ],

Moreover, it doesn\'t allow me to suture the skin, even if I\'m trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...',
       'I got a new phone and I did transfer everything and it transfer my game but it started at the beginning again  I put alot of money on this game.I need it back can some please tell me how to get my game back or money I spent over close to 200 dollars on this game is so addictive. I don\'t get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.',

     [ 'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.',
       'This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it\'s so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can\'t find it 😑... the games the b💣mb. But the update I don\'t have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.' ],

The button still shows up when i play the game tho. What do i do?',

     [ 'I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It\'s simple and I like it! Couldn\'t figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It\'s KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I\'m sure that\'s on your list.',
       'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!',
       'I love this game, i\'ve been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can\'t see or control what I\'m doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.' ],

     [ 'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Some faults Overall a simple yet addictive game. Too many ads. The game ends and instantly an ad appears and your still hitting the screen so you automatically click an ad. I\'m sure advertisers don\'t want to pay for a click that was purely a mistake. Also the leader board has people on 5000 points. I can\'t get past 78 after a lot of playing so I can\'t see 5000 points is scored without a hack.' ],

It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',

Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',

     [ 'Perty good Edit: We\'re in the middle of an event and the game won\'t load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that\'s over on Friday. Do hope it\'s resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.',
       'Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don\'t play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn\'t bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don\'t waste your time or money on this company.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Good game but you need to fix your ads, half the time they either crash the game or they won\'t load and freeze the game so you have to restart. Also the game will randomly just close sometimes for no reason. Enjoy the game but there are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out.',
       'Game was fun until the Ad time increased from 30 seconds to over 2 minutes. I\'m not going to watch over 2 minutes in Ads (up to 6 consecutive time in a row totaling 12 minutes) just to play the game. Disappointed they made this change.' ],

     [ 'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'I\'ve reached on level 93 been at it for almost a week now. And it makes absolute no sense no matter which way I go. For example I will shoot a blue colour to burst the same colour and another colour shoots out. Can you fix this? It\'s frustrating. It\'s a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',

       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'For the fact that we can\'t sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it\'s a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one.

       'I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you\'re stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.',

     [ 'It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn\'t cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.',
       'At first I was a little unhappy with the amount of stuff I can do with spending diamonds, but I now find it refreshing, not to spend active hours on a game in order to receive a reward. I\'m glad they reward patience.',
       'The problem is you do these daily quest and get the crappy rewards and it takes alot of resources to complete.ive done the 7 time finish 3 times and got store building all 3 times witch i think is pathetic',
       'After it installed, I tried to play it, the innogames logo came up, a second later it quit. That\'s all it does.',

     [ 'It is so amazing i love this game and have had 3 accouts before on it. on my ipad but now i have it on my laptop. I have allways loved it and allways will.    Update suggetion: can you please add  more lvls and every time you go up a lvl you get the same stuff but can unlock more of the game but you can diside what you can ulock as i think this will make it much more funnier.  can you also make the game better by letting ipad users join laptop users in clans as i have wwr on my ipad and laptop but on my ipad i cant join my clan that is on my laptop and its unfair so please can you add this in too. I think it will make the game much better thank you   PLEASE READ!!!!!',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.' ],

     [ 'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay 😊',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.',
       'Wow, awesome game. Great controls and idea. However the following levels all fall on the same points. Christmas, valentine, all about us. These levels have bad music, theme, and overall are not fun. I value the old levels more and find them much more fun to play even f2f or the millionth time than the new levels. (the maze was fine though)' ],

Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It\'s not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please',
       'Love this game! The only part I don\'t like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won\'t buy any diamonds. I\'ll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.',
       'I like the game but waiting three hours for two passes is terrible.  And we have no other option to get free passes it is either wait or pay. I feel like I\'d we got more than two passes I would be okay with the wait. But waiting three hours knowing I am going to use those two tickets in less than a half hour is crazy.  Then I will lose interest in the story and forget what had happen, it isn\'t okay. But other than the wait for passes I really like this game.',
       'I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don\'t mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don\'t have then you should find a different app.',
       'Great app, just too many of the same type "romance" stories over and over again. It feels like only one person is writing stories on here, when It claims to have over 55,000 different stories. Each time i try to search for a new book to read a new, the same twelve pop up over and over. Fix that please. I very much enjoy supporting community made books but it seems like it\'s just a popularity contest on here, with the same story line and plots being used far too much.',
       'I really do like this app so much! I\'ve been using it for years and I have read loads of stories! However, I need to leave a poor review because I recently changed from an Apple phone to and Android phone and I can\'t transfer my data from one phone. I have gems and so many story progresses I need to keep. Please help! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭' ],

And somehow their money regenerate quicker and they\'re able to send  out more and bigger and better units out on the battlefield.

     [ 'I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I\'ve purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I\'m really hooked on. Not to mention I\'ve put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I\'m limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It\'s just too expensive in the end.',
       'I love this app! I just wish you could collect more than 2 keys at a time. Sometimes the chapters feel short and to only be able to accumulate 2 keys feels like its not enough. 3 to 5 would be way better! Its already a bummer to not have enough diamonds to unlock cool stuff. (unless you want to pay more.. Not everyone has money to spend on phone app games)',
       'I actually really like this game. It\'s fun, it\'s time killing, all that good stuff. But the diamonds are what really kill it.  You get one free diamond at the end of every chapter, which would be nice if it didn\'t cost 25+ diamonds to make a choice. So to get all the options required to have a truly full game play experiance you must buy the diamonds, which also wouldn\'t be a problem if they didn\'t cost so much. (For 5 dollars you get 60 diamonds which is ruffly 2 choices and really they should be lasting longer then that.) There isn\'t even the option to watch an add for more diamonds. Buying them is the only choice if you want to have those certain experiances. I understand that the company has to make money, I really do, but charging out the ass for something is not the way to do it. In short, I would love this game if it didn\'t cost an arm and a leg to play.',
       'I love it the most exciting story lines. I need you to write one more book about  Love Hacks it just ended suddenly. I have to know what happened to everyone if some of the other couples got married, had kids. Is some characters just single forever. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS SERIES JUSTICE. I FEEL SO HEARTBROKEN.',
       'Such a shame that the makers of this game are greedy. This is an awesome game with some great stories but unfortunately you need diamonds to make alot of decisions and you don\'t get given many as they want you to buy them.  So there\'s no way you can play the game properly. The diamonds are so over priced. If they were cheaper I might be inclined to buy them. So with regret I\'m going to have to delete this game. Greedy people thanks for ruining what could have been a fun game.',
       'There is a way to get me to give a five star review for this game.   Option 1: Convince Michael (2000 diamonds)  Option 2: Just leave it. 😁  The game and stories are great, the downside is to get more than half the story, especially the more interesting parts of the story, you have to spend diamonds.  You only receive one diamond for finishing a chapter but you can easily spend 40-50 in one chapter, which means to actually read these stories you have to spend money. I don\'t mind that the writers have done a good job, so I bought £19 worth of diamonds but I only made it through 9 chapters of one 18 chapter book before I ran out.  Diamond cost for choices should be much lower, and there should definitely be another way to earn them - watching adverts or something.  Overall the stories are great but there is no way I can afford to spend a couple hundred pounds just to finish them.' ],

     [ 'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn\'t take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.',
       'Its a cool game. If you press the hint button it gives you a choice to watch a ad for help. I am not seeing in-app purchases so far and I have had this game for a while! I recommend this but not the other version. It gets a tiny bit boring after a while though. overall, GREAT GAME! Whoever made this game is great! :) :) :)' ],

     [ 'RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent\'s cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they\'re not.',
       'GAH! They\'ve over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn\'t even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I\'m sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn\'t want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn\'t change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.',
       'I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.',
       'Can no longer watch ads to get an extra rewards chest plus, I logged in for 90 days and did not get my legendary chest. My screen froze up when I hit the claim button and had to restart my game. Now my chest is gone and the next level has appeared without me being able to chose what I wanted from the chest.',
       'Caution! Needed access to my personal files including photos to play the game.  I denied and could not start the game unless it had access. Uninstalling after this review.  Don\'t let programmers and hackers get a hold of your personal files!',
       'Graphics are good, game play can be lame at times when you get birds that are incapable of completing the level. You can\'t buy the game and that bothers me. I spent $20, (to support the effort) but am trying to keep it at that.  Others have spent $100 and more. Greed ruins this game. Just finished a level that was designed to be beat only by spending money. Spent hours trying but finally paid and beat it. The game play is not consistent. If you have a bad day it will let you win, if you\'re winning, suddenly an opponent that should never be able to beat you, kicks your ass when you\'ve played perfectly.' ],

     [ 'At first when I down loaded it I thought it would be a cheap version of real FIFA that you often have to pay for. I expected bad graphics, crashes and lots of bugs. I WAS WRONG!!! This game is literally the best ever. 01.03.18 Although in the new update I went to type something on leagues and the game just crashed, it also made my phone spam so I had to shut it down and reload my phone up, please investigate this.',
       'Overall, really love March new update & new gameplay. But still need improvement for far/long crossing. Sometimes even i try maximum, it just high, not long.',
       'It showed 1 coin to train a player with already trained player. So i upgraded 2 players but now i lost more than 700k by upgrading my players... This is not affordable. If it is a bug fix it soon. It is not a simple problem',
       'The whole resonance why I gave this game 1 star is because THERE SERVERS AND HORRIBLE. WHEN I DOWNLOADED THE GAME IT WAS OKEY BUT EVERSINCE THIS NEW UPDATE YOU SERVERS ARE POOP. I ENJOY THE GAME BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO IMPROVE YOUR STUPID POOPY SERVERS',
       'I can\'t upgrade my Vertonghen to 90 rated. It says unknown error. But I tried to upgrade my izqueirdo and he got upgraded. And when used my training xp to upgrade izqueirdo it said I can upgrade him for 1 coin. But when I upgrade, I realized that it was 200000 coins. It is glitching. Please fix this issue. But overall, the best game',
       'Day by day its getting worse...it says  unable to connect the server...iam losing my interest on the game....the challenges given should be playable in given time...but its very difficult to complete the challenges in given time....totally the game is a one Star game.' ],

     [ 'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.',
       'Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.',

It is wonderful for me because there is not a single problem. It doesn\'t seem to be bad for me i  meant the game was not at all bad and it was particularly different from some of the reviews means some people said this game this and that but it doesn\'t seem to me the same thing because each of us has a different choice but according, to me it was great, amazing, wonderful game. Thanks for making this types of games and it is good because it teaches us something so thx once again. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋',
       'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',

     [ 'What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn\'t be playing it if I couldn\'t play as Pac-Man, he\'s such a good inclusion. It\'s a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you\'re prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.',
       'Game looks good and it\'s well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m',
       'I love the new updated keep up the good work and thank you for making us vs people online this the way to earn more rings and red stars rings',
       'This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven\'t tried it. It\'s occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!',

     [ 'I didn\'t hold out much hope initially but it\'s a fabulous game. Graphics are good, there\'s a story and multiple maps etc. Its easy to progress and the special event maps were hilarious.  Definitely suitable for the majority of players and even young ones. There\'s no gore or unsuitable scenes and no constant push to buy ingame content. I wish more game developers thought like this. Properly enjoyable',
       'Great game, incredible customer service. You will never get bored with this game. Play daily as much or as little as you want. There are seasonal (timed) events to play and ongoing daily (no time limit)searches. We have all been there, missed an achievement because we logged on 10 minutes late. NO MONEY has to be spent to truely enjoy this game. Your progress or fun level isn\'t held hostage if you don\'t want to pay to play. Customer service is incredible. I was stuck and the response was quick and helpful. Even when I still didn\'t get it, think if it was a snake, it would have bitten me, they helped and never made me feel stupid. Install NOW and start having fun.',
       'Energy is spent too quickly, kind of their way of trying to make you to buy gems. I get it, and I would buy them if they weren\'t so expensive! I can barely make it through a single task, it does get quite annoying.   Maybe give us the option of watching ads for gems or extra energy, and an ad free option with minimal cost so those who would rather not have the ads get to benefit too?',
       'Love the challenge,  the mini puzzles.  The only draw back I would say.  As a new player having enough energy to complete some of the old challenges example (Valentine\'s 2017) is almost impossible.  Would love to figure out how to gain more energy. Fan page as far as I can see does not help on this.  Other then  that very enjoyable game.',
       'The instructions go by too fast,no where to look to repeat them so levels quests left half done. For example can\'t free the florists because not sure how to finish with the light beams??! Missed the hints or instructions.',
       'The only thing that would really improve this game is if you have a multi-tile selection upgrade. That would allow you to select multiple spots to dig, they would still Dig one at a time in the order of which they were selected. If they are blocked in you would have to select the tiles in order as they would become accessible.' ],

     [ 'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'Please solve these issues after last updates. Watching an ad is not reducing the remaining time for getting fuel, it is only reducing appx one minute which is not good. It used to give one life against one ad, now watching 10 ad for 1 fuel is like watching ads for 8 minutes to cover 10 minuted wait time which is meaningless.',
       'The game keeps crashing whenever I try to play it . I can only look at my cars but when I load into a race or event.  And it would be great if you guys could fix it because I usually make in app purchases if that affects you at all but otherwise great game just keeps crashing this game usually gets me stuck for hours having fun. But otherwise please try to fix , Have a wonderful night.' ],

Why is it i had completed some of the achievements but it still shows zero progress??i don\'t know if it is just only me but i really want this to be fix or any solution can the developer suggests. It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!',
       'Great game of my childhood. Unfortunately, had problems with award when you connected Google. It\'s okay that game didn\'t count some levels, but I replay all suburbs and didn\'t receive any medals and there is no progress. It\'s really sad :(',
       'This game is so good! Far too many ads tho. I am addicted!!! Dont get the wrong idea guys  from other reviews - ads dont come up in actual gameplay its just when u lose or inbetween levels',

       'Great game! Very addicting & its just like your being a real robber & make the people don\'t catch you, i like it when they investigating open doors & when they hear the dog bark because its like its realistic. Please add more Levels & make many characters not just Bob. Thank you. .',
       'Robbery Bob is an amazing game, it\'s very challenging. You just can\'t stop playing it. It doesn\'t have a lot of adds, it\'s the. Number one game to me. I\'ve never had a game this good. I\'m planning on installing Robbery Bob 2 when I finish this one 👍' ],

       'Not a clue if there\'s a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It\'s challenging but I\'ve yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though "buying lives"',
       'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'I hate the fact that one can\'t enjoy the game. So many advertising ads keep popping up one right after the other. Interrupting you while your playing the game. It\'s so annoying & fusterating. The game itself is Awesome but with all these stupid ads in the way. One gets feedup.',
       'Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw "pick 2" vs. pick 3. I\'m a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the "typical pick 3 concept"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.' ],

       'Very relaxing. I fell asleep playing this game. Though it\'s a bit addictive, so I don\'t like playing during the day. Another problem is that saving and loading the game between devices from the cloud are a bit confusing. There is no explanation and I haven\'t gotten it to work.',
       'PLEASE DON\'T IGNORE...I need help, there appears to be a glitched achievement and it\'s driving me insane. I wish not to be intrusive  about it but my Ocd\'s  preventing me from continuing on thinking I will not be getting the other achievements. It\'s the Disiplined V, which is the 4000 for the virtues, I unlocked the virtue but not the achievement . I even reset my oasis twice and nothing',
       'I really like this game, but I\'m giving it one star until they fix it. I have the auto cumulation for all the traits, but it\'s about a 30% chance it works. If I don\'t go in within the 24 hour mark (or I upgrade anything a good amount), it cuts my gains and makes it like I earned nothing. So, love this game, but until the bug is fixed, it\'s getting 1 star. It\'s really irritating I need to go through this after also sending them an email on what\'s going on.',
       'This is a great game. And I\'ve learned something from it. My lion told me,  "Don\'t judge yourself on what others do to you".  I think he said that. But it made my heart feel better. I\'ve always judged myself lile that, but now I feel as if it\'s all okay. I feel better.    I really like this game because one, I love nature, two, I love animals, and three, these animals are so nice on what they say and it makes you feel better.  EVERYBODY SHOULD GET THIS. EVEN IF TOU DONT NEED IT.  STILL GET IT LOL  And for those of you who think it\'s just an old tapping game, you\'re right and you\'re WRONG. You\'re right because, yeah, you do tap a lot. You\'re wrong because you not supposed to jam your finger on the screen and do it super fast. It\'s basically optional to do so. Tapping only gives you more points. So how about you folks calm down and rethink this... And just STOP. All of this COMPLAINTMENT. OH, IT\'S THEN END OF THE WORLD BECAUSE I DIDN\'T GET WHAT I WANTED. IT\'S THE END OF THE WORLD BECAUSE I CAN\'T RETHINK ANYTHING AND I\'M JUST GONNA FREAK OUT OVER A SMALL GAME!!!  It\'s a game genius. Get used to it. -.-',

All in all, if you could do that, it\'d make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there\'s no use for coins.',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I\'m very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing',

     [ 'Amazing addictive game. Try it out! Not too many ads, and just the right amount of challenge without pulling your hair out. Sometimes there\'s a hidden dot in the title, or ones that are almost the same color as the background, but it\'s not bad enough to lose a star.',
       'Updated with no fix...  problem still persists.  No exit button and controls for the back button are very wonky. Need to add dedicated exit button or fix what happens when you tap / swipe the blank park of the screen. Trying to bring the controls up from their hidden state selects options is frustrating. You end up starting games. Very unpolished controls, imo.',
       'Cool game, only bad thing is that tutorial levels are rated as bronze so you can never have all gold.. I tried doing the same tutorial three times in a row, then it is counted as gold, but when you exit the game and enter again that it is bronze again',
       'Interesting puzzle type game.  Using rope is a bit challenging on small screens.  It used way too much background data which is not have related at all.  My phone gets hot when using the app.  Uninstalling',
       'Different and fun. Not too hard but still challenging.  Daily challenges are impossible to complete though (bug?) , so don\'t bother with them (hence my only giving 3 stars)',
       'This right here is a work of genius.  My only wish is for an undo button, for when you accidentally touch a part of the screen and it places a spot/cut/bridge in an unwinnable spot.  Especially annoying during daily challenge that you can\'t re-do.  Also, I would like to be able to retry any level, such as the daily or randoms, even if it wouldn\'t "count". I\'m convinced every so often there is an unwinable level, but you can\'t even test it or let the devs know because once you fail it goes away permanently.  Still, a great, great game... I really hope there is a V2 some day.' ],

Unfortunately last 2 times I\'ve started a puzzle it doesn\'t save my progress. I\'ve gotten to 80% and 40% complete on the same puzzles & it didn\'t save my progress. Had to restart the same puzzle twice now. I haven\'t started a new puzzle since. Don\'t want to waste my time redoing puzzles I\'ve already done just because my progress wasn\'t saved. Very frustrating. Before this it was a great app!',

That and the lag when trying to move pieces. Oh and the incessant pestering to upgrade and rate',

     [ 'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'It\'s a good game overall but the songs that are supposedly meant to be free aren\'t. I would rate it 5 stars but I can on play 3 songs every 24 hours. I\'m trying to workout while doing this but a workout isn\'t a very good workout if it\'s only for 6 minutes. Please give us a higher coin  limit and cut the wait time down some. Then and only then will I rate it 5 stars.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!' ],

If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. 👌👍❤',

     [ 'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',
       'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Feels like lots of players are AI bots. I\'ve won my first 10 matches with a 10+ holyshit mega kill every time. Looks a bit pay to win as a champ you must buy has a very OP skill. The amount of awakening to hit 5 and get the extra skill is astronomical and will require money to be spent. Also, not one person is speaking English. It\'s all Spanish/Portuguese.' ],

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',

Fix then 5 stars',

EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can\'t wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.',
       'Brilliant follow-up to YELLOW! ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! And, there ARE games trying to pretend that they\'re the same...only Bart Bonte does it right!  I try not to let myself do too many levels at once, just so I can extend the game. I can\'t wait for the next color!',
       'This game and yellow have single handedly improved my relationship with my niece. She loves playing these games over and over every time she comes to visit. Christmas day she didn\'t want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.',
       'By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another "Yellow 2", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)',
       'Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I\'m familiar with Bart\'s mind by now. &lt;3 I think it\'s great that clues are available though and that they don\'t give everything away right away. It\'s a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!',
       'Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bart Bonte! I\'ve been waiting for a very, very long time for this game to come out since I first played "Yellow". Thanks a lot! But here are a few other questions I have for you: what will be the next game? How long will I have to wait until the next game comes out? Could you at least give me a hint? Thanks!' ],

     [ 'Was an awesome game. There were bugs that were resolved. Now, it\'s pretty much assured that in order to keep playing, you have to buy keys in order to get the cars for the prestige cups. For the last four months I have gotten the same tier one and two cars over and over again. If you don\'t mind spending that much money, it\'s great. As for me, it just became a major turnoff.',
       'Really really addicted. Yes you know when your good. Yes you do.  Ok honest? Expand on the shop.  Tweaking the appearance and performance of the rides.  Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that\'s how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Very cool game with good graphics but beware for this game is based around paying to play. The purchases aren\'t cheap either. If you\'re not careful you could find yourself spending hundreds yet still not getting what you need to beat the bosses. So if you\'re into forking up your hard earned cash by all means enjoy.',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.' ],

       'I\'ve played this game since it started. My grandkids used to play until the constant glitches and the hot trails. I just don\'t understand why your company can\'t keep the glitches out. My desire to keep playing is waning on a daily basis. *sigh* I don\'t know why I even waste my breath.',
       'The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I\'ve reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn\'t sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall',
       'I like this game but there\'s so much cheating going on. It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',
       'Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won\'t do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.',
       'This game is awesome and funny I guess. I\'m trying to think of something to complain about (I love complaining) but I can\'t!! Oh wait........... You could make things like characters and stuff less expensive. It\'s  Ike....I go on SHOP and it says stuff like (random minion) 1234 tokens!!  Dats 2many bro!' ],

     [ 'Okay listen, this app is surely good and relaxing, but I must say, i am having trouble with getting the game right easily. What I am trying say is sometimes the game freezes and I am coming upon some glitchey reactions. I would really appreciate if you made the game a little more calm or just review some things you can edit. I would like to keep contact with you. So if you have any suggestions on how you can make the game a little better just let me know. I\'m looking forward to some edits here so I hope you can figure something out. I\'m not trying to be bossy, I\'d just wanted a little arrangement for your game. So just keep working hard on your games. Thank you very much! Okay now I gotta play the game. Bye!',
       'UPDATE- STILL NO MORE LEVELS ONCE I\'VE GOTTEN TO 1190.. IF THIS IS THE END PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN DELETE APP AND MY HUSBAND CAN STOP WASTING HIS TIME PLAYING IT!!! ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I\'m on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn\'t have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!',
       'I\'m not trying to be a hard ass, but I take issue when games like yours automatically goes into a tutorial mode instead of offering it as a choice. It drives me crazy. If your game gave the user the choice of either to use the tutorial or not my ratings would be between 4 & 5 stars.',

     [ 'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.' ],

     [ 'The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won\'t download. I get a "connection error", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again.',
       'It\'s a good game don\'t get me wrong but even though you\'ve upgraded things fully you still need to use the spoons to complete certain levels which dose not make sense unless they want you to spend your money to go further. Good game but you can only go so far without spending real money.',
       'Its a great game with good controls but the amount of real money you have to spend is just astronomically bad. I dont mind spending a few bucks a week to get through a lvl been stuck on for a while but this game is money sticky and it would seem no matter what stratergy you use just cant to seem to swing it....annoying',
       'Good game been playing it everyday for a few months. Ive been getting the daily bonus but what is annoying is when you get to day 7 the next days bonus is back to day 1. Why not continue with day 8 then day 9 and so on. Getting better things the longer you keep coming back.......😔',
       'Its pretty fun except there\'s several levels u can\'t can\'t pass unless u spend spoons multiple times! And I refuse to spend money on a game.',
       'I like the game but, you are forced to purchase spoons and boosts. When you get to Paris you can\'t get through level 9 because you don\'t make enough coins to buy upgrades. I used the cook instantly boost and it threw more customers with more food requests at me and they leave because the game doesn\'t serve the customers in order of when they arive. Customers at the end walk up then walk right out, and if you extend time it will send 2 customers when you need 3 or 4. All of these are the reason I won\'t purchase anything on this game.' ],

Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.Play with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.Designed for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.Bored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play\'s "Game Services".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden. Instead you must find the words within the grid. Useful in combination with word categories.2) Play against others.3) Give us feedback on other features you would like to see.Dictionaries available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Indonesian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian(Latin), Serbian(Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovene, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and more coming later',

     [ 'This wordsearch is brilliant.can play it for hours. The graphics are brilliant also the different settings where you can change the list colours . Or background colours. Or button colours. I like that can change the min length of a word. And you can choose the difficulty. And the max word length brilliant the only thing I would say. Is can you put more choices of colours for background colours. And list colours. Also button colours',

     [ 'Love this game...best WWE Game on mobile, and I\'ve played them all. So addicting I spend money on it. I do wish it was easier to get TP, and tokens to level up superstars. I\'ve been playing for almost a year, and have EASILY spent 6 or 700 on this game, and only have 1 three star superstar....only because i bought TP  and Arn Anderson crate over Christmas!! For some reason, I\'m still addicted.',
       'Real talk. The game is a blast but if you are going into it thinking its free to play you will be in the pit of misery for a long time. It takes money to get up to par really quick and its always fun to watch the cpu combo you to death when you have 0 control over it. But take the bs with the good and its a fun game but dont think for free is for me on this one. Gotta pay to play.',
       'Much better update. Battery life is actually decent. No freezes yet. I like the new system to make more coin. Still a grind, but I don\'t mind. I spend some money here and there. Suggestions: bring women\'s division. Unlock finishers, seriously, Bray Wyatt doesn\'t use a Stone Cold Stunner. Please add new music. Thanks!',
       'Love the game except now it\'s not going past the loading screen and can\'t get on to play has been like it since last update... have waited giving the benefit of the doubt that a new update may come and fix whatever bug has caused the issue but still no joy... please fix galaxy s8 new update still not working',
       'Overall its a great game. Problem is once I do a feud, after the brawl.is over, the page keep flashing. I cannot do fued anymore. I have to leave faction and rejoin, all my previous top 10 scores are reset. Its keeps occuring. Anyway to rectify?',
       'Great game, But game wouldn\'t open for days, even with high speed internet connection, takes forever loading.. - that makes me sick. I just got to uninstall it. Sucks up my bundle data for nothing without opening. Dries my battery too like hell' ],

       'A great game and extremely addictive once you really get into it. Well thought out. It can be very time consuming but that is what makes it great. The grind to level up Heroes makes me want to come back and carry on, unlock other heroes and further upgrade my Kingdom. My only issue is the fact that resources are hardly able to be kept. Being under constant attack from other groups and unable to allow my Kingdoms walls to regenerate properly before I am able to move again seems to be a recurring issue and one I do feel needs to be looked at and tweaked. Nonetheless, I\'m impressed with the game. Continue with the good updates and this game could be one of the best mobile games out there.',
       'I have played the game for about a week.  In all that time I have never been able to communicate with other players in the game, or change my avatar.  After a several day period of asking for assistance from the developer\'s support, they have finally concluded that unless you have a 4G connection, like verizon, or at&t, that the chat, and avatar change parts of their game will not work.  At least they suggested I spend money on 4G, and see, if that solves the problem.  Very depressing.',
       'Great game with some serious server lags and crashes. At this point I can\'t play for more than 5 minutes without having to restart it. Very frustrating and makes me avoid battles. The lag will prevent you from using spells and being able to fully compete against the enemy. When this happens it takes days to heal your troops. Fix the lag and this has the potential of being a 5 star game',
       'Hello dev... Please try to solve the duelling problems. I got stuck every time someone challenge a duel with me. I cant even use any of my heroes ability. And many are having this problem. Please try to fix this issue as soon as possible or im not spending another dime in this game... And please don\'t bother replying back with send a text to our page on fb or etc coz it takes decades to get a reply so just freaking solve this issue please. Thanks',
       'This game is destroyed by money. Every realm has at least one player who spends thousands of dollars and just skews the gameplay away from a fair contest. Wouldn\'t hesitate to give a 5 if there was a cap on spending' ],

Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯',
       'So far I really like plating this game. Its the best bowling app I\'ve tried. The only thing I don\'t like is that most of the balls are level locked. I understand why its designed that way but I would like to see a better selection to purchase with chips that aren\'t level locked. Also, provide more ways to get cash and diamonds besides only being able to purchase them.',
       'Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can\'t actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don\'t let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it\'s a glitch in the game I\'m not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.' ],

     [ 'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I\'ve made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new "club wars" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There\'s always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don\'t have to spend real money to play the game, but I\'ll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I\'ve even started a second city on another device with my other email.',
       'Maybe the money issue. Hardly get dollars \'even though yall make money off selling them" i feel like if you have alot of people.. And a high hapliness rate in your City\' Maybe you can earn cash kinda easier?',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'I would of rated this 5 stars if I didnt loose all mt progress I tried logging in to google play but it said sorry mayor this city is linked to another device. This is the same phone I\'ve had it on so im really really ANGRY about it so yeah. Help me get my old city back ELECTRONIC ARTS . My city had over 100,000 population I had the airport Dr vu\'s tower and the port and everything else apart from the building so yea. Im so bummed. HELP ME PLZ' ],

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don\'t reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie\'s handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.',

The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',

The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator\'s cost 100 coins while Dune It Up\'s cost 1000-2000?',

However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.',
       'Such a great and fun game but you can\'t do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.',

       'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective. I will be deleting now at level 6',
       'I really enjoy thie game especially the archipelago tasks. The quests on my island are pointless and so hard to do though. It took ke about a week to save up 1000 coins to give to the mumumba guy.  This is really a long time to earn money. Its a little better now with the adverts as you can skip times and earn coins watching videos.',

     [ 'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don\'t like that, you\'ll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it\'s a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊' ],

     [ 'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ],

     [ 'The game had me hooked as I spent a week trying to find a character and job class I liked. Keep in mind that you will be doing a lot of grinding, but leveling is not surprisingly unreasonable.  There are some aspects that will make you believe you have to pay to win, but it is not necessary. Although it would be cool to help the devs or too. All in all love the game and can\'t seem to put it down ( I let it auto-grind while I live my life. Haha).',
       'Well, I loved the looks of it. Seemed really fun so I downloaded it. Then I spent 30 min downloading the patches, to find out at the very end I didnt have enough space on my phone. Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn\'t have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer',
       'So, far really love to play. I only just started though. The controls are hard but that\'s probably because I\'m playing on a tablet and I got small hands. Unfortunately, I don\'t think I\'ll be able to continue playing this. For some reason it makes my tablet terrifyingly hot to the point I\'m concerned. I\'ll hold on to the app for now in case it gets better in the future.',
       'An amazing mmo that really does a great job of handling farming, the game play although has an auto feature still utilizes the controls. The depth of all the items and armor and weapons is awesome. I\'ve been really happy playing this game. The clans are great. The 30 vs 30 opensiege is a nice feature. This game is super fun even for the people that want to play for free. Netmarble does a great job with daily rewards, login bonuses, and events that all allow for players to get great items for free!! Best game I\'ve played in a long while. Only thing is constant crashes and bad story line. The game keeps me turning it back on and I haven\'t went one day without logging in.',
       'Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don\'t have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well.

     [ 'After using it for more 2 weeks here is my review;  This is a great time killer and addictive too. Nice collections of tools, items, etc. But when we tried to play using wifi this lagged like anything. Dead slow and we had no fun of playing and competing. The developer may look into this or give us any guidance for smooth 1vs1 play via wifi.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'It lags everytime we use the multiplayer and the developer needs to look on the Bluetooth connection as well. Super lag. :( please update this coz I love this game a lot!  Update:  Wow! Thanks for giving me heads up! I seriously appreciate for looking into this. :) keep up the good work!',
       'Hi,  It\'s been almost one month i am using this game. But there are many problems in this game: 1. game is slow in a multi player mode. 2. Most of the time if you play one on one using wifi or personal hotspot. The game will connect you with yourself only. 3. Most of the time you\'re unable to connect with with your friends only. In a month i connected with my friend thrice only.  I have a screenshot also where you can see that the game is sending a join request to myself only not my friend.',
       'decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.',
       'Game was too easy. 99.4% winrate and just passed 6500 trophies. I was expecting more but unlocking elite level tournament was all. Even after winning elite tournament nothing happened. Its a bottomless pit, there is no more progression after reaching 6500 trophies and winning elite level. Basic games nowadays have at least a multiplayer mode with leaderboard for trophies. That would be a big game changer for this but for now, no purpose in this game at all' ],

I enter the details, it tells me that I\'ve already logged in, I go back to the game and it just does the same thing over and over..... Anyone know how to solve this issue? Website is no use at all',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',

Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.',
       'I loved the mighty league ... until it forced an update that caused a glitch, and all of a sudden I was back in the Feather league --- and no matter what I did, I couldn\'t get out of it. I waited for update after update --- but to no avail. I was stuck. Not so fun anymore. So I uninstalled and reinstalled --- and lost over 13,000 points.  But at least I got to play again. I built my way back up... only to have it glitch again, sending me back to the Feather league. More frustrating than fun #Fail' ],

The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',

Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',

Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',

I mistakenly pressed a large amount purchase, I contacted them and they made it impossible for me to get a refund.. they gave me an email address and 6 times it was returned to me, saying that they refused receipt..

     [ 'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'Most realistic wolf sim I have found out there, with the ability to get a mate, have cubs and your own den in which you can invite players into. There are also multiplayer game servers and an ability to create your own public or private game. You can also play as a wolf, fox or lynx and customize eyes, pelts and add masks/hats and scars/clothing. Its just AMAZING! Also saying that you don\'t have to pay to play and in-game currency is easy to get.',
       'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Most awesome wolf simulator game I have ever played! The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the controls are pretty good. Although getting attacked by several animals at once when you only go for one makes completing missions pretty hard. And you should be able to run from a fight if you\'re losing, instead of having animals come at you until you\'re dead. All in all a great game play experience though. I love it!',
       'Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don\'t think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!' ],

     [ 'It\'s a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don\'t take it seriously! I\'m not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that\'s just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!',
       'This is a great game... You should play it if you like gymnastics and if you are board,You   should download this game... Is very fun... I liked it... But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!',
       'I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the \'X\' button it shouldn\'t show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!',
       'Really was enjoying this app, then about 10 minutes in video ads started popping in literally every 1 or 2 minutes. This totally killed the fun factor; not only was I unable to complete any tasks or just enjoy the game but the crummy ads actually kept booting me off the app. What a complete buzz kill; even tho this app was super cute & the graphics were total eye candy, the constant interruptions barging in were beyond ridiculous; both in longevity & frequency.',
       'Its os fun how you want it to be. But pls do more like the balance beam and vault because this game is just right for me the cool thing about this is pretty much everything but pls do the balance beam and the vault becuase im liking this! All the features are really working well but when you spin the gymnast to get a little look it is like lagging😣 but i love this game totally 5 stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟! Who ever made this app its so great keep on the updates! And pls pls PLS tell me if theres an update of the balance beam and the vault!',
       'This is from my daughter, "I like the game but there\'s some things about it I kind of don\'t understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she\'s practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot."   This is from me, "the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it\'s fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall."' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love love LOVE this game. Im no bot i swear. This game is so addictive. Gameplay is great. A few suggestions however. Sometimes i find my "sword" just going right through some fish, and it doesnt kill them. Also, maybe switch up some ways to get Stars. I find myself saving so much to get the 99k sword fish and never buy any other fishes. I feel like the players should work their way up slowly and not have to play with only the "daily reward" fishes. Just my suggestion  Thank you guys!',
       'Great game, good servers, rarely any lag, and addicting. However, the price for characters is pretty steep, their not even worth buying since you\'ll get better daily characters by the time you have enough stars to buy a good character. Save up for the end game characters. Also, the left joystick is fairly close to the edge of the screen and makes it a little hard to stay on the screen. You get use to it after a while but it would be nice to have other control setups or custom controls.',
       'Great game. Just the spawns on Kill the King and stuff suck since people can spawn right in you. Also, it is kinda rigged when you have the default fish vs someone with one of the best ones.',
       'Great game, its so addicting!  But there is only 1 problem, theres so much lag. Pls fix!! :)',

     [ 'Fastest uninstall ever. 15 seconds of gameplay, then 15 seconds of timed add. Can anyone spot the fake reviews? Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout' ],

     [ 'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.',
       'Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.' ],

     [ 'Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly',
       'So far, not bad.  Update:  gathered enough parts to repair the university and it won\'t unlock.  I emailed the developer and haven\'t heard back.  It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can\'t use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.',
       'You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.',
       'Great time killer... Love it so far and only been playing since yesterday... Already level 11 and got quite a few things however I gave 4 stars because I spent 10 diamonds on the bank which showed the stock market but didn\'t tell me it was coming soon until I paid for it... I like that this game doesn\'t make you pay real cash and gives you tokens just to win more cash, diamonds, energy etc so please don\'t ruin the game in the future and make us pay 2 play =)',
       'The game is over good. It\'s definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can\'t obtain "glass" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can\'t move up, it\'s pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don\'t want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it\'s a good game and I would recommend it',
       'It\'s a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don\'t know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.' ],

     [ 'I love the game, but I recently unlocked trading and whenever the trade is accepted or cancelled I do not get my guns. It only worked for me once and that was when the trade was cancelled. The second time I cancelled the trade, I was putting my guns in the trading slot and I didn\'t accept the submission. I went back to retrieve my guns but it took them out of my inventory and didn\'t give them back. The third time was today when my friend was trading me some knives. We both accepted the trade and I never got the knives but my friend got everything I put in.(He has Iphone) Can you please fix that in the next update? I would appreciate it if I was able to successfully trade.',
       'The reason I give this a three star IS BECAUSE A DRAGON LORE WAS LOST IN TRADING SO NOW IT\'S GONE Edit: nvm I was just being retarded this game is great lol',
       'One of the best and closest to CS GO games out there. Cant stop playing even if you\'re poor but getting better is the fun part!',
       'Would like to see the new clutch case added into the game game, but keep improving EDIT: Thanks for adding the clutch case, took me forever to unlock, Keep up the great work again :)',
       'It\'s simple and it has a lot of depth for a clicker game. The gameplay will be fairly familiar if you have ever played a clicker game and have a basic understanding of how the whole cs:go skin system works. The controls are great, the game runs smoothly and it has never lagged or crashed (for me at least). The adds in the game are put really tastefully, you are never forced to watch them you can only choose to do so for a really slight bonus/advantage. If you really want to you can play the game without watching any adds what so ever. The micro transactions are really minor, they don\'t give you a huge advantage, they aren\'t forced on you and you don\'t need them to get far in the game (unlike most mobile games). The micro transactions are kind of just there for if you want to support the developers. Overall a great game 10/10',

     [ 'If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don\'t mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.',
       'I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There\'s ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there\'s one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It\'s miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi',
       'Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there\'s some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That\'s pretty lame. Other than that great game',
       'That\'s crazy you allow hackers to have the highest score and also show the video. Say that person isn\'t cheating and I\'ll show you a video where he shows how he does it. A-hole.',
       'Fun...until you had to beat an opponent to proceed to next level. These opponents are too much of a jump up on the difficulty of that level. So can\'t pass...no longer fun...uninstalling',
       'This game sucks! You guys are all game reviews. The controls are horrible. I can\'t even win a race! I practice and nail it then race someone and can\'t even finish the same course! Screw this game' ],

     [ 'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Ads popped up every 45 seconds. I timed it. Made the game useless for my son (4). And he really wanted to play it too.',
       'My daughter loves this game so much! Good job guys. However we need your help, i made a purchase to unlock all ponies, however, somehow they got locked again and we needed to purchase again to unlock everyone. It was kinda disappointing, please help us on this matter.',
       'Was a favourite of my daughter\'s until she finished all the levels and now it does nothing. You can\'t replay once completed. So buying the up grade was a waste of money. Such a shame was a great app' ],

     [ 'Great game, lots of fun. Would give it 5 stars but it is WAY TOO SHORT! More cities and continents to conquer, please...I\'d conquered everything and wasn\'t even halfway done upgrading all of my unit types, and had barely even touched all the general, base and army upgrades you get from leveling up. More achievements would be nice too!',
       'It\'s an enjoyable game, I\'m near the last bases to conquer and wondering what happens afterwards. Took me about a week to get there. Big minus is, despite muting al game sounds and music, the app deems it necessary to limit the master volume of my phone while playing, quite annoying when listening to my own music while playing',
       'I like the game style, the graphics, it\'s very fun and addictive, but it needs more to it. I played this game for about 4 days, and I no longer have any use at all for gold. I\'ve conquered all the territory\'s and have everything unlocked and maxed out aside from my leave. This game could be a lot better if there was more to do. Over all, it\'s fun, and has a lot of potential, but could definitely use some additions.',
       'The game is pretty good. Not terribly long but yes it\'s addictive which makes it shorter. I wish towers and catapults were automated. In later levels I\'m trying to click so frequently I can\'t focus on watching the fights.',
       'The concept is good but its just too easy. I am level 9 and took out the level 75 city in 1 try. Its not very challenging and you don\'t make a ton of money so its boring',
       'Playing game was Fun but as soon as a rated game 5 Stars I couldn\'t go back to map to take over other lands it just played music but screen was blue.. this is why I stopped playing games in the first place because it\'s a waste of time!!' ],

For when I went back I realized I wasted all that time going to level 7 on big fish games and instead of having 60 gems I have 60 minutes of wasted time. Great game. Horrible reward system. I will rate the game 5 like it should be when I receive 60 gold. Unfortunately I like the game so I will continue to playing. I am level 27 after all.',
       'prices in the game are not well distributed. you can unlock new players only with gold but gold is obtained so hard. on the other hand, money is useless after some point. you can only use upgrading players but it also requires gold. you can obtain golds with watching ads and playing every tournament over and over again to level up and gain gold but after some point you cannot unlock new players (therefore cannot unlock new tournaments) because it requires so much gold. the game forces you to buy golds. fun game but only a short period of time',

    description: 'Children\'s doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames',

     [ 'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       'I don\'t think it\'s the best game... but it\'s something but..when I colour it it just fills up the hole page. So yeah I don\'t really like it that much and I deleted it when I wrote this so... not a good game but ok' ],

     [ 'Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn\'t notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile',
       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brain😀 anyway superr game excellent',
       'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',
       'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'This game is challenging. I was so addicted I wanted to se what would happen if I got up to 4096.  Well ai did and it actually worked! I even have a screen shot. Fun!',
       'I\'ve been having issues with this app for months, where it will sometimes act as if it received multiple inputs in rapid succession. This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I\'m playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I\'ve gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018' ],

     [ 'So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn\'t find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren\'t extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don\'t know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I\'m not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.',
       'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'I think that this game brings back memories of the times that we all played on the first one and seeing this new one with more actions and abilitys and many more things to do is just what I would expect from something from the old stick war 1 game and I just would love to see more stick war games like these overall I love this game and I think it was the best',
       'Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it\'s not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I\'ve survived 24 nights but I don\'t even have the achievements for"survive 5 nights". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don\'t because some of the zombie achievements I\'m not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I\'m currently at 59.

     [ 'Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',
       'Game has so much potential and is a blast. I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it\'s annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere',
       'Great game.   But one of the adverts is a virus.   The IG Academy advert wrecked my game and now my phone\'s being a pain in the ass',
       'I really this game, plenty of challenging levels, very addictive for sure. I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again. Sometimes I wanna quit this game but I never do.' ],

       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'Very unfair, questionable dice rolls against computers, obviously rigged so that on single player you can never win, and then online it pits you against people who are expert when you\'re a beginner so you can clearly never win.

Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',

     [ 'Okay game. As a musician of multiple instrements, I can say that this game requires no musical talent. It is just a tap fast game. But if you like games like guitar hero from the 2000\'s only without the weird hippies and nicer music, then this is the game for you. In my opinion the game is okay, not very interesting but a definite time burner. To many ads but if you dont mins that, then its fine.',
       'the game is awesome i loved it but  i want one change that is please give the feature of recording it would be a great game with recording function yet it is best piano game I love it so much some levels are quite hard and some are quite easy but still its an awesome game please download it if you love songs and piano😍😍😍😘😘😗😗😙😎😎😎😋😋😀😀😀😀😚😚😚😙😙😘😘🤘👌👌👌👍👍👍👄👄💋💋',

As the level goes up, maybe the minimum increases slightly.  *Tools!!!! Ive never seen a pawn shop without tools. We need tools *Cars, go carts, motorcyles, 4wheelers. Wheres that stuff at?. *Guns, no guns either. Like civil war era type items, unless these are all avaliable at much higher levels.',
       'Overall this game is fun. Only bad thing to say is there is way too many ads. I believe it discourages you from playing the game longer due yo an ad every like 30 seconds',

     [ 'This game is ingenious and amazing, and the script is beautiful and gameplay is simple and straightforward, timeless, and fun, with increasing difficulty, but also, able to go back and compete against yourself for more Rewards. The user interface is spot-on, and the graphics are perfect. They scale well to any resolution and any aspect ratio, taking up the entire screen without any letterboxing. The actual gameplay is simply a 2 button gameplay, left and right, and yet, this game kept me busy for hours. It\'s addicting, but doesn\'t require you to consistently visit the app. It does not nag you in any way.  I have not seen a single advertisement, and the developer does not have any big paywall or reward system for paying. You will not need to spend any money on this.',
       'I think it is a good idea done well. I havent had any problems so far and the game os more than i expected. I thought the game would just be full of mindless levels but it is not. It even has a cool story and i cant wait to see how it plays out. There ia a cool mechanic wherd you get a speed boost the closer you are to the walls. I really enjoyed the game and i think it deserves 5 stars. This is the only mobile game i loved so much i actually made a review for.',
       'This is the best game ever, that I have ever played 1. I loved the story (You will know what I mean when you have played) 2. The controls are very strange and frustrate some people. But I think that\'s what make the game challenging 3. THE MUSIC. I loved the choices they have made with the music. It\'s really good love it 4. The graphics are really good couldn\'t ask for more 5. Really like the secrets   PS. Would like if you could at some kind of multiplayer when you have beaten the game  - Love Ln\'TCore',
       'Vey cool! Haven\'t finished it yet, though. The only thing that would make this better would be if the controls were a little bit better and more responsive  (which I know is hard to do on mobile or tablets), and some of the levels are nearly impossible  (at least for me). Nonetheless, I like it! Keep it up with the good work!',
       'Saw this before and saw 4.9 out of 5 with over 80,000 reviews. That\'s... unheard of on the store. So I came back to try it out. Completely worth it. Gameplay is flawless, visuals are gorgeously retro and vaporwave, the soundtrack is all retrowave from various artists, and the story is really good too. It\'s not often I rate games, and even then I\'m not excited when writing them. For this one I can\'t praise this game enough. Perfect retro-styled racing gem on Google Play.',
       'I don\'t often play games and I never review them. But this game absolutely merits five stars.       The writing is stunningly brilliant, kind of like if Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was made into an arcade game.  A very simple and somehow-complex 1980s arcade game.  With lots of fun and poignant nerdy jokes, and all female characters.      The story is full of mystery and human intrigue, and somehow also a nihilistic treatise on technology and how it functions in our life. And I sincerely apologize if that ruins any surprise for anyone still reading this review.' ],

     [ 'First off, I\'d like to say that this game was a great idea. The idea of taking a clicker game and turning it into an esports theme was amazing. However, once I downloaded it, I was flooded with ads. I understand that free games need a way to make money, but this is an example of what NOT to do. Every time you click to open a certain menu, you have a 50% chance of being shown an ad (or at least it felt that way). If there wasn\'t a crazy amount of ads, then I\'d give this game a better rating, but, until ads are regulated, I am leaving a 1 star review and uninstalling.',
       'I really enjoyed this game. The graphic were nice and the controls were clean. But i couldn\'t go 2 minutes without a ad. It constantly interrupted my tapping and would open the play store. I understand some ads comes with the territory of mobile games, but this was too much. 😔',
       'It was fun but every time I went to do anything an ad popped up. If I was lucky it would be 10-20 seconds but on several occasions I got 1-3 minute ads and it made it really hard to progress. I also was unable to buy the ad thing so I see no more ads. Until that gets put in I\'m not playing this game it is fun though but the ads are excessive',
       'I am not a fake reviewer, I\'ll be honest all the way. This game is one of the best clickers I\'ve ever played. But, be warned. Unless you plan on paying to remove ads, the ads will destroy your desire to play this game. Ads will pop up by just navigating your screens. Not sure yet if buying the cheapest diamonds package will remove ads. But after one more day I might try it.',
       'Game was a decent clicker. I couldn\'t enjoy it for more than two minutes without another awful ad popping up. I am all for watching an ad for bonuses and power ups but I was having ads randomly in the middle of clicking it between screens. Installed it after ten minutes.   They have an "ad free" option but when you click it it comes up with an error!',
       'Why do you guys hate the game because of ads... you can just turn on airplane mode and it won\'t show ads. The game has a great idea and really nice graphics for a game on phone. There isn\'t really much controls because its a clicker game. I just don\'t understand why do you rate it 1 star just because of the ads... rate it 3 stars or something because this game doesn\'t deserve lower rating than that.        Like if u agree with me.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out',
       'Being Honest this game hasnt really been up to date with others competitors. One thing I think would be lovely is a training camp/single player bot practices to do with new heros. Maybe a small revamp to the art style like 5% realism. And to decrease the amount of gold heros cost, really turns down the tone to play more for new heros',
       'Edit from my earlier review.  I re-downloaded this game after giving yall some time to work through some issues Id been having.  Lo and behold... All of my progress is gone. I was a high level with numerous heroes and skins I cant get anymore. Yet when I relog in from my google account and my FB account, it still has me at this new level with none of my stuff. What the heck yall.' ],

I have accidentally spent them 2 times on things I would never use them on after trying to save them up. I\'m not the only one. Please fix this! I love the game but that part really sucks and makes me want to quit. I will go back to 5 stars on everything if that is taken care of. Please include some kind of message interface. More gifts to send would be nice. There is so many neighbors but only 5 gifts to give!',

       'Good game, but after you go so far the game say something about the server, don\'t know if it\'s updating or what but after that you have to start all over. So don\'t spend money to advance, because you may get screwed like I did. Yet and still nice game to pass the time.',

On lever 14 now, the pace is slowing down to encourage you to buy crystals but I\'m too tight to do that! So I have to wait 2 days to break up some rocks or build a new building.

He might run at the first sign of danger, but when it comes to helping his friends, he’s always ready to step in! Fred is the glue that keeps Mystery Inc. together, and his mind is always two or three steps ahead of the monster they’re after.

     [ 'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'NC and you know what you doing today beautiful lady and her husband to be with u but I can\'t wait till I see you in the car and my mom said she will be here for me to go to the store and get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get the money for the first time I was just wondering if you want to be a good day at work and I don\'t know what I',
       'This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn\'t make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I\'m to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don\'t waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff',
       'It is awsome I love how on the last level (the black night) has two levels the black night and the vampire  the whole game is so fun I\'m done the whole game still play it all the time  but it needs more levels love it so much  so it needs MORE LEVELS' ],

And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I\'m starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely....

     [ 'You are fake news! Wait 30 min to refill just 5 lives play a level and not pass it cause its ethier extreme luck or pay to win garbage. Give me infinite lives it just gets too boring when i cant play the levels back to back also lvl 155 cant even beat it with the way the power ups work never can i get close your game is just a pay to win garbage',
       'It started great and I was so looking forward to exploring all the rooms in the mansion. Unfortunately, after a short period of good progress it started putting in lots of delaying features: Read a letter, meet the neighbors, give the neighbors tea, read a book, look for another book. At this rate I\'ll never get to see another room. So now that I reached the level where I would have to pay them if I want to win any more games, I\'m just going to uninstall.',
       'I have not been able to play for 3 days now. Everytime I log on I can not click the play button even after I go into the app and force stop. It is hard to level up and the power ups don\'t always work. I have also lost items after winning them. I do not recommend this game sadly because I did find it fun at first.',
       'I really like this game.  I would give it five stars if you change a couple of things.  We should be able to create our own character,  there should be a player code that we could type in to go to a friends mansion.  But other than those things this is a great game that is a lot of fun for all ages!',
       'Haven\'t been able to log in to play for two days now. It\'s like the game is stuck. I\'ve tried to force stop, restart my phone. Nothing works. I\'d hate to uninstall because I\'ve put a lot into this game. Please help!!',
       'I really like the game but some of the tasks are so annoying (take a nap, read letter, open book and stuff like this). Still playing it and still enjoying it. Will suggest more options for the furniture and definitely options if we don\'t want to put some of the things, to can take it away. Because the game is obligating us to put things yes or yes even if you don\'t want it. So for me would be nice to have the option for "new" one or "take it away".' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ],

It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',

     [ 'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'Good game. Though it could be better. Make range on weapons and protection when you have armor on. Then you should be able to unlock new settings besides the train. Multiplayer would be cool. Another (and the last) thing you could implement is a way for you to go back and beat the bosses you defeated already to earn money. Despite all the flaws I\'ve stated, it\'s a good game and time killer.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10' ],

     [ 'Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It\'s a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that\'s gonna work out. That\'s all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.',
       'The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don\'t want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s amazing and seems to be fun, but there\'s one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can\'t see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn\'t allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.',
       'Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol',
       'Thankyou gor being creative i wish you add more challenge : crash crush. That is like just crush using vlad and rufus (example) and then crush make them crush so who is the winner. Using that game we can know who is the stronger',
       'As much as I want to love this game, its also quite cheap. Every single race, the same "real" players are always there regardless of time of day. They follow the same route and incredibly make no mistakes at all! Meanwhile, I\'m getting stuck on every edge, my wheel gets stuck in the ground and every single gate smashes only me. Amazing!! Its a super fun game but don\'t think for a second that it plays fair.' ],

     [ 'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don\'t really care either way I\'ll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I\'d debating on installing it just get it. You\'ll have fun, trust me.',
       'Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.',
       'Until the previous update, everything ran fine. But now, with the Cream update, the game lags a TON. I get frozen on one frame while everything\'s still happening. I start off in first, then the framerate drops to 0 temporarily while I\'m bombarded with obstacles I can\'t see to do a thing about. Fix these performance issues and I\'ll put my rating back to 5 stars.',
       'To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I\'d like. You can\'t at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I\'d like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn\'t taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it\'s worth the $1.99 purchase I made.',
       'Love the game, but there\'s something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!' ],

       '3d camera the game is soooo cool but it is the camera. 3d camera is soooo emberrsing after awhile, the the game gliches.  i don\'t really understand the that a person on YouTube built a hot air balloon in the air. You can\'t do that. but, I still think that this game is very cool!!!! I give this game a 5 star even though my review is about the 3d camera.',
       'Happy, then let down. I loved the app. It\'s exactly like minecraft. However, After about an hour of game play it kept freezing up every 5 minutes or so. Every time it froze up I would have to exit to my home screen then re-enter.',
       'It\'s gr8 and all, but there are some things that I want. First is crouching, it\'s impossible to build bridges if I\'m always falling, Second is sound FX, for me it\'s too quiet and the fact of footsteps and moos and oinks and clucks is very good. Last IS everyone\'s game enemy, ADS, ads pop up in a few seconds and when building my first house you can forget what part you were on. PLEASE ADD OR FIX THESE THINGS!!!',

But can you add some skin in this game?this game sometimes show the chat but i don\'t know how to open the chat so please fix it.Oh, and please add some block and food in creative mode because it don\'t have or maybe it have but i think it don\'t have many of it.Please do it like in minecraft pe but not all of it.😊😀' ],

       'Last update killed it. Can\'t even see the bottom row to select anything. It\'s covered by an ad and the aircraft selection covers it as well and won\'t go away. Makes it unplayable.',
       'Paying doesnt remove ads, not worth it.  UPDATE 2/24/18, still no reconciliation from the developer on the pay scam. I\'ll be going to Google for a refund. I do not recommend this app.  This is a fun game - one you can pick up for a few minutes, or for an hour. I played it before the challenge modes and was still entertained. The ease of use combined with incresing intensity keeps you very engaged. Heres the catch - TOO MANY ADS!   I paid the $3 for an "no ads" experience, only to encounter the same ads that appear in game and after every round, and on screen. The only thing paying for it does is shorten the ad run time, so you can close them after about 5-10 seconds. I am not pleased about this and would not have paid for it if I had known.   Buyers beware...',
       'Way to many adds and when I paid to remove them they were still there. Tried to contact them and they never replied. Had to get a refund through Google play. Don\'t waste your time with this app.',
       'Hate this app because of too many advertisement. The game is good but too many advertisment make it worst cant play much because of it. Google play you should work on the advertisment.' ],

     [ 'Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It\'s best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it\'s been six months, and I\'m still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I\'ve only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.',
       'Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you\'re either going to have to pay lots of real money or you\'ll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!',
       'I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says "loading cantina" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!',
       'I played this on and off since it started but now I am back full-time and it has always been improving and growing. Big star wars fan and can\'t get enough of it? This is the next best thing. The game is very complex so I suggest if you are only starting out, check out starter guides on youtube on how to have the best head start  and enjoy! 🎉',
       'Really good game. I love games where you have to grind to get the best character with a slight bit of luck if you pull them. The only thing i would change is how long it takes to get your energy back as. I feel like when i run out i cant play the game gor a long time as it takes a lot of time to get your energy back. But overall would fully recommend',
       'My game had been freezing after last update. I ended up turning wifi off and using mobile data once it got to the update it asjed if i wanted to switch back to wifi. I did this turned off mobile data and it has worked now. On android hope this helps some other people out' ],

Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up.' ],

     [ 'It\'s like Cooking Mama from the Wii, but you don\'t have to be accurate at all. There are SO many ads. I mean... They send you an ad like every 30 seconds or so! It\'s a lot. Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it\'s not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.',
       'Good game but too many things locked and that makes it 3 star from 5 star. Please coco tab tale unlock the whole game. In competitions always I am third because things are locked. You know money is very precious can\'t spend on a game. Please please please please unlock things. Ok bakeries we will do but others you. And yes when I have not reached that bakery then the orders come in which they can be completed in other bakery only?😟😞',
       'Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don\'t have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.',
       'At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I\'m not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.',
       'This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don\'t have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don\'t be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... 😉',
       'Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that\'s all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much' ],

Maybe even unlimited mini game mode where you try for high scores. Not the hidden objects one but the one where you stack food and also the eating food one. The game crashed a couple times on me and froze but it was fixable by closing it and going back in.',
       'It\'s a great game fun to play. But you should also have some mini games to like where you have to stack the food or swipe bad items off the table. And you need to have more mysteries out as soon as possible because I was really getting into the game n I didn\'t have anymore to play',

     [ 'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'So honestly i love most of this game. However, you can notice that when gathering loot chests, there is a normal wheel of fortune scenario, with a decipherable pattern. However, if you look closely the game changes the options on the wheel if you come close to getting one of the better options. So instead of getting a 4 star superstar in big bundles you will get the crappiest 2 star superstar and in others you will get 150 cash insteadof a superstar. Ita ridiculous because that means that how much ever money you spend on the game, they rig it so you cannot win the bigger items.',
       'reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.',

My suggestion is that you can improve its value by adding entrance to the players or at least play their theme song after the game. I\'m tired of listening to the same music again and again. Plz do these changes as fast as possible. Thank you.',

     [ 'The puzzles are fun, but... I like these puzzles very much, but I have one minor quibble and one major complaint preventing me from giving this app a five-star rating. The quibble - the  language used in "do you want to quit yes/no" splash is Danish. Surely if you can offer puzzles in two languages, you can make the language in the exit splash match the language selected in Settings. The complaint - the ads are very intrusive. Forcing me to close a full screen ad every time I complete a puzzle is very user-unfriendly. If you must force ads on us, at least display them only on the bottom of the screen. Even better, offer a premium version/in-app purchase to eliminate the ads.',

     [ 'Great game. Loving it. I noticed when you go into the Alter, there is a note telling you your capacity limit at the bottom but in the Mana gem screen it doesn\'t tell you. Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',
       'Repetitive and too expensive.  When you try to do the side tasks to earn diamonds (in game currency you\'d otherwise spend way too much cash on) they find ways to not pay you. I\'m owed over 800 diamonds and they\'re telling me to contact someone else.  Absolutely not worth it.',
       'Every time there\'s an update you get thrown backwards X 10! I was movin along at a steady pace but now since the update I havent been able to advance 1 area! Even the arena battles arent winnable. Not fun at all anymore. This coming from someone who played religiously every day for 6 months or longer 👎',
       'Think I\'m the same as most people who have been playing for a long time. With the new update its just to much of a un-enjoyable grind for nothing when for all we know the game will update again and we\'ll be set back and have to grind all over again.',

     [ 'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Awesome It\'s a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)',
       'Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!' ],

     [ 'BEWARE. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME. I made the horrible mistake of spending money on in-game gold. I bought two wrestler packs with it, and on the second pack the game froze up, and I didn\'t receive the wrestlers. I entered a support ticket, and one person said oh ya the game froze & we can refund you. 10 mins later I got a second message from another person saying it did not freeze, and we can\'t do anything for you. The horrible staff will screw you over to protect their buggy ass game. BEWARE.',
       'I was enjoying it, but today has been a bit difficult. The game crashes once the multiplayer loads. It also crashes on occasion during story mode. I\'m sure it will get sorted eventually, so a I\'ll stick with it for now.',
       'My favorite game. Still upset with amount EXP gained during losses and also the lack of value in the packs offered is keeping my from giving a 5 star. I know I\'m a tough reviewer but that\'s all that is missing from this game. Play it. It\'s still a lot of fun',
       'Been playing since soft launch. Fun game with great art, tight mechanics, and really helpful devs. Multiplayer may br a little broken, needs more events to keep people playing.',
       'This game is hilarious and full of everything i want in a pro wrestling handheld game. The commentary commentary is the best part. I would give it 5 stars if I were farther in the game.',
       'I did lower on graphics only because I would like to see something a little more better and for game play I think it kinda sucks that you can only get certain gear on special matches not that I don\'t like the challenge so much but if I could buy gold with bucks that would make it so much better so I can try and get gear in the store instead of having to wait a few days if I miss the special match opportunity' ],

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can\'t find Bradinsky song. It\'s okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol',
       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',
       'When I saw that EA took on the game I immediately purchased it thinking it was any good. The graphics are good, but the controls are nerve-wrecking and the game makes decisions for you. It responds slowly and the block hold works by itself. These little things make you lose and make the game unplayable. Don\'t download it - free or not, look for another Tetris because this does no justice to the original',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.',

     [ 'I love this game. Unfortunately if you advance to far the performance breaks heavily, because there is just too much going on {I\'m on 10 assembly lines}. I\'d love to see bigger areas (so I can build a super computer per tick) and maybe a multi selector splitter 3 way to make my lines even better. But all in all this game kept me busy for hours and I love it.',
       'Suggestions: allow the game to run in the background while it is paused. Currently have to kill the app before it\'ll start the offline play. Not a big deal but I\'d like to continue gaining resources if I quickly go to another app. Also, a great feature would be a current statistics window. It could show current total electricity costs per machine type per second, amount of resources generated per second, amount of crafted items per second, and money gained per second per item. It would allow you to see which items are more efficient.',
       'Fun game and really cool concept. Could definitely be refined further and it would get 5 stars.   I\'m finding an issue with the $/s tracker in game. Either the tracker is off or something in the game isn\'t right. I have 3 washers ($1100 each) being sold every 2 seconds. That\'s $1650/s. But the tracker is reading between $650-$1000/s. Which is not even close to what it should be...',
       'Lost a lot of actual productivity making my fake assembly lines as productive as possible, loved every second. You can also make a simple but effective line, then leave it for a few days to make bank (assembly line keeps making money even while the phone is off). 4/5 because I lost all my progress by accident.',
       'fun game, I\'ve also seen user\'s suggestions added. no premium currency! ads are not forced, and in game payout for watching ads increases as you progress.   suggestions for improvement.  area select. 1 at a time takes awhile.  copy/paste area and line. you could also change more for machines to make it more fair.  erase assembly line  shipping and receiving docks for moving stuff between lines  customer contracts. this could make the game more engaging  a forum to discuss the game.  overall you have a good thing going here. I look forward to see where this goes',
       'This game is great. It\'s a ton of fun if you enjoy planning, automation and complex building. I was totally addicted, but after building my supercomputer factory I\'m kinda waiting for more content, recipes, or challenges. 2 thoughts - the control responsiveness and ui could use a bit of love, and sometimes the game randomly lags out until I restart. All in all though, I love it - 5 stars.' ],

And I LOVE how you can change the hair colors! the reason I didn\'t rate this game all of its stars is because, I can\'t find the pictures of the girls I made and saved, and you can\'t change the girls outfits, but don\'t let that stop you from getting this game because it\'s great!',
       'I I like it a little bit. but it needs more choices of the hat. I like changing  the hare. it is a very short game. so I am a little sad.',
       'I like game because we are free to create hairstyle in our own way there is no copy mode and i like that i think you should add more colors and some more accesories and hat for a complete look in game and last thing is add new accessories  and colors without deleting old ones they are also needed in game and KEEP YOUR GAME FREE SO WE CAN USE OUR CREATIVITY.',
       'I like it I do the best salon I can for the girls and my pics of them for when I finished r amazing but I think that there should be some boys in the game as well because I am a bit of a tomboy and boys are good in hair games and I think that there should be a shaver item so that you could cut of all the hair because I really want to cut of all the hair and do a complete redo ok',
       'Ii really like the graphics te music and yeah the game is really interesting and fun don\'t listen to bad reviews some people just want to tarnish their reputation and some maybe there is a problem with the game on their phone',

     [ 'Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.',
       'Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don\'t get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a "Create a Player" option under \'My Club\' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It\'d be so nice if you add that.',
       'It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player\'s data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player\'s stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player',
       'I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks',
       'Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the "First Touch" as fast as possible.',
       'Great game. Controls could seize to work at times (not very often though) but as a whole, it is a fantastic game. Quality graphics and game play. It would be nice if the game could auto-update(with internet connection) so teams could be updated and players could be at their current clubs e.g Coutinho (Barca), Alexis (Man utd ), Mkhritaryan(Arsenal)etc. Love this game' ],

Except the pieces of hearts on the screen are all right hand side pieces of the heart so none of them should count. Fix this',

       'This is edited Thought I hated it; but this game was so fun and thought provoking! The positive reinforcement hand clapping is great. Sometimes you really need it after a tough challenge. I frowned, I smiled and laughed. Would like to see more than a number for IQ. Maybe in a basic way what skills I\'m good at or need work on. It\'s all so enjoyable; not paying attention to skill building. I\'m telling everyone about this game!',

     [ 'I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It\'s a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don\'t mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It\'s the price you pay to get a good, free game. It\'s not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.',
       'It\'s a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I\'m not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.',
       'I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I\'m going to try another app now.',
       'I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn\'t like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.',
       'It won\'t allow me to add my own pic for background. Maybe too big of a file but I know other solitare let me. I also wish there wasn\'t commercials after the win or lose because they interrupt my music but I hear you guys make money that way so let it be. I\'ll continue to play because I like solitare and the commercials only pause my music and don\'t cut it completely off to play the commercial, like other apps.',
       'Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.' ],

Over a week after my initial review the game is still broken and has not been updated.   Loved game for the first week or so after I discovered it. Now it just crashes constantly no matter what I\'m doing in the game.' ],

My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it\'s the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!😀',
       'Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn\'t deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it\'s to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.',
       'Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!',
       'It\'s fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I\'ve failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.',
       'I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on "memory match" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it\'s worth installing.',
       'Hi, no support team is there, i have a problem- Not able to play Multi tasking game, its hanged - not scrolling after 3rd level, plz help me to play, need to complete tht game, other than this all r gud game to play.

I finally return to the game in full swing as you guys gave it more purpose. Giving premium cash from doing those rebellion defense (It\'s a one time thing) and I think that\'s cool. You added those power cards but they are a one time use which is kind of dumb. You cant upgrade heros with regular gold anymore , just with the premium  cash, which is equally dumb. You want to upgrade that bank? PREMIUM CASH. YOU CAN NO LONGER EARN NEW TROOPS OFF CONQUERED CITIES, YOU HAVE TO USE PREMIUM CASH TO BUY THEM. You guys take a step forward but steps back. Heroes should be upgradeable with the regular gold and new troops should be earned through conquest again.  If your reading this, SPEND DIAMONDS ON THE BANK FIRST. MAX IT OUT. DONT WASTE DIAMOMDS ON THE CRATES',

       'Your dictionary needs updated!!! Does it only have 50 words in it? Because when I find extra words the game has no clue. Most important, the puzzles won\'t let you spell the word. I spelled candle 50 times, used all the hints and it spells cand,..it won\'t allow me to put in l, e. !! Because there is another pre-used letter between.  Game sucks due to these reasons.',

The idea was to see if it was fun and interactive as well as giving her brain a bit of a work out/ stimulate recovery and memory. I found myself addicted to it so i downloaded it on my own phone too - even my step father is addicted ha! Its fabulous. I also recommend paying for the lowest package of \'hints\' because all packages remove the adds (which are the only down side to this game.

     [ 'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination.

It\'s not genuine, and it\'s just a plead for us to buy the ad removal thing.  Original: The core gameplay loop is cool. It\'s fun, I\'ll keep booting it up. But it would benefit greatly by a better tutorial. As someone else said before, the ball tends to fly off and lose momentum in ways I can\'t seem to figure out. Might be a failing on my part, but at times it feels like gravity changes the rules at random and I\'m left floating hopelessly as the void swallows me up.

     [ 'Good fun until you figure out that you only need to build area 52 up. At level 500 it jumps by 5000000% or something stupid. Meaning can clear a planet in just hours. Needs a different hook to it. After a few planets it\'s a bit stale.  The choices to buy in multiples of needs moving. With fat fingers I\'ve caught the research aswel as hitting Max a few times',
       'It\'s a good time killer. The thing that makes me think about deleting this app is how it keeps overriding my phone. I keep turning notifications off for this app, but the game will turn them back on again. It\'s so annoying to have my phone buzz just to find out its just this stupid game telling me my scientists are done or waiting for a task.',
       'Usual game where numbers get ridiculous and good at killing time. Very good features and well balanced - so far. Like with many of these games nearer the later stages the completion time can be calculated and nobody wants to tap for 211 years to complete the next round. Hopefully this game sidesteps that.',
       'Update to previous review: Devs seem on it. After the last update there seemed to be a bug or two. A couple of us let them know and they fixed it within a week. Good game, come and go on your own time, well maintained. Thanks guys!  --------- I\'d have to agree about the slow down for the red bacteria after the update. It used to come between 1.5 and 3 mins. Now I can go 10 minutes looking at the screen before one comes. It makes the game more of a waste of time than fun. Other than that, I was really liking it. Played it more than most games.',
       'Yes it\'s a tapper buy done is a very unique way and totally worth your time. The fact that your goal is to destroy planets and that you are sending all your energy to the planet makes sense that you have to start back up. Been playing for almost 3 months and I keep checking back in to destroy planets.',

     [ 'This is a wonderful, well made, fun game!  Also highly addictive.    Really enjoy it a lot.      With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, "puzzles".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).',
       'Why does this game keep freezing during play. I know this game has been on the play store for a long time now because I played it a year ago non-stop but now it is freezing. Come on dev\'s u have had plenty of time to work out the kinks. It shouldn\'t be freezing in the middle of play. Shame on u king dev\'s.',
       'I love the game, but i liked it more when the piggy bank had 100 gold bars. It was a fair price-amount report. Also, i would love to see more often the trick or treat and the win 14 challanges event. And yes, the new owl look is awful. Please change it back :-))',

I know longer get the daily award for some reason.  And you have to wait a long time for a new life (30 mins).',

     [ 'I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I\'m data only) and my tablet says the game isn\'t compatible. It\'s marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it\'s not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I\'m not running a speed test.',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻',
       'Love the game, would give 5 stars, but lost 2 high-level characters and quite a bit of $ due to lack of anything resembling customer service. If you have to reinstall for any reason, and can\'t remember your password, be prepared to lose all progress because if you can\'t sign in right the first time, there\'s no way to sign out, or to contact someone to help recover your character.',
       'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'Requires some patience but is a really fun game. Don\'t expect to fly through the tutorial but they make it fun learning the steps. What I enjoy the most, is its NOT lagging down my processor with ads. Only thing I wish is that the home base was a little more organized.' ],

The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'This is a great game that I\'ve played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it\'d still fun to play. My only gripe is that there\'s no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it\'ll be 5 stars all the way for me.',
       'Okay, so I got this game on my phone, and it was amazing! Very fun, very addictive, and overall just very enjoyable. But then I got it on my Samsung Galaxy E 8 tablet, and the game was stretched out to fit the screen. I don\'t mean just a little stretched out either, I mean so stretched that it made it difficult to actually enjoy the game as I was once able to. Thats why I gave the game such a low rating.... Please, please fix this though! I love this game so much, but this huge handicap is holding me back from being able to play the game and have fun. I\'ll just delete the app for now, since I can\'t even play it. But I\'ll redownload it in the future and hopefully the problem will be fixed by then. Until that happens though, I\'ll keep my rating on the game low. But don\'t worry, as soon as you fix it, my five stars will come back!' ],

     [ 'A surprising find, i really don\'t expected this game to have this level of quality. This game successfully give me the feeling of discovery and exploration while in expeditions, and i feel compelled to build and better the manor. But a disappointment is how there are no differences between characters other than their classes and aesthetics.',
       'What a surprising good game, somehow it manages to keep me up logging at it daily to train my heroes and do some quest, a thing that would be really amazing would be cloud support, so you can play the same savefile on two devices, didnt found any game breaking bugs and so far the game didnt pushed the shop into me which was nice. All in all a 4.5 out of 5. Can t wait to see this game evolve and age.',
       'Please add guild system and raid boss feature which u can fight with guild members. Absolutely love the game so far. Good job Leiting Games!',
       'I want to give it a higher rating because many aspects are quite good. However, seeing how much it costs to simply change a character\'s name (even for the first time) makes me realize this game will likely try to nickle and dime me even more later on.   There are some minor grammatical issues but nothing serious.   The game is reminiscent of Darkest Dunegon but it\'s different enough to be its own thing. Sadly, it tries to get greedy with my pockets more than I\'d like.',
       'Only reviewing because they offered me loot. Ik I don\'t have to actually review it, but oh well.',
       'It\'s a good game it\'s one you can overlook but you will miss out if you like old school dungeon crawling then give this a shot only downside for me is it crashes when I get a notification and I have to restart my phone which is a big problem' ],

     [ 'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'It\'s pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It\'s hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it\'s a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There\'s multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don\'t recommend this game.',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....' ],

     [ 'It would be a real good app if they didn\'t have so many ads popping up. Budge needs to reevaluate this because it\'s not making my kid want more games...its making her hate this game. It\'s not an effective strategy...and no parent would download another budge game after seeing one ad a minute.',
       '"drag and drop the broken bits into the right place" game locks up and little 4 year old girl cries. Now I know why these games get hacked by little sisters older brother. People get pissed. Enjoy your money budge!',
       'My kid loved this game. She got really into it and was loving every moment, but then a part of the game wouldnt let her do anything. It was a boss scene on a pinkie pie level and a drop and drag boss on a rarity level. The game simply wont do anything and hence she cant get any farther. This is frustrating as i paid for all the stuff for it as she enjoyed it so much and its beginning to feel like i paid for my kid to be sad. Please fix!',
       'Let\'s talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that\'s how money is made, but that\'s ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.',
       'AMAZING Now don\'t blame me for loving this, I know there is not many levels, too many ads, but this is very active for kids. It can make thier reflex better! Can season 2 just come out already?',
       'Don\'t buy anything in the app cuz it doesn\'t sinc with other devices and when you complain NO ONE responds back! This app won\'t get another penny from me cuz you\'re a rip off! And if it wasn\'t for my granddaughter liking ponies, I\'d delete the app all together! Seriously crappy customers Service!!!' ],

       'I\'ve never had this problem untill tonight. When I start a guild boss battle. It starts off fine. About 15-20 seconds into the battle. It goes super fast. Almost like a battle fast forward. Making me miss my skills useage etc. What the hell?',

     [ 'I\'m really enjoying this game - it\'s surprisingly advanced for an app. Plays very smoothly and looks pretty. One annoying thing is I get network connection bugs from time to time flashing up. They don\'t stop me from playing tho, so meh. Also, the way they match players together is sometimes pretty suss, ships that wipe you out in two seconds flat...or less... just shouldn\'t be matched with you. But, overall pretty great.',
       'After a while playing I feel a new ship is needed. A ship that is used to support and repair team. I also think an actual alliance base would be nice to use. Assault another\'s base to gain upgrades for alliance base could be rewards. I just feel there needs to be something else to do besides a match vs other\'s. Maybe even have tactical station\'s where player\'s occupy turrets so dual pilots can occupy a ship, each with roles to fulfill.',
       'It\'s a good game.  Three things I may add.  Every so often when you improve a ship , the app goes "improvement failed" yet but takes your coins. Bit frustrating. Secondly, the matchmaking can be at times frustrating too, you\'re getting wrecked in seconds by other very powerful ones.. And last thing , hey , the music of the game becomes straight boring and dull after a while. Add something , anything , Frank Sinatra  ffs , you got about 15 seconds of soundtrack in all this game..',
       'I really love this game, i made a donation to help the devs... i was expecting no more ads (unless i chose to watch videos for double rewards) I STLL GET ADS. i will leave rating at 2 stars until this stupid issue is fixed. Why force a paying member to watch ads. STUPID DO NOT SPEND MONEY',
       'Plays great, but I can\'t put my super heavy weapons in the super heavy slot. And all the players who two days ago were fighting two tier under me have ships now a tier above. I don\'t think this is real live gameplay.',
       'I love this game, i have been looking for a capital ship vs capital ship game for a while and this is s a great game. Its diffiuclt to level up but it is always fun. Although i am experiencing a glitch where my super heavy cruise cannon has been placed in one of my gun slots, and i cant place it back in my super heavy slot. Otherwise great game' ],

I could play this for a whole day and think 10 minutes just went by! I loved this app so much! Thank you for making a good app. Well... I have nothing else to say except It\'s amazing, I suppose I\'ll play it for another hour!   I Liked it!',
       'For what this app is, its full of adds. There are adds when you are playing at the bottom. Then every two or three selections ypu are blasted with 15 to 30s unskippable adds. Often loud vidoes wasting data. I do not recomend you download this blatant addware app. Its fun and novelty quickly gets replaced with advertisement. And you become a monkey watching adds rather than participating a very simple game of would you rather.',
