        "Das Quiz bricht mitten drin ab und funktioniert nicht mehr, musste App schließen und habe Fragen verpasst da bei Quizduell alle drei Fragen ja auf einen Haufen kommen, was übrigens sehr nervtötend ist und mir nicht gerade Lust darauf mach es öfter zu spielen. Und im großen und ganzen hängt die App sowieso sehr oft. Dafür das ARD soviel Geld hat, sollte man meinen sie könnten eine wenigstens mehr oder minder funktionierende App erstellen lassen. Schlechteste Game App die ich je hatte. Hoffe nach den ganzen negativen Reviews wird daran irgendwann einmal was verbessert.",
        "Live mitspielen funtioniert gar nicht",
        "Bitte mehr Notifications, wenn man dran ist, bzw ne neue Frage kommt. Beim Duell kann man vor der Finalfrage nicht zurückgehen, um sich den Spielstand anzusehen, häufig bleibt die App auch hängen....  Finde die App grundsätzlich gut, aber es gibt noch viele Kleinigkeiten und technische Probleme.",
        "Es werden keine Fragen eingeblendet, wieder gelöscht.",
        "Die App reagiert sehr zeitverzögert, was noch das geringste Problem ist. Teilweise darf ich gar nicht mitraten, weil die Frage mir nicht gestellt wird, teilweise wird die Frage nicht Mal eine Sekunde lang eingeblendet und dann war sie wieder weg. Punkte werden mir erst gegeben wenn ich die App neustarte. Die 2 Sterne gibt es für die Idee und die Sendung. Die Umsetzung ist sehr schlecht, bitte überarbeiten!   Edit: die angesprochenen Fehler habe ich jetzt nicht mehr bemerkt. Dafür trat ein anderer auf: mir wurde die Frage gar nicht gestellt und sofort rot markiert und ich konnte nachgucken was die richtige Antwort war (ohne das die tv-show schon soweit gewesen wäre). Nachdem ich die richtige Antwort wusste, wurde mir die Frage dann doch gestellt und ich konnte antworten. Punkte habe ich dann auch bekommen",
        "Die App ist im grossen und ganzen gut. Allerdings sind Fragen zum Teil einfach verschwunden, bevor man überhaupt die Antworten lesen konnte. Das ist sehr frustrierend besonders, wenn man die Arbeit weiss."

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",

Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "The game itself is fabulous. Cute farm. Good graphics. Good work on that front. Yet being a bit more generous with westbucks in game or making some things more payable with your coins. I get that games don't create themself. But I personally am more likely to pay for games you can actually play for a bit after doing a purchase. And I don't really get that feeling here. But none the less the game itself is a work of art 😊"

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun.

But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",

Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "This is the best game ever I saw for farming. It haves the controls amd graphics. But still theres problem that whenever I purchase any tractor and sell it after I want another tractor then I cant purchase it. The option of purchasing becomes blur. So please make it better. If I will not see any improvement than I will less the stars rated. Regards Jagdish Gadhvi",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "This game is very nicely done. Its a genius concept except the fact that u catch zombies to make it into something is really gross. I would preffer if you could lower the pri e of the drone a bit so that there would be more play time rather than waiting play. Overall this game is superb",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested."

        "This is a great tool for your toddler (and fun for parents). I did pay the 1.99 to stop the ads but so worth it.  For under $2 my daughter has memory games, puzzles, fingerprinting, math, music, matching,  and the list goes on.  I spend at least $10 on a toy and for $2 it teaches and helps on long car rides and planes rides.  It's a great educational app and not a \"game\".  I would recommend especially if you're a fan of Masha and the Bear."

And then there is that glitch that happens a lot of times when you try to start a race and it uses your fuel but never starts, and that happens consistently. Please consider fixing the problems.",
        "I first got this game because it seemed interesting and whatnot, but I then completed the tutorial and went on to race other people but when I pressed the race button, I lost 20 energy but I didn't go on to race anyone or do anything else really. I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",
        "I really wanted to like this game and it's a great game don't get me wrong but it seems like you can't really do anything in there without watching and ad or buy something. I hated how the are so pushy with micro-transactions!",
        "Too many adds and too many game load fails, loose upgrades all the time due to this. Of which there are too few to begin with. In my opinion this needs to run seamlessly too keep a player engaged as the graphics and game play are so incredibly basic.",

It makes me think that you're not receiving enough money from your offers. Oh, and by the way, your offers are terrible. Nobody is going to buy things fairly priced. We want bargains, and less advertising."

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

Every time i defeat a opponent in a mission the game halts after \"you win\". I tried this with other missions as well but things didn't work. Please fix this bug.",
        "It is impossible to level up with sidemissions which come once in seven hours and the game is tough as hell. My xp bar was three fourth full and suddenly it became one fourth game matching is also insanely inaccurate. Results not loading game is crashing",
        "Why did I became so weak after the update? This really affected my weapon's and armor's strenght. I already lost 200 points just from losing to those I can usually defeat before the update.",
        "I had successfully updated to latest version i.e, chapter-4 but when i won the first match of chapter 4, the game stuck without showing any rewards. And it stucks there forever until i close the game and then restart it again it again show the first match and again i won but still it stuck. Please do something for it.",
        "Good graphics, good controls and in theory, good sequel. Unfortunately the gameplay is obviously tilted towards the pay to win scheme, which means that non paying players will have to grind for days just to advance one step in the main quest. That makes this game excruciatingly slow at times.",
        "Awesome. But I'm here to share the review about what's not working after this update. Bugs are inevitable so i hope this is resolved soon. After the first battle in chapter 4, the screen freezes. I win the battle but everytime the app hangs and i have to repeat the battle."

Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards. You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I'm not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won't make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.",
        "The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app",
        "WAY too many ads.  play 30 seconds, then watch a one minute ad.  Dont really know if i would like the game or not, i never got to play much of it, spent most of my time watching and trying to closeout ads.",
        "First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕",
        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver."

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Not for those who want a almost free game.  Of course the developers need to make money, but I think this game goes overboard.  In order to advance in the game at a rate that keeps you interested, you must pay.  Not very balanced."

You have to aim like 30 feet above your opponent and hope that you are lobbing the knife high enough to make it there. Sometimes I would somehow win a round without even throwing a knife. Other times I'd die in the first second of play after being hit 1 time but it would take me at least 3 hits to kill my opponent. Watched a video for a free crate and then the game went back to the startup screen like it was rebooting and i had to watch another to open it. Not very much to do either. Im out.",

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

So ive had to uninstall. I'll never know if this game was good or not because i never got to play due to ads!  People are saying  'pay to remove ads if you dont like it '   well we should have to pay to remove ads on a free game.. whats the point in saying its free when really it isn't because you have to pay to remove ads in order to play the game!!!",
        "Good game but enough with the ads. Way too many and way too long. The ads are longer than the game play. Ine ad was over 30 seconds long. You guys obviously do not read these comments or reply to any of them. This could be a great game.",
        "The ads are excessive. There is an ad at the bottom of the screen at all times, and after every single attempt at a level, I was getting an unskippable 30 second ad. Some I had to participate in to close out of. Not cool. Not worth it. Game concept is funny, though. I just know I wouldn't play it enough to bother paying for ad free.",
        "Love the concept, but it doesn't work at ALL. I downloaded it, and no matter what I do, nor how absolutely silent it is, the chicken is running and jumping and I have zero control over it. Super disappointed--hopefully it's just glitching?? I wanted to try it, but neither sound nor silence give me any control over it 😣"

I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",

        "Fun until you get to Miami.. absolutely impossible to make 100 000.00 to unlock the next level.  Computer outbids or up bids you so that you either give up or lose your money.  No daily incentives to keep brining you back.  Unless you are willing to spend real money for boosters and money to move on.. play to Miami and then delete.. impossible to move forward after that.",
        "The game was addictive and fun until you get to Miami. 100k to unlock that level is absurd and unrealistic. Its to hard to make that kind of money playing and now its just playing the same level over and over trying to get enough. Now its boring!! I'm disappointed, I really enjoyed playing until that point.",
        "Was a great game until I got to Miami level 19 now just bloody stupid & waste of time. I went to 4 straight auctions couldn't buy a unit because competitors bid more than what the units worth how are you suppose to level up & move on when the designers of the game make stupid unrealistic flaws in the game no bidder is going to bid in real life on items they can't see or know are there so why put this into the game? Fix this issue & I will adjust my review accordingly!",

        "This game activitly makes me angry. I want to keep playing it but the longer I play the less accurate my ship becomes, eventually missing EVERY SHOT, EVERY TIME. It feels likes the longer you play the game the less effect your ship becomes. It's a fun game but seems like a pretty intense cash grab.",
        "Decent, not good. Enemy flags might as well not exist as they don't fight eachother. You'll end up getting swarmed by every ship that always go faster than you, no matter how much you upgrade speed. They ram You constantly dealing damage but then take no damage from when you ram them. They also aren't affected by friendly fire. You can't actually aim and the constant ads are very annoying.",
        "Easy to play game. Good graphics. Controls can be a bit fiddly, but not that hard to deal with. If playing solidly for a while (30+ minutes), the cannon firing timing stops working properly and all shots miss (except for the enemies!) - restart the game and problem resolves, but a frustrating little bug.",
        "This game is amazing. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played on mobile. Also, you don't need to spend any money! I got to a fully maxed out ships without spending a cent. One thing you guys should add is multiplayer and different style ships, maybe Viking or something. Otherwise great game.",
        "Well I get the concept, but it's just not intriguing enough yes there's fishing, battling, etc. to top it off you get to sail in a really small map & after just 10-15 min I found it quite boring! Nonetheless just create a bigger more diverse map & fix those controls & this game could potentially be a 3 star game."

If you like this, dont whine just pay the piper or play something else.  Develepers have to eat, ya know???  If you want a free alternative, (or if you are curious about how this stuff works) i suggest looking into the open processing language.  You can learn to make your own cool stuff like this by finding a couple of algorithms online   Also, if you have a good graphics card in your pc/mac and you are interested in this stuff  check out touch designer.  You can make some really amazing realtime art  But seriously, support these developers if you like the program.  Its that simple.  99 cents is not much money!!  Ok luvya byebye",

So please fix that problem. Thank You. Fix the problem right now!!!!!! Fix It!!!!!! I hope you Game Shakers heard me So all you have to do is raise that time limit or just make us have them permanently. One or the other. So just choose One!!!!!! OK? Good I hope you heard me. Good.

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun.

        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "OK I really love this game but all if a sudden I can't play it anymore. I try to set up a match and it just hangs in the loading screen then boots me to the main menu. I have sent 2 emails to support within almost a week and more than 48 hours apart. I have not received any responses. Other than that it is a great game and for the time I was able to play I enjoyed it very much and hope to receive assistance in this matter soon so I can continue to play this wonderful game.",
        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy."

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.",
        "Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!"

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it.",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory.

Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",
        "Lack of game play is what gets me. Don't get me wrong, it's a smart tactic. Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",
        "It was a good game. Too bad it doesnt open now after the update. It says something below the logo screen and then dissapears too fast you cant read it. And when it goes to the gear connecting thing to try to connect it crashes.",
        "Can you guys pls fix the game because when I started to play then while its loading THE GAME GOT CRASH! The oldest version work for me but this version it didn't work. Thx to read this.",
        "It's a great game, it has good graphics and awesome cars. But one thing that I don't get after I have downloaded it why do I still need to purchase it.... really that's not cool....if people found out about this they may end up uninstalling the app....if only you could give it to me for free."

        "I think it is a great idea for a quick game to play when you ate board but  way to many ads. Like every time I missed one of the pink things it would bring me to an ad. If this sounds really formal we are working on constructive feedback in school right now.",
        "Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.",
        "Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.",
        "It a great game but I have a small issue.    Nearly every time I open the app it comes up with this pixilated, almost, screen for about 30s. (I have a screen shot of it) it didn't do this when I first downloaded the game so is this something I've done wrong, my phone or the programmers? Please reply because other than that it a great game.",
        "Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it."

        "Before the update, you were able to put your Tamagotchi to sleep and then exit the app. With the latest update, you can't do that. I liked the opportunity of exiting out the app while my Tamagotchi is sleeping so that I don't have to wait awhile for his energy to refill. I've exited out of the app three times after putting him to sleep and three times, I had to return to put him to bed again. PLEASE fix this because I liked it before the new update.",
        "I paid for the starter pack which says it will remove the mandatory ads but guess what, ads are still there. Please do something about it and I will change my ratings.  Edit after reply* wow not even an apology for someone who paid. Kind sir, then please at least let your consumers know that there are actually 2 kind of ads instead of just simply stating 1? No Tom dick or harry will know that unless you state it. Good day.",
        "The only issue i had is the back button when tamagochi sleep. It make auto-wake state when i push the back button. It would be nice if even i push the back button tamagochi still sleeping instead wake up and also option for how long they sleep like 4,6,8 hours. I'll change the rating after the back button issue has fix. Btw the game is good, you should add adventure or something like that.",
        "Good nostalgia, awesome graphics but needs better execution. Allow optional interactivity with friends, for example. The main point of using a smartphone is connectivity. Make earning anything easier, this will increase the replay value. Your game will become popular by word of mouth, I tell you. Don't make it a quick cash grab. Think about how you can keep the game afloat instead of having to scrap it and start anew if it fails.",
        "I did a YouTube video over this app. Overall Tamagotchi Forever is fun. But ads and lack of things to do made this app a miss opportunity for the creators. I do like optional ads. But the ads at the top and in between screens are lame. Also for an app like this cosmetics are the perfect thing to add, but they limit the costumes to about 3 each character. Another nice thing that would've been cool to see would've been decorating your house & visiting friends. These other things would've made the app great.",
        "I can't see ur advise is helping me, none of them. Back button will appear after i press phone's back button. And it makes my pet wakes from his sleep.  And yes, we can collect all of the character but we can't interract with other player, we ONLY can collect and evolve them, not like in tamagotchi v7 if u know what i mean.  Unistalling this game"

Perhaps i used bad tracks but its nothing like rockband blitz. It cant decide jf it ants to be a car racing game or a rhythmic game doesnt succeed at either. Looks neat at least. But hard to tell where tongo next with most graphics",

I love how you guys do the ads. If there's a car or level I want and I want to be lazy, I can just watch a couple ads to get it. Not only that, but It's my music. What a great idea. Kudos. I'm 100% on board.",

The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate [150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is \"strictly Russian\" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)]!

        "Hasn't even been 10 seconds into the game before it shut down 🤣 - I thought it would be different for me as I have the S8+. Obviously NOT. The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn't much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.",
        "Let's be honest here. The concept was very creative and unique, but the game was very poorly designed. The slide is not smooth and   feels very unstable, I wasn't able to enjoy playing the game. The graphics are very low and the game itself is slow. Apart from that the idea was very well thought of but I feel you should have added more time and professionalism into the whole design, the game has potential.",
        "One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don't really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...",
        "I really like this app but the the amount of ads are crazy! Wayyy too many. On a good note, the personalisation. I really like the different range of balls and the night time vortex, where everything stands out, and is all black. The trails are really neat too! Although the ball is quite sensitive when dodging around the obstacles. It is still great! I got a score of 104 on my second go! I'd definitely recommend this app! Also i have the samsung galaxy s4 so you can definitely 8nstall this if you have the same phone as me!😊",
        "It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.",
        "It's hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I'll be doing fine but it'll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I'd love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks."

It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can't use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.",

There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great game with good potential. I love it. But there are still some minor bugs the car baler somtimes acts weird. And the dismantling process sometimes goes reverse. And then there is the part of collecting building materials. It is too hard and we need to be able to get building materials from elsewhere than the scrap cars. All of them including wood, bricks, and concrete. I am looking forward to the car repair function.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly"

I have nothing else to say except It's amazing, I suppose I'll play it for another hour!   I Liked it!",

Often loud vidoes wasting data. I do not recomend you download this blatant addware app. Its fun and novelty quickly gets replaced with advertisement.

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "Way way WAYYY too laggy. It's an easy casual game though. I wouldn't say it's \"fun\" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That's it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there's no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.",
        "I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that's what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become."

After some good hours it get's really repetitive... Right know it feels like nobody takes care about rhis game anymore. No more patches, updates, no new stuff. It's a shame. This game has some potential but it's getting wasted here.",

I really do like this game but like I said I might not have it that long because there is not much to do on it I need the premium stuff! Thank you for the hard work on this game but it is not enough to satisfy me fully, anyway let me know what's up!...",

Also I didn't get one thing , in 'tips and tricks' it says 'rotate the sandbox and the horizontal toolbox exposes 40+ tools and materials'. How can I rotate it?",

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

        "Shows promise but needs tuning. The cars steer/turn so inconsistently and just wobble. The train and car tunnels come out so last minute they often cannot be dodged. Aside from this it is a good game.",
        "This game would be awesome,  absolutely killer, but there are way too many ads. I know ads are a necessity, but one ad after every driving attempt is overkill. Especially when the ads can't be backed out of.",
        "Number of ads drove me mad. Make instructions clear for first timers.",
        "Car handles way too bad to deal with so many obstacles. Turns game from fun to frustrating, and since ads pop up just about every time you wreck there's WAY too many. Game has potential but needs improvement.",
        "It's cool 2ould like to see more goals and such to aim for or records like how many times you shot your guys body through the arch of a bridge or something like that"

        "All of this is absolutely amazing. I have social anxiety, and the first time I played this (which was minutes ago) helped me so much. I could simply get lost in my own little world- or should I say oasis- for a while so I can calm down. Also the little messages are very sweet, and I love the artstyle! All in all this is a fantastic game, I wholeheartedly love it. C:",
        "I like it a lot but I only wish I could turn off the SFX for tapping and leave the BGM and ambient noises (like rain from the weather and rain cloud) on. Other than that, the ads are subtle and unobtrusive, the bonuses reasonably helpful for the cost, and the shop is nice (but unnecessary! You can enjoy the game without it. )",
        "Ads, ads and more ads. Rated family friendly but ads include electric cigarettes and lottery. Not exactly family friendly. The game is based on tapping to gain hearts to buy things to gain more hearts. Neat except it's nearly impossible to avoid the ads, which seem to be nothing but electric cigarettes and lottery ads (more than 6/10). Even when you're trying to play without ads, you will inevitably tap one of those inspirational messages from one of the animals or plants and launch an ad.",
        "I really love the inspirational phrases that pop up randomly. It really changes my mood when I read one. The only thing is that I wish this could have a journal section. Where I could write thoughts down or a gratitude journal where you write 3 good things that happen today and you could double your hearts. It would help level up the land faster and for people that are using this as a pick me up app. It would help us put our thoughts down all in the same place. :)",
        "I've only been playing this game for about 30 minutes and I can already say this game is one I'll be playing for a long while. I have a job interview coming up and boy does this relieve my anxiety! The little bubbles of encouragement is a very nice touch! They make me feel warm and fuzzy.",
        "The Ad. we're too long to enjoy the game! Sometimes it shows that I should rotate the screen to display Ad. but I have rotated the screen and cannot resolve the situation. All I can do was press the home button ànd kill the process fróm recent APP list then relaunch the APP."

        "Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it's fun and ever since the first play I've been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don't change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.",
        "Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don't have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!",
        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.",
        "THIS GAME IS RIGGED FOR YOU TO WIN. All you have to do is not die. I literally just played a game without rolling over any boosts and still won. The bots are programmed to let you win and just die before the end. This makes the game too easy and not fun to play."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Not for those who want a almost free game.  Of course the developers need to make money, but I think this game goes overboard.  In order to advance in the game at a rate that keeps you interested, you must pay.  Not very balanced."

If it was cash not gold i would give it 5 stars in an instant",

They were both endless loops of surveys and information mines, and never was given my promised reward after completing the initial survey. This is very dishonest and extremely annoying.

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Good Naval Battle game.  Graphic is good. Aiming seem realistic. Team oriented.  Still need some adjustments( such as full salvo Battleship rounds hits can't even cripple a DD).  Missing some mechanism like ammo rack damage. But over all, it is a good game although not as balanced as PC version."

What really turns me off to this game though are the push notifications. For one, why does a game like this even NEED push notifications. Secondly, to then make me unable to disable said feature is ridiculous. So 1 star out of sheer prinicple",
        "I remember playing an older version of this game called \"Bridge Constructor\" & I'm afraid this new version makes me feel nostalgic for the old one. The scoring system is purely financial (it used to consider how stable the bridge was as well). The game seems to want to get you to build the bridge how it wants you to build it. Creativity is discouraged.",

As an educational application, this presents an excellent opportunity for individuals to learn the basics of civil engineering.  I sincerely applaud the developers.",

You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and – most of all – adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car. Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won't be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.You will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don't want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!In addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.The game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you've built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.Realistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don't let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!Game features:- Superb physics - a true simulator - Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds- State of the art realistic graphics- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won't get bored as you build - Spectacular special effects- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic - Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor - Built-in hint system helps you build your skill",

The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don&apos;t want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!<br><br>In addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.<br><br>The game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you&apos;ve built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.<br><br>Realistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don&apos;t let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!<br><br>Game features:<br>- Superb physics - a true simulator <br>- Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds<br>- State of the art realistic graphics<br>- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won&apos;t get bored as you build <br>- Spectacular special effects<br>- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic <br>- Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor <br>- Built-in hint system helps you build your skill",

        "Fun game until you get to a level where you have to pay to move on. Minimum diamonds needed to delete tough lines is 200 And you can only earn diamonds 5 or 10 at a time. Need to be able to earn diamonds faster.  Even if you purchase diamonds the pricing is exorbitant.  Way out of line with other games. Update: don't waste your money to update to a better ball. It does no good and actually makes the game harder.",
        "I wish I could say this was a great game, I love brick games like this one but unfortunately this one is still buggy. For some reason everytime I try and Shoot To the Left it releases before I take my thumb off and completely screws up my shot. Does not seem to happen as much when shooting to the right side of the screen. Especially annoying when I have one block left in the warning Zone. The aiming is also an issue. Fix these issues and I will absolutely love this game.",
        "Simple. Fun. No intrusive, annoying ads that force you out of the gameplay, jyst a simple bar at tge top I was actually inckibed to look at because I FELT like giving sonething back because I was enjiying the game. All games shoikd be like this. Try firce ads diwn our thrists, we will uninstall and play sonething else. Which is how I found this gem. Well done people, excellent spin on block breaker.",
        "Game was fine until level 319. It stopped being fun after that. I took over a month of building up power ups before beating it. Only to find out 320 was almost the same design. Started fun... ended tragically.   Uninstalled."

However, it's still missing something and at the end it'll get boring fast. Overall, I kinda like the game and the pixel art.",

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

        "I really like the game. I got hooked on it. I didn't like that I had to pay to unlock the other levels especially since the game was so short. I passed every level within 3hrs. It was daeasy and fadt. Wish there were more levels. To unlock the levels it was kind of expensive.",
        "You should be able to earn what it takes to up grade.. You don't get very far in the game to even see if you really like it.. Your just stuck",
        "I love this game I love this game and I'm a boy wow this is so cool like there's no like ads and it's crazy how it is like you can make lots of treats and you can tell the customers to come up and get their traits and the love it I'm sure can tell them to come get the tree and they're really loud seriously they'll be the best traits that ever tasted",
        "This game is really awesome. I would have given it 5 stars. But it includes app purchases and you need to pay for upgrading. That thing I really didn't like. Thus I have given it 3 stars",
        "For anything over the basic you have to pay for it. Even after getting 3 stars on everything to go to higher levels you have to pay that's ridiculous. .."

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",
        "One of the dumbest cod ripoff i have seen and played in 2k18 so far. You need 20 bullets to kill someone with head shot. Dont waste your time with this dumb game. Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."
