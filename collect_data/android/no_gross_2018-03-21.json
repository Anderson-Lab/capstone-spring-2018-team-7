        "It's okay. The graphics are endearing. Controls and gameplay are smooth and easy to understand. A freemium game to be sure. It openly offers over-priced items like they are a great deal (they aren't). Most of it's purchase items are more expensive than other games. It has a gem subscription but for only 10 days, most simular games offer it for the full month for the same price, while offering more gems.",
        "OMG THIS IS AWESOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING THE GRAPHICS AND CONTROLS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT!!!!!! Except for the part when you raid somebody and the opponent's team always kills you before you kill them. ANYWAYS IT'S STILL THE BEST keep the updates coming IT IS SO FUN DESPITE NOBODY I KNOW EXCEPT FOR MY FAMILY EVEN KNOWS IT EXISTS GREATEST GAME EVEEEERRRRRR!!!",
        "Multitude of heroes to make your team. Not stingy about giving the player stuff. Potential fun for all, as casual game. Has PvP elements. Energy bar system replenishes when level up and even progresses in size as you advance. Should not be an issue until you get farther in, random energy gains also occur on maps with a little luck. Short tutorial at game beginning is torture to endure but is over in under 5 min. Great free game!",
        "Love the game so far. You could say I'm a try hard because I've only been playing the game for a month and a week and I'm already level 52. With 100% win rate and 83% defense rate  have one of the best teams in the game. And like I said before love it so far but for the next update. You'll should add friendly battles. Such as battling with your friends, clan mates, random players. Etc.",
        "Pretty fun game but I had an issue happy pretty quickly into the game and I'm hoping devs see this and help out.  I bought ten common portals for the 100k gold, after opening the first one the game decided to crash and I am no longer able to redeem my 9 other chest. I change to 5 star if we can this resolved. Thanks",
        "Hi, I don't know if it is a hack or what BUT even if my defenders WON then still it minus my POINTS and it shows that I LOST? Whereas the replay is different. And morover Aria's sand in eyes should also provoke the target. And legendary heroes are sometimes not getting worth. They need Interesting passives. Thx. Plz reply üòò"

A lot of horses in games I have seen have disporortionate bodies and are, over all, very unattractive.  The art style is similar to Spirit. Which was a big head-turner for me.",

When are the problems going to be fixed. This is worse then my beta tester games. Very unhappy also don't expect Ubisoft to help u",
        "I'm playing this game for almost two years, and never get bored. I uninstalled a lot of game's on this time except Horse Haven: World Adventures. At this moment I think we need a Grand Stable for fantasy land, and another land for exclusive horse's, they are so much now on the game. Thank you Ubisoft for this awesome game. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "I would definitely recommend this game to horse lovers. However, it doesn't satisfy me and the quite some Dutch players since it has our neighbouring countries Germany and France but not our own. It feels as if our country is just being neglected. It would be great if someone could do something about this issue.",

        "It's a great game, I love that I get to interact with the horses and the graphics is good then only down fall is I can't earn money that much and you run out of it quick, and you can't make enough for crops or upgrading, since you have to upgrade alot to get food for the horses."

Has caused me to not play for a day or two because of this but also what makes me come back it offers that challenge that is often lost in most games like this where is the fun of there is no risk. Not to many tedious tasks after about day 5 no longer logging in every 3 hours to start a build project or something.",

        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.üòíyou either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points."

        "I was writing about an issue today, and with next time I have looked to see if the issue is resolved, it was.  Thank you for this amazing and wonderful game.  I had been playing this game for almost 4-5 years already.  With my issues being resolved I would say I love this game so much.  Much recommended.  üòò",
        "I have waited 30min to see the gameplay after started the game. Very confusing.Bla bla, shiny things all arround, see this, take those, listen to the story and chose your 120lvl character. What is the point for new players to start from 120 lvl? How this can be fun?But never mind, I never understood the games which do that. Sorry, but I didnt find this game interesting for me.",
        "Wow, what do I think? I think this game is all hype took 4hrs plus change to download the game after installing it so to even play it was a joke, then when I finally was able, it froze on the log in screen and took me back out to my home page on my phone screen, only to then tell me the game had not been installed!!! Yeah clearly it is as it's taken up space! Not very good I'm not happy, I will try again before uninstalling this game if I manage to get in the game, obviously the review will change get but until then it's 1 star ass I can not go any lower. Sorry game makers!",
        "I wonder if there will be transcended busters in the future. Or perhaps the current arch buster will be the 'warrior' type and there will 1 of each type for us to mount. Looking forward to the overlord release though!",
        "Love the game been playing for over 2 1/2 years. Only one probably lately and that is my WB scores have been down substantially along with other users. I dont understand how going from a few archs' to having 6 and new gear makes my score down 14 trillion? Im bot the only one this is happening to so im a bit confused on what the problem is. Other than that great game play it everyday. Just dont like losing rewards on my wb% when it should be higher.",
        "After massive update and huge changes, I have to change my rating from 2 to 5.Such a big improvement toward all player,either f2p or whales.Congrats Gamevil, hopefully the community will grow as we see now in this game itself."

        "This game is quite good. The graphics are pretty nice for a kid's game, and I do appreciate how there are vents to win power up. That is a very nice update. It seems like Disney took the kids element a little more into consideration.  The later stages do get understandable harder. But after the 100th stage is almost impossible for kid's standerard, but I don't mind it since other games do the same thing.",
        "The game WAS great..spin the wheel, watch an ad, get a gameplay reward.  Great. But OMG now there's an BETWEEN squares AND for  rewards??!!! After you refused to give me back lost features  & said \"Disney had NO INTENTION of doing that in the future\", I had to think whether to uninstall the game, or suck it up & gimp along. Think you guys made the decision for. Too bad, I really enjoyed the game. Thx for what USED TO BE fun.",
        "This may not mean much to most. After suffering from a head injury, my memory was terrible. Level 250, memory coming back strong. I play daily on 2 devices. Just wish you could win gems, you have  to buy them except 22 in beginning. All in all 3-4 stars.",
        "I love love love this game!  BUT....THE ONLY THING I HATE IS THAT YOU CANNOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS...IVE HAD TO REINSTALL THIS GAME 3x's AND LOST ALL PROGRESS! Maybe if i wasn't on level 280 it wouldn't be an issue! You should have this as a feature by now! UGH! üò†üò≠",
        "Impossible to save or synchronize progress! As mentioned in many other reviews, it is not possible to save game progress, even if you link to your Facebook account. App support website confirms this functionality is simply not supported. Absolutely unbelievable. Just unbelievable. Don't waste your time on this game - it really will be _wasted_ time.",
        "This is a great game and you can have fun for hours. I'd rate it 5 stars if a few things were changed. First, you need to be able to sync on other devices, especially if connecting to Facebook. I have other games that sync, no reason why this game can't get with that technology. Just got a new phone, was at level 346, and now have to start over on new phone. Luckily old phone will still be used. Second, it's impossible to earn gems. There should be special events to earn gems. Yes, you can spin to win, but the odds aren't in your favor to earn them. Third, there should be more opportunities to earn helps. The event to pass 5 levels is extremely difficult and there aren't many other opportunities to earn helps. I'm not spending money on this game. Take tips from Farm Heroes! Overall, this is a fun game and the graphics are cute."

        "Played this on PC, and really enjoyed it for its simple, quirky playstyle. While it does trail off at the end when you've mastered everything, the entertainment value is still strong. Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "This game should be avoided. They don't care about what the players think and refuse to make improvements or adjustment players suggest. Progress is slow and even if you spend real money your odds of getting what you want is low.  Avoid starting at a costs. It is not worth your time.",
        "It is impossible to have a good team without spending lots of money.  In order to have a good team you need 4 star level robots which even when you do get a chance to get one, you will end up with a duplicate which will be liquidated for just about nothing. Hence better players get better and lower level players stay at the bottom. Also players that spend alot tend to get better chances on draws that are supposed to be random. Wow that's a surprise",
        "This game is a lot of fun. Great time killer. The only thing I think could be improve is the fact that you can't upgrade your bots with duplicates you get in the space bridge. And possibly better mechanics to see the bots you have walking around your base. Other than that. It's amazing.",
        "Slow, VERY SLOW You have to wait for everything.  After each battle, the Autobots need 7 minutes to recover for the next battle, but I have enough fuel for battle.  And, as your robots get more stars, the more you have to wait.  So it is about 20 minutes per game for me. Slow  Then if you accidentally switch to another apps or shut the screen off for a second, you will have to wait for the game to reload for another 2 or 3 minutes.  slow  Graphics is beautiful, but story suck, and wait time is horrible",
        "Updated. Games are supposed to be fun, if u play this game be prepared for a complete lack of respect for its user Base from the devs and a lack of fun events. Even those spending 1000s are bored  Don't start spending as the game is dying Don't expect good support from the game makers either who seem to be on a mission to put off it's older users to the point of stopping them playing the game. Ps dont expect many players as a deception. Pps #saveferal",
        "First off, if you do not want duplicates, do _not_ spend any money on anything other than maybe another builder bot and don't waste any of your cyber coins on crystals until you get all of your builder bots.   So long as you don't care about getting dupes the game is fun. And you will get so very many many many dupes, often times the same bot in a row. Fortunately, the somewhat new cores help take away the pain of getting dupes.  Personally, I enjoy the strategic and alliance parts of this game a lot and the events are fun so long as you don't care about placement on the leaderboard. Having a good alliance helps a lot by the way. Don't be afraid to look around for ones that boot leaches."

I didn't give it a 5 stars because of some of the programing actions available. The waypoints are sometimes more trouble than they are worth. The programmation is limited to 24 hrs. A ruler would be very useful for projections over 24 hrs. But I am enjoying myself, even if my wife doesn't understand why I should wake up at 4 am to check my course.",
        "A good improvement. My only beef is it cost money to change your boat colour. Be prepared to spend if you need to win. Find a few friends to race against and have fun without spending. Since last update keeps eating auto sail cards but only stays on for a few mimutes",
        "Getting close to perfection, need to keep the update of wind to closer to ugrib actual, but very happy with true effect and updates, like the new features of wind display, much better for present and future course determination.  Please look to make driving dial a bit larger, and a bit less sensitive, and possibly a 1 degree up or down feature, like the arrows  but a +1 or minus 1, as feature on present dial is too sensitive and does not adjust so refined.  From a Canadian point of view, can you look to include some races like Vic-maui, Transpac or even more amazing and local to west coast of North America, races such as Swiftsure or Southern Straights... short but very technically sweet races that are very challenging.",
        "Shame you can buy your way to the front of the fleet otherwise good fun.  So I have crossed the finish line 3 time but just keeps saying I have run aground ?? Hopeless",
        "Is lots of fun and surprisingly addictive.  I do mostly just the Volvo Ocean Race.  Would be nice to have an option to overlay exclusion zones.  Don't need to be enforceable, but more fun for those trying to beat the actual fleet.",

I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter.

This actually isn't valid as I just looked at each option to buy and none give the option of no ads. Plus I've made purchases and still nothing. I just updated the app and received the option of no ads. I clicked it and paid to no avail. Email has already been sent about it.",
        "I really love this game. I downloaded it for mindless stress relief in between classes and it has not disappointed. Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",
        "Hi there! I love this game! Im on level1839 and my hubby says i have a problem bahaha. The only thing ive noticed is the levels seem to have stopped introducing challenges and are sometimes just not possible to beat without serious coin. But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",

        "While its addicting its quite easy. I've gotten 3 stars on every level and I've played over 200 levels already. Ive only had to replay a level that failed 3 or 4 times.",
        "This was fun... Until level 100 when they take away the ability to switch colors of the ball you're shooting. It makes it too difficult. I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall."

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "It's a fantastic game, nothing less than what I'd expected. The graphics were fantastic, the story engaging, the characters well developed. However, it was too difficult to earn the in game currency. Perhaps you could add in a video where the players are able to earn gems? Even if it's only once it twice a day, I'm sure it'll definitely help. All in all though, this was a great game as usual. Keep up the good work!",
        "I've been obsessed with Sherlock Holmes since I was about 7. Every incarnation of him, be it the books, the TV show or even the anime has left me completely in awe of Sherlock.  So I'm sad to say that I feel this falls short. As it's own game, it's great. I love the story and the characters are well developed. However, I went into it with a certain idea of how Sherlock should act, and it's not what I got. I understand why though, and it's not too distracting from the game. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The puzzles were a fun mechanic (a little easy for my liking, but still enjoyable) and the art style is really pleasing. Overall, I do think it's a game worth downloading.",
        "I really love it. Just like the other \"shall we date\" games you guys made. However, twice already did i not get my free SH points after doing the required action for it. Is there anything for that? Also if you guys are into the idea, you can do a free small amount of gems for watching an advertisement once every day or something? All the rest in the games you guys make is awesome and i love em all.",
        "The best Shall We Date game by far.  The characters are funny,  especially Sherlock and I love the plots.  If you can make Sebastian,  Jack, Hercule,  Jeremy and even Lestrade's routes it would be SUPER appreciated.  Omg, I think Lestrade's route would be the funniest because ALL of them would rip and mock him.  üòÇ  Update: I still think it's the best one.",
        "I just have to say: I love that the MC is not the usual cheerful idiot that somehow makes every guy fawn over her even though she can barely string a sentence together. This MC is portrayed as witty and intellegent as well as beautiful.  All the guys are also intellegent and quirky.  The stories are well written AND well edited. I never have trouble figuring out the plot due to poor grammar or translations.",
        "Great game, I think it's the best game shall we date had. Female lead is independent woman who doesn't make me wonder why everyone likes her. Guys are great as well, plus I absolutely the writing. It's probably the only game were I was bothered to play more than 3 routes"

        "Its a fun game. Still feel forced in the beginning to buy because ofbhow challenging and tough it is. But I think thats what I like about it; challenge.  but its a great game. Probably my favourite TF game. Hope to have new levels come out soon. Maybe another 100 or so? ;)  Update: I recently had to nuy a new phone. I thought meh, and started over again, but then I thought about it and I cant seem to find a way to recover my previous progression. It shows it in achievements but can not actually srart where I finished. Is there a way to do so? Thanks for the help.",
        "Pretty fun. Some levels are very hard and it is no so obvious how to win. VERY different than 1 and 2 where there was a clear logical way to win. Tournament level: I like the idea but some levels are sooooo hard I have no clue how to beat it! Overall fun and challenging!",
        "Freemium Alert!! The game itself is great. Until you get to around level 5 on the upgrades. Instead of coins, you start having to pay with crystals. This is where you have to start paying with real money to get crystals, to then get any further. Disappointing that you can't complete this with paying to win. Now feels like a waste of time.",
        "I got to the point where I couldn't move forward anymore without upgrades. I can do the tournaments to get items for upgrades but the tournaments were the same every week. Then BAM! They changed up the tournament for me and made it more challenging.  I love this game!",
        "I played this before a few years ago, have reinstalled and now it looks different but the same style.  However there are now now skull heads that instantly destroy your towers and you cant seem to avoid that.  The towers get knocked back for energy quicker than before as well.  The skull heads are the killer though as makes it impossible to win.",
        "Is a typical tower defense game... Bit. easier to learn and has it's own unique system for tower leveling... plus watch videos to earn points for the game got stuck and could not beat any of levels up for me top play.. restarted"

        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy.",
        "Not bad. Sometimes freezes a little during game play but usually resolved itself. The wind is usually fair for each player's turn so that's good. Overall a good little time waster game. The only thing I would suggest is to make it a little easier/more often that gold bricks get collected. I've played for over a month now and got about 8 since starting."

Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice! The creators aren't listening to the players and you may want to seriously consider before investing in this game."

        "Would give 5 stars but after you get to a certain level you have to spend real money to get farther. I have spend 65 dollars on this game so far and have been scammed so many times. Its a super fun game but so hard to get anywhere. You should be able to stock up shields. Also its stupid that you have to pay to talk. I might get the VIP if some things changed.",

        "This game is so much fun. Enjoyable, challenging and addicting. However the only problem with the game is the fact that in order to play the levels, you have to collect enough tokens to unlock them. Now this is fine, if there is something else to do in the game. But there isn't. You have to wait real time in order to play anything of the game. And there is no option to watch a video to gain 10 tokens. It straight up only allows you to buy tokens with actual currency. Micro transactions can be used as long as there is a way to play the game without them. But apart from that minor flaw. I cannot recommend the game enough as it's a challenging blast. Just a shame about the tokens.",
        "A fun game overall, but there are way too many ads. You can remove ads with a micro-transaction of buying tokens or coins, but I refuse to do that as I have more coins than I need as it is. As others have noted, it would be nice if your time-replenished tokens count was more than 10, as many puzzles cost more than 10 tokens to play. You can spend coins to replay a level and get more tokens, and there is a \"super-hard\" level in the main puzzle that is actually pretty easy and awards 3 tokens.",
        "Brilliant game and the only one I have found that doesn't auto fill the 'x' as you play. Perfect. However, as you progress the chance to get tokens reduces as the cost of each level goes up which means it takes days to get enough from daily bonus to play one level.  Pay wall doesn't pay out so waste of time. Very disappointing.",
        "The game is truly fun. Can't play very long because the tokens don't regenerate fast enough. I was winning tokens on some levels but since I purchased some tokens I haven't won a single one. Now that the tokens I paid for are gone I'm still not winning tokens (only coins, but it requires tokens to open the levels) so it's back to not being able to play very long",
        "This game was great untill it became unplayable. Every level or square on the puzzle needs to be unlocked with tokens. As you go through the game all levels start costing more and more tokens. At the start around 4 tokens per lv now after 234 puzzles 16 tokens. That is total b.s. so at best I can play a single game a day. So only play if your not planning on finishing or playing them a lot of money.",
        "The cells are too small to click on without accidently pressing the surrounding squares. Also, on the Galaxt S8 with the curved screen, the edge of the playing grid goes too far over the side of the phone, making it impossible to click on any of the cells in the last column."

No explanations on some features, you have to figure it out by trial and error wasting resources. I'm at castle level 15, dragon level makes no difference so far only troop level does. Events are useless because the top spenders take everything before you can even find the location. Misleading descriptions in-game costing you resources.

        "With daily events and online 3v3 matches; not to mention the addicitve meat farm and egg hatching. It's another GREAT game for the digimon fans, both new and old, to enjoy!   On a side note: I do wish they would add abit more to/continue the \"story mode\" but add abit of a cpu challenge to it.",
        "I love this game, I've been on almost everyday. It looks great, there are many Digivolution paths to take, and battling is a ton of fun. My only real complaint is the chat.. my friend and I use a private chat to talk all the time while waiting for stamina to recharge, but it's pretty buggy, censoring a lot of really common, non offensive words like anything with an \"ho\" or \"is\", and for some reason the word \"ready\" is censored too.. if this could be fixed, it would be great.",
        "It's a good game, really easy to play and yoy get the hang off it but one of my biggest complaint is the grind! The whole game is about grinding to get good digimon but the drop rates are so freaking low! The game would be more enjoyable if the rates were higher. I don't want to be spending so much time for me to save up stamina just for me to use it in seconds and get nothing. Hopefully they change it if not then this game is probably going to be forgotten soon",
        "Great works. As a big fan im really looking forward if Bandai can also bring back the classic old school dot digivice game into modern one. Not mmorpg.. But just that classic nostalgic dot nostalgic game. I really like digimon unlimited that a fan made before where we raise one digimon in many ways. Too bad its not bandai work. I definitely play if u make one",
        "The games is really fun and i love how the systems work. There are some issues however, for example WAY WAY WAY too grindy. Thats the biggest because during events you have to commit your life to the game to progress your gamestate. Additionally if you use stones in someone else's hosted co-op game they're gone despite it not being your fault and with the tiny amount of stones you get after 3 10 captures it adds up. Needs reworks but is good over all.",
        "Most people will say that it is kinda hard to get to mega. And I think they got a point but well in my own oppinion, this game comes with its own strength and weakness. I manage to get my rosemon and wargreymon and now I'm working on my taomon. My point is. This game is good overall but it can be better if there are feature that we can do to enhance our interaction with other player. A clan or guild or something like that. Keep ap the good work and I'm looking forward to the next update."

So far I've downloaded and uninstalled seven match three games because of that issue. If it requires spending money I don't have in order to go further into the game, it too will be uninstalled and I will lower the star rating.",
        "This game is highly addictive, fun game to play!  I was on level 302 when I was cleaning out some old games and accidentally deleted Jewels Temple Quest!  To say the least I was very upset,  but I'm back on board, know what to do and am whipping through the levels!  I LOVE THIS GAME!",
        "Lost game progress and adds back after installing on new phone despite paying for removal.   Customer support email doesn't work. Still no reply here on Google Play..how does buyer protect work?",
        "Its a good simple game thats not overly involved.  But there seems to be no reason to keep score nor is there any real reason for the stars you get for each level. You can only buy hammers with gold which you only get TEN pieces per level no matter WHAT you score OR how many stars you get. And theres a lot of ads. Every time you you play a level.",
        "I love playing this game and many others. This game is easy but challenging. I do not like real hard games. I am 69 yrs.old and not as quick as I used to be. This game is good for me. Thanks.",
        "Adorable match 3. Game play seems fine. Advancing levels without glitches so far. Very addictive, so will submit a better review after some time to play. Don't like the review prompt so early in the game. Not sure yet."

        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "You guys might want to consider making occasional, if not regular update for the game, especially on the events. At least keep up with the regular, basic ones. It was enjoyable. Missed the old days even tho so many changed drastically for good or for worst. The difficulty in everything is not really bothersome but if the minor rewards are slightly helpful, they could bring a fortune to you guys and us, players. Conclusion, please give us what we deserves üòä",
        "Great game but when i tried to use gems for instant research it didnt work and spent my gems and i tried to do it about 3 or 4 times and it spent all my gems without doing anything. I tried reopening the app and i tried resetting my phone too, to see if it was just a glitch. Please do something about this. I would like my gems back",
        "Used to be a decent game. The game developers have basically abandoned it and only use it to get cash on the side. No game updates for months. Small problems have been popping up now and then. Not worth the time, the game's just going downhill from here",
        "Too brutal and hardcore for new players. 100 times more powerfull players attack your base when you level up to lvl 6. You loose all you troops and you don't have food to develope new troops and it takes forever to get enough food and train new forces. And you are attacked again and so on. Unistalled game right after that. Alliance is no help.  They have copied whole game from the Zgirls game. Just a little different graphics",
        "Loved the game, except for the bi-weekly slaughter fest, until they stopped updating the game and stopped supporting the players. Spent money to upgrade the bank, but it keeps reverting back to level 0. Been trying to get it unlocked for weeks, but support doesn't respond. Don't waste your time and especially don't put any money into the game!"

        "This game is quite relaxing and can be competitive at the same time. It's a good game for you to chill.  Hi gamegos, could you do something about the accidental purchase? Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",
        "Love this game spent some money on it but still very fun.  They do specials on packages pretty cheap that speed things up.  Has a lot to do in it too doesnt get boring.  Good if you have a long time to play or just a couple minutes.",
        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics.

Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",

Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",

This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",

        "The game is fun to play casually. Just open it up a few times a day and level up the heroes or whatever. Now whenever I open the app, it functions the same except the graphics are glitched out. Some icons are missing completely. It is making me not want to play it as often. Wish I knew what to do to fix it. Tried reinstalling it, and that fixed it for a few hours.",
        "The game itself is fun, but there are two major bugs I ran into that ruined the gameplay:  1. Starting at zone 500, some of the idle ancients stop working entirely. Then when you reset after reaching 500, they continue to not work even at earlier waves. Incredibly disappointing.   2. When I spent 500 rubies to activate the \"double damage permanently,\" it immediately and permanently reduced my damage output 10x. Ruined all my progress and wasted my rubies.  Fix those two things and you've got yourself an excellent game.",
        "I'd give five stars except for a serious bug after about zone 130. The idea is that your heroes fight for you while your away, so you progress a bit while you're not actually playing. That's the nature of clicker games. This works as expected before zone 130, but after 130 it glitches a lot, removing a lot of your current progress.   It seems to only remember cleared zones, but not the progress within zones. For example, if I'm on zone 181 and it's moving at a rate where it looks like it would clear the zone after 20 minutes, it will reset the zone to zero if I open the app before that. Oddly, it still pays out the gold, but the progress is lost.",
        "It's really nice not too laggy at all. You get new characters all the time to help tour team and upgrade them. And it's very fun to get a boss so much gold and if your away for 2 days for example you wold come back and the monsters would keep dieing.",
        "Use to play it years ago, tryed it again now. Transcend and that Ponyboy really ruined the game I think. Progression is oversimplified and lightning fast to a point it doesn't feel fun for me at all. There is one build that is way to obvious and better then anything else.",
