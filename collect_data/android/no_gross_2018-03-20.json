        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "Updates keep getting stuck with the ver 3.8.1. Since it was released. Download 269 out of 269 but nothing happens after that, and a message of \"connection error\" keeps appearing. Have passed the daily log in bonus, and will probably lose the consecutive login bonuses as a result. Didn't create transfer code or link to fb account yet so may risk of losing account if I reinstall. Please fix this asap.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star"

Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "Fun way to pass time and super addictive but most of the levels are insanely hard. Some can only be completed if you're lucky enough to get the bonus items in the right place. Also the safe box is getting on my nerves. I thought it was a limited time offer and would go away but it's been there for 2 weeks now!",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Curious to see if they manage to respond properly this time",
        "I have been playing this for 1.5 years. I love everything about this game. They always have fun events - usually 2-3 events occur at the same time. You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",
        "I love this game! I play at every opportunity I get. Thanks for helping me set up the game on my tablet. I have however, run into another issue I hope you can help me resolve. I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",

        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "Well I like the game. It's fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don't open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.",
        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖"

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though.",
        "I am currently on vacation and this app has given me more points of interest than using Google Maps alone!!  Every single pokestop is something interesting...  I don't know why I didn't think to use it for this sooner.  I've seen more in this city today than I have the 3 days I've been here!"

        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Game is awesome... sometimes it takes days to get past one level which is dumb.... wish I could move ahead in the game faster... would make it more enjoyable.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly."

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

        "Bright, colorful, addictive game play. Adorably happy graphics. Love \"Mr. Encouragement\", who exclaims \"sweet!\", & \"delicious!\" in his baritone voice. The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",
        "good way to teach us to be patient should we prefer to play freely.   Occasionally error.  KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",
        "entertains well. but plz try to improve the swiping feature ncz when we want to play the first or second episode ,have to swipe all over down n got fed up with that, its taking too much time to do so. its really urgent to improve that thing.",
        "Very disappointed in this app over the last several months.  Every time I go into app to play game I get kicked out.  It is not always immediate which is very frustrating because I will loose lives etc UN-necessarily."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I absolutely adore this app for it's witty, adorable characters and simple yet infinite concepts. I'm addicted! I have one issue, though. The limits on the barn and silo, frankly suck. I have eleven duct tapes but no screws so I had to pay diamonds I didn't want to spend so I could have a little flexiblility! Please fix this.",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan"

I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Have played this game virtually since it first started it's a great game but why do we haveto buy the gold bars we have earned throughout the games I have never spent a cent buying anything! Shouldn't most of the gold bars be awarded to us for being loyal gamers ☺",
        "At level 558 I quit this game like 2=3 years ago... Now I don't even remember how to defeat spiders etc... Thought it would be fun to start over from scratch... But of course in these games not even a chance...  Great fun... NO",
        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it.",
        "I love this game as it's challenging but not ridiculously hard! Very addictive & u can get coins & power ups within the game, 2 help u, so there's no need 2 buy any! 🤗 Pity more games aren't like that!! 😊"

They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",
        "Ok new review, I've passed all 1740 levels would have given 5 stars but the upper levels can only be passed when you hit the right program! Play same level 20-30+ times then suddenly pass with 10-15 moves left!!! Not fun anymore!!! Uninstalled",
        "This game was my favorite, however the lack of being able to reset the game is truly sad 😢 and takes away from my joy of the game! Please give the option for us to reset our play easily, please 💕",
        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot.

        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together.

I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",

But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",

Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed.

        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "Scam company that's only interested in taking your money. Events are rigged and if you ask them for probabilities or odds on winning a particular hero they fob you off with \"it's all random, and you need good luck\".....avoid spending any money on this app",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Absolutely love this game! Been playing forever, this game never gets boring. It's completely free, you just have to be patient and cautious with your materials. Amazing for a free to play app 😍😍",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜",
        "This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven't experienced anything toxic, yet. I've been playing for about a week and it's really great"

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "Love this game addictive and lose time playing it. But anyone else having problems logging in? When i try to log in it just sits on the loading screen (on 100%).. Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio.",
        "Great Game! Really captures that what made SIMS fun and for mobile on the go at that! Graphics are reasonable considering it is new. When building houses the only drawback is you cant construct walls within a room, you have to work with box rooms. As well as you cant make like a out door patio without it being in a room enclosure.  All in all though I do highly recommend this game to you if youve enjoyed SIMS games in the past. Loads to do,events and updates to keep you busy for awhile."

        "This season I really put in a big effort to try and win the treble. Got the best players, do all the training, strategy ect. All for nothing. Lost against a crappy team in semi of Cup. Apparently according to IA it wasn't my day. Like I said before, game is pre programmed. Dev's do nothing about the gameplay, they rather concentrate on silly add ons which can make them money. Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is 👌 I love it",
        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAİN that SYSTEM DİVİSİON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER DİVİSİON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs",
        "I think u guys should find a way for us(we the managers) to get tokens easier . I don't understand why winning the league or champions league only gets you money but no tokens . it really sucks"

AND THEN WHEN THE NEW UPDATE COMES OUT.... I LOSE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you PLEASE give me the stuff back.",
        "This is my favorite game.I have played it since I was in P1 but the only things that I want Rilisoft to make are a 4th campaign world cause I have been waiting for almost 4 years and that you can give your friends weapons.But still great and memorable game so well done Rilisoft",
        "I like this game a lot. I don't know if I were think too much but I feel like Everytime I level up, the weapon that I use before was unexpectedly weaker.Lucky chest seem to drop only coins and crysrals(sometimes I got free spin). And some modes, weapons and armor balance is not really that balance (example:last match I used smart bullet bazooka to kill people using 4 rockets to kill them. But he killed me with only 2 rockets of smart bullet bazooka...... How is that even balance?!). I hope you fix this soon. Because I love to play game.",

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

        "My first played MOBA. This is excellent game and there's nothing could beat this game. Otherwise, please make improvement like losing stars cause of that AFK player. Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

No help, and no fun if you enjoy the leveling up your character part. Basically if you want to watch your character bounce around and  not know what's going on then this games for you. To be fair, guess you would pick it up sooner or later ; (",
        "Great game love it, but now we're getting a merge, FWI 4399game don't make all the players go back to level one Plz! No one wants to start over because of merging players! It's not appropriate, and why, again Why do we have to start over! PLZ CHANGE YOUR MIND PLZ! 😢",

        "This auto complete thing can be good, but I don't like how it does everything for you. You don't even play the game, it plays itself and has zero explanation of what to do, just pulls you into different directions. Sorry, if I want to play a game, I ACTUALLY WANT TO PLAY IT!!!",

        "Was an awesome game. Now log in is in Korean and can't log in when I only ever used my Google account but now it only ask for my name and password in Korean. Stupid developers and their broken updates. They ruined a great game."

        "This is a great game for any Bleach fan   Don't listen to the people who say developers don't care and only want money... this game was originally Japanese and they are transferring it over to English and this takes time.. this game is great the characters look great the game play is very good and even... lvl system is easy n fun and you get what u put into the game. Yes some characters are harder to get then others but that's what makes the game fun and worth playing.. yes the game has a VIP system for those that want to spend money to get better things or characters but that doesn't mean you have to do it to enjoy the game...",
        "I used to love this game but after two app reset wipes, I'm over it sorry going to brave souls who's with me?! Update: after reaching out to the admins on I was able to recover my data from my Google account. The data can not be transferred from ios to Android but that's fine. Thank you admins, sorry for the salt.",
        "Even though the descriptions and dialogues in the game are bit off it doesn't completely take away from the experience of the game. It still does have some bugs, like the dialogues for instance, but the game is really addictive. It's one of very few games that I've been playing religiously for the past few months, probably longer. That's the one of the main reasons why I'm giving 5 *'s. The game has an ENORMOUS amount of potential, I think if the devs got licensing rights then it would improve the game so much more. One thing I really do not like about the game is that it is kind of a pay-to-win game. You have to spend real money to advance quicker or become stronger in the game faster. Other than the cons, it really is a fun and addictive game. If you love anime, if you love fan service, if you love action games, if you just love Bleach in general then you will definitely love this game.",
        "Not very good it fell short of the other apps...it still missing half the content of the others while making it impossible without paying to collect keys.. shard collecting is lacking ...unless you want to pay for anything halfway decernt gameplay you won't find it here",
        "Been playing for the past month. I've had zero issues that I can think of that I've read others having. It's a fun and addicting game. I can't wait for all of the other characters to be added in, only thing I dislike is wanting to play them but they aren't in it. Though I understand why. Great game would certainly recommend.",
        "Only installing because i spent hundreds in the last one. Devs only care about your money, don't fix or take forever to fix issues, and the game is basically pay to win. Yiu can still get decently for free, but don't expect to get to the top that way. Take the 1 star reviews seriously... A lot of ppl stopped playing because of this games BS..."

This game is perfect! The only thing I would like is could you possibly offer other ways to get more lives? Like watch a video to fill up ( like angry birds pop) or spin the wheel? I just hate waiting soooo long when I run out of lives, because I want to keep playing!!!!",
        "I've enjoyed this game, but I haven't been able to open it for several days. I hate to uninstall and lose all my progress. Any help would be appreciated. Ok, so after about a month of not loading it started working...for a month now it's down again. I upgraded today, 2/19, and still won't open, grrrr! Help!! Changed my 5 stars to 1! The game constantly freezes, closes and then won't reload. I've reinstalled 4 times and that's it I'm done. Really disappointing as when it runs it's so much fun.",
        "For some reason right in the middle of playing it has been quitting and then I lose that life. Very frustrating. Is there and update available?",
        "I love this game but for like 3 months since i updated I can't play and I just updated again and still the same doesn't let the game download it frozes, can you please fix that, or let me know what i can do, I dont want to uninstall it so I don't loose my progress.  Starting to get aggravated.  Thank you.",
        "I like this game a lot and would give higher reviews but a lot of times if I am playing a level and have one move left it ends the level and I never get to make the move. It's some kind of glitch in the game. I think it's trying to get me to buy gems and coins. Very frustrating and annoying.",

You give them what they need and no one fallows up on it. All you get back is the same automated response. Then they remove your ticket. So if you have problems with the game don't bother contacting them it's a waist of your time. THERE'S NO ONE THERE FOR YOU. Can't get my account back. That's all I want. It's simple NO???????",
        "Another month, another violent smash and cash grab. Putting an entire LT behind a character requirement that 99.9% of the player base has next to no chance of getting with obfuscated \"odds\" that require one to spend 1000s of dollars for a \"chance\"(not even guaranteed) to get a character. At this point, I'm only updating the game to keep my reviews more relevant and higher weight.",
        "It's a good game. Awesome graphics, great gameplay,amazing superstar etc. But not good for free player because you don't get good superstar and rate of getting better superstar is very very low. Even some time in 4 pulls. I didn't get any 2 star silver card. Please make rare superstar drop rate more or I can't go any further in this game and make this game more free player friendly.",
        "Basically I have been playing this game over the past year... It is a totally addictive and 100% entertaining game... Only downside which has forced me to stop playing is that I have just acquired a new phone and attempted to load the game with my login details (for both Facebook & Google) but have found that I now have to start from the beginning again... I've now become mildly disappointed unless this can be fixed I don't think I will be playing again as I put too much time into this for me to start from the beginning again!!!",
        "It is my favrt game ever when i play this i stuck with this game I want to say something  now it's giving  too many ads and a problem  when I log out it says only one thing again and again that this account using on another device  but it's not real and what I do I am help less and I can't get new powerful superstars 😭😭😭😭😭when I open with cash he always give me duplicates.. Give some new cool events like wrestlemaina T-shirts..",
        "Love playing this game until google services crashed my phone and when I came back on to the game after having to reset everything, I lost access to my account. I have contacted customer services and all they do is send a pregenerated message that answers and resolves nothing!!  5 days and still receiving the same message back.. Even my faction leader has provided information to determine that my account is indeed my account and that I am active in his faction. But still SCOPELY send the same annoying generated message.

Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted."

One last thing, the co-op mode has some bug where u created the room but unable to start the game even when u have enough player. Please fix that, thank you.",

        "The game is really addictive. Hours of game play and activities. I really like it. However, since it's international the time for coop game should be more flexible so i can join with my friends at suitable time. Tournament matching is a little bit unbalanced, either it's a raid or it's a total defeat. And heroes skills should  give more details on stats, so we can plan effectively. Thank you for such a good game.",
        "They are about to make it more of a money trap with an update that screws f2p and budgeted p2w. They say they have free events and events so part time p2w have fun. Then why are people talking about quitting? These are high paying players. I know you plan on making it so hero's bought for special skills like stun and silence won't work if there's a big gap. You've made it so hero's bought for the purpose of moving these budgeted p2w are useless. So it's in favor of real p2w. It should be a reverse. Make the lower people have a better chance not a worse one.",

Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on..",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "The last update sucks! Premove is not at all intuitive. It now just shows the block which we want to move the pawn and doesn't move the pawn itself like before. The toast message that showed 'challenge rejected' was better than the current one. Dislike it!!",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team."

Be warned, it's not the game it was and until it steps up on customer service, I wouldn't put any money into it.",
        "Tried reinstalling on a new device and it couldn't connect to facebook. Couldn't recognize my email (even though I get emails from them). Kept trying to get me to make a new account. I'm sorry, but when I play something off and on for roughly half a decade, then I'd like for the app to work so I can retrieve my account. Fix it, and I'll change my review because I really do love this game.",
        "I'll give this game a higher rating only if the game support will release my epic monster, which is permanently locked for mission at the dig site. A glitch that they fail to do anything. No response, no support.",
        "I'm revising my review.. I use to love this game. Now it's becoming more like a pain in my behind to even play. The game is not allowing me to do normal things that I'm suppose to be able to do. It's really making me angry!",
        "I really love the hell out of this game.. Those haters who say its slow its not.. your phone is. your CPU is tacy as F plz don't blame the game..",
        "Takes 2 mins to load then you have to press \"try again\" 20 times then wait for 2 mins and repeat everything 100x before it can load then just after you beat a boss you have to press try again 100x then it crashes. Best game ever."

        "This game is amazing a full on batlle with strategic ways to beat your opponent. The only thing im concern with is not seeing much to do in an alliance than donating troops. I would like to see a way were you can team battle and get awards but other than that its a five star game",
        "This game is amazing! But enemy units keep getting stuck behind walls Also there are a few enemy lands that are not responding when you tap on them. This didnt happen before.  I think updating attack list would be good. So you could see who you have attacked, not just who attck you. Just  a thought",
        "It's a great game but I think it be better if you created workers and mined,  lumbered, and gather favors or technology like warcraft use to be like.  The commands are also touchy and the battle displays for viewing if kinda difficult to  keep up with. But it's fun and a little bit addictive.",
        "Amazing graphic but really poor gameplay... Even lowest level, it's hard to complete easy campaign. Every win need to paid. Useless to raid... Uninteresting how the mission needed to complete... Disliked this game bcoz of the poor gameplay and the way of how to complete the mission.",
        "Awesome graphics. Awesome concept. You actually choose your tactic. Not just....\"I'm going to send a march at a castle and hope for the best\" like so many other games do now. In my opinion, its a very nice single player game. Only things that would make it more intriguing would be the addition of defensive towers or being able to attack at same time with an ally. Other than that, great game. And you don't NEED to spend money!",
        "Ive been playing this game a very long time now. definitly a 5 star game in every aspect. only issue is.. i spend money on this last event.. 3 raids left to get 14k reward for the 4 star poison ranger.. the bloody game hang again..manage to log back only when the event was over..!!! Now i have this 2 useless relics taunting me.. Almost felt like deleting the game.."

        "I stop playing C C because I loved this game... I noticed that we use way more than we get!! And to only get a few tickets for every 10 Bingo's then having to wit for 22hrs....only 4 tickets and hr...and it takes way to long to get to the next level and when do reach it we get very little tickets!!! Dont have to many deals to get both tickets and special prizes... Also how does it when a game starts right after a tournament that I end up in the thousand plus  rank below the bronze??? As much as I love this game think its time to give it a rest until there re more incentives to bring me back!!!",
        "My game keep freezing up and not submitting my scores not giving me boosters I acquired during that round. Please fix the issues and give me back my points and boosters. Thank you   I just played again and I played the whole game but when it's time to tally the score the game freezes. I lost 3 footballs and a treasure chest plus my points. Please respond to my issues. I haven't heard from anyone yet. But I still like the game. Just want it to stop robbing me....",
        "This is definitely a fun bingo app. Where it's lacking or otherwise could be improved, comparatively to ther Bingo games, is the daily spin wheel & daily sign in bonus. Daily 24hr sign in should provide a much larger number of free tickets & include daily free power ups. Earning one or two power ups w a single spin of the wheel is anticlimactic! Power ups are a vital way to  daily tournament advancement, bingo wins & simy make playing more fun. Completing a pizzule is impossible without power-ups or making a purchase. However, a big win for this app. is the ability to sign in each new day to a new tournament which helps level the playing field. Special tournaments and/or the add' side bonuses, like the \"turkey daub\" made playing & making a purchase worth wild!",
        "Good, keeps me coming back for more. The only thing I don't like is there is no way of getting that many puzzle pieces in the time. Could you maybe let us play till we get the Puzzle Complete to get the rewards.",
        "I am addicted to this game. I think you should get more power ups instead of ticket's. Cause you run out of power up's. I feel you should get bingo power up's instead of ticket's. On the bonus spin they should add bingo power up's of 4. I need more bingo power up's. And would like to get power up's for daubing every number called each game. I need more power Up's. And the game should give you tickets when you get every number that is called correctly on each card every game that you play.",
        "The new additions of the outlaws was great, but then you added all these \"special\" days that serve no purpose but to make people spend money. I have spent plenty already but not for every game. Sorry guys, bad move. Too greedy."

So far, and I am a budding designer myself and I will keep this one as long as they support it and update it... Aces, review by Da1 G Reaper of the Sun Tzu Ghosts Gaming Community... #livfreeplyhard #STGGC",
        "Good luck in this game if ya don't want to spend money. No game balancing meaning a lvl12 can attk lvl  1 with no post attk shield or protection of any kind. Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",
        "Hi A.K server 52. Have been playing for couple of months now and still love the game.just when you think you are on top of things something new comes up. I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

        "It's a great Game. My only issue is there are bullies in the game and you have to always be on to Protect your Fortress and Buoys or they will be destroyed and then you loose everything. Seems everywhere you go there are bullies. And they take forever to do a server merge when you're server is dieing. But overall still a good Game. Also there needs to be a server merge for a few servers. Some of the servers are dieing and some players are quitting because there's nothing new and the targets are slim to none. And alot are written to Joy City and asked for a merger and get nothing. Something needs to be done",
        "Great work in new update joycity. You guys always remove one bug and add tons of other bugs in every update. After March update I can see what I'm typing in chat box until I send it.",
        "Fun game if you keep buying packs.   Too many daily updates that keep you waiting to play until update is done.  Very lousy customer service.",
        "Latest update today 21/3 terrible played for 30 secs froze had to turn off happened few times in a row now please fix",
        "Is a scam as I brought a pack for the quest and it wouldn't count towards it but has no info telling people about the problem but Has potential to be a great game but when I wrote to joy city stating the server I play on is pretty much dead and hard to find active people they told me to create a new profile on a new server after putting hours and spending alot on this game they need to sort out there customer care team after being told that it's wrong especially player like me and others who spend money on game and also sort out all these dead servers to make the game exciting again"

        "It's pay to win for sure. However, if you play daily and stick to monthly and quarterly cards you'll rack up gems and heroes quickly. It took me over a year to get my VIP high enough to get the monthly meta heroes. I get an hour or two a day out of it and even when I didn't have the monthly paid heroes I had a fun time. I don't mind spending $15/month for the amount of time the game helps me kill.",
        "I'm a paying customer, which they call \"VIP\" but you best believe you are far from important. I had an issue with a purchase in December, but support takes a week per message to reply and isn't useful at all about the issue and tells you they can't help. Should have let Google refund the money before the 48 hours instead of giving their support a chance.",
        "Don't download the game . If u want to win u must spend thousands dollars. A huge skins with control every month 2 new heroes with amazing power. Every month making new heroes and the old ones getting trash. Random game no strategy. Just click for pic. Ucool don't do anything. Don't download!!! I played more than one year and every month it's getting worst. The forgetting about players. They think only for cash. Ucool one of the worst organisation..if u don't spend a money please don't start the game .nice pictures  and that it )))",
        "This game was a very well balanced game between free play gamers and those that put money into it. Not anymore. If you want to be competitive you must put handreds of dollars each month (no joke). Very dissapointed in the way this game has become.",
        "A very good game but a pay to win. I myself paid 73$ and I am VIP 8. This game can be fun without paying but to get the most out of it atleast  buy an annual card for 30$. If you have even more to throw away try buying all the cards when they run out get a new one. (Mainly Annual and Season Card. Week card isn't a must have). Also if you are new to the game wait for a new server to start. That way you wont fall behind. I am on server 210 and have also played on server 207. I was in this game when it was brand new and purple heroes were the best. I was in 1 of the 1st servers and f2P I quit the game at lvl 50 though. All in All if you want to play this game prepare 100$",
        "The menu is very unresponsive when scrolling. Also, when killing enemies, particularly after using a special ability, the enemy simply freezes and then fades away - there's no animation for the death of the enemy and this is disappointing and detracts from the immersion. Otherwise it's a good game, but significantly more heroes would be necessary to keep me interested."

        "Good time waster. I bought it just to get rid of the ads. I have a shop now and the game is more fun. Update : they updated the game, but STILL didn't add any new levels! Come on, Devs. Update- new levels finally, but don't know what they are- not enough money to see them!",
        "It's okay, should have more items in the storage bays, it's supposed to be just like a regular storage unit and it's not even close to that. And I believe the other buyers could say different things instead of the same phrases over and over. Maybe y'all can make it a little more realistic.",
        "Fun until you get to Miami.. absolutely impossible to make 100 000.00 to unlock the next level.  Computer outbids or up bids you so that you either give up or lose your money.  No daily incentives to keep brining you back.  Unless you are willing to spend real money for boosters and money to move on.. play to Miami and then delete.. impossible to move forward after that.",
        "The game was addictive and fun until you get to Miami. 100k to unlock that level is absurd and unrealistic. Its to hard to make that kind of money playing and now its just playing the same level over and over trying to get enough. Now its boring!! I'm disappointed, I really enjoyed playing until that point.",
        "Was a great game until I got to Miami level 19 now just bloody stupid & waste of time. I went to 4 straight auctions couldn't buy a unit because competitors bid more than what the units worth how are you suppose to level up & move on when the designers of the game make stupid unrealistic flaws in the game no bidder is going to bid in real life on items they can't see or know are there so why put this into the game? Fix this issue & I will adjust my review accordingly!",
        "Good game. I like the game however  this is the 4th time it has asked me to do a review. I have done this all 4 times with no reward and it still keeps asking me to do  it. Very frustrating"

Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",

But, there's not enough energy or chances to win energy or earn it. 10 isnt enough!There's times when I'm out of energy and have done everything I can do and have to leave the game but still feel like playing. I've spent money on this game but I don't always have money to buy energy or coins to buy energy. There should be more give-a-ways, prizes, little games, etc to earn more energy so I can keep playing!! Also, I'd like to be able to friend request other players and send them things. Like people on my team on here.  Thank you! Lynn Mauger",
        "Amazing! It is an amazing game that you go and figure out the death of somebody. You go through stages and different areas and you must find hidden objects. You get coins and bucks that you spend on things to make your world. Great time taker.",
        "There are quite a few objects that are incorrectly identified. For example, there is a screen used for changing clothes behind, but it is what you need to find when asked for a \"lamp.\"  The pace is not good. In gameplay, you collect coins used for buying decorations. You have to place decorations to advance the gameplay. But if you have no coins and are at an impasse in the gameplay because you need decorations, you're stuck unless you lay down real cash.  A lot of the problems the developer is aware of, because their next game like this, June's Journey, is much better.",

        "Pretty cool Bingo. It would be nice if more scratchers were available to collect puzzle pieces so you can collect more prizes. Even though you can still win cherries after you completed the scratcher, it seems kind of pointless. My suggestion would be either add more scratchers or remove it once all of the cherry prizes have been collected.",
        "By far, the best bingo app on the market.  There aren't any false numbers or bingo daubs . It also gives you a chance to  earn the cherries instead of paying for them.   They've mixed in ads to the game so it doesn't feel like you're watching commercials between every game.",
        "Out of cherries in less than an hour. Wins are not enough to keep playing. Odd that they would even have a high roller room. Guess you gotta purchase the cherries. FAIL",
        "Wouldn't even let me play. Kept saying I was too young to play even though it didn't give me an option to enter my age",
        "It would be great if there was a way to collect coins and cherries on the Facebook app page. Kind of frustrating",

        "Absolutely sublime! This game is so awesome it's exactly what I want in a dragon game! Although there are microtransactions, you can absolutely play this game without spending a cent to progress! I have never ever payed real money to purchase gold, food and all other resources and I've played this game for almost two years The two tips are a little bit of patience and to keep on breeding. Even if you've already bred a certain pair of dragons, selling unwanted eggs is the best and quickest way to make gold",
        "Once you get to level 100, breeding a dragon is almost impossible to nil. Very frustrating. My roommate and I started this game the same time. I am level 115 and she is on 83. We will breed the same dragons at the same time, she will succeed 85% of the time on the first try, it will take me over 10 times if I even get it, this started after level 100. Good luck long term players.",
        "The events are annoying. I have reached the max on collecting eggs. I just gather then from doing tasks. Does that mean I can't participate anymore and am just stuck. I don't understand. Why would you limit the gathering of items?",
        "Have been playing this game for a couple of years now and I love it! Sometimes it's frustrating - especially when you'd need to buy something to be able to get all the prizes during events - but it just makes it more challenging.  VERY happy with the customer support. I had an issue with a gift not being added to my totals, so I emailed them and they fixed it without issue.",
        "The game is definitely addicting. But when I went into the Egg-straordinary Egg hunt island and tapped on a activty, it said their was a wonky spell and it completely stopped the whole game. I've tried different things different times, and it still won't work. I have played this in the past and the same exact thing happened, but with something different.",
        "This game is AWSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOme. I had 1023 gems saved up and then it glitched and now I only have 34. I love this game so much! Please help me get my 984 gems back! I don't want to rate it lower than 5 stars, but this has happened twice now...😟"

        "At first I thought it was great, but now I realise it's just another PAY-TO-WIN game... You've got no chance if you come up against a paid-for character like Batman. It's such a shame this is the way game devs are heading these days.",
        "*Update Very greedy company-&gt; bad rating from me! They sell packages for 200-300 dollars! What's worse is that there are people who are stupid enough to pay for it. Aside from that a very cool game. To be at the very top it is pay to win. Besides that really cool. Lots of heroes and therefore possibilities.",
        "It's a great game don't get me wrong but as I wrote in previous reviews they just went completely pay-to-win. Nowadays you cannot win not only because you don't have the latest gacha heroes, you just can't win because they released Batman for $160 to be competitive, most broken character ever. They are also releasing legendary pets... For $400 each. So yes, forget about having a fun competition, some players are simply out of you range by how much money they have spent and that ruins the experience.",
        "My first review disappeared so I will leave another.  This game was great at first, then it started inserting the buyable characters such as Batman, Assassin's Creed and they are so over powered, one of them can take down your whole team without taking any damage.  Game is now so unbalanced that it isn't worth playing.  Until they fix the game, it worth playing.  Unless you like wasting money to feel like a god with over powered characters.  Game is dead, play something else.",
        "definitely one of the best game if not the best game ived ever played on mobile. when you pull a hero for free the feeling is incomparable. the strategy you need to bring down other tougher players/guilds, its all here i tell ya! and to cap it all off the customer service is GREAT. you have concerns they reply ASAP what more could one ask for?!  install now! =)",
        "Had the potential to be good but they care more about money than a good game, once you progress so far you will constantly lose to ppl who have bought characters that are vastly over powered. They will auto reply and say plenty of ppl still have fun without out paying, I made it to level 65 and it's just not true."

They do not follow their own rules.  They do not compensate players for their mistakes.  They let Chinese player buy packs cheaper and use at accounts.  If you are a Westerner do not play or pay on this game.  Their customer service sucks.  They actually try to get you to feel sorry for them.  Its amazing.  They will only steal from you.",

The developers claim it's not, but if it wasn't true, then why are 99% of the servers dominated by Chinese players?  Plus the Chinese to English translations are terrible.  You will barely understands what they're saying.",

Like things that have been improved on in this genre of game in other apps are still frustrating here. Oh well, what can I expect from a freemium game? Overall it's enjoyable but I have to take it in doses; basically until I get frustrated by the gameplay or other players. All in all, there are worse was to spend your time."

Play in tournaments, and get rewards to assist in your upgrading. What's not to love,  course I'd like to see this game run without an internet connection so I could play offline too...thanks.",
        "Not a great game. Played for half the day. Game will no longer start and tells me to make sure I'm connected to the net. Oh I'm really that dumb. World chat is more like a dating site and is not child friendly. The admins do nothing to stop the behaviour in world chat. I strongly advise you not to allow your kids anywhere near this game",
        "If your hobby is watching paint dry this is the game for you. This game is entirely too time consuming for anyone with a real life. Which I guess is why no one is here for the game . Everyone playing is here to get credits in another game .  Which is why this game has so many downloads  not because it's actually good. The over-sexualized comments in the chat rooms are ridiculous. Parents if you are reading this I would not allow my child to play this game unless you are going to sit with them every moment. If you have to do that is it even really worth allowing your child to play the game.",
        "Basically clash of clans looking ads, plays like just any other mmo. Another Mr steal your money if you wanna get good game. If you want something thats fun and never ever going to try to take your money, play clash. 5 years of playing it and ive only bought a 5$ thing bc gems just come so easily and im a lvl170 th10 . No need to spend money to get good",
        "Ummmmm basicly Clash of Clans COPY CAT!!! The adds almost match precisely. If anything download Clash of Clans. I mean this is just insulting to clash of clans and how hard they worked to make clash of clans... lazy! I just downloaded the game to rate it... enjoy my one star review lazy jerks... rate this a one star and download clash of clans.",
        "The game is supposed to be for battling your enemy but you spend countless hours sorting through the packs which are random at best in content offering very little for the price paid. They encourage you to register the game with an email account but give you the run around should you seek to change it. The game is not worth the time nor money."

        "Nice game but the random number generator is non existent. Hold three numbers and roll again, even with free or earned additional rolls, are ALWAYS the same number that was there! This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",

        "Oh wow.. You have got to be kidding me..play limits and an energy system? On the small amount of free content available?? On a chess exercise game with a recurring subscription fee to fully unlock?? Every single thing about this game is designed to be such a ridiculous money grab I actually laughed. It does have a very nice interface but there are a lot of completely free or one time purchase alternatives that are every bit as good.. Definitely don't waste your time and money on this..",
        "OK guys as far as the overall experience with the app was good I could use it all the time to progress my skill at playing chess just like anybody i.e.  any practice  1 possible flaw or idea that I've found which may shift Play Magnus app's popularity is to make a free version of the Magnus Trainer app with only the free content intending this app to be a demo and add more daily activities and challenges to keep them on your app longer  which of course will always end prompting the user to download Premium Magnus which requires an initial $5.00  purchase to begin downloading Magnus Trainer Premium enabling user full access to all the content app offers them. Followed by subscription payments made monthly at the set price of $5.   Might be dumb idea but food for thought I know Runescape had their free server separated from Members only servers also at $5 / mo.  People may  be able  to understand more clearly that if they want the full  app to get way better skills on the board if they want lessons of this caliber then it requires subscriptions to support your hard working team.   The haters will always hate... Keep it up good app",

Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I've really enjoyed reading All the Wrong reasons.  The author is very talented, a true story teller.  As I was reading I felt like part of the story I was so enveloped in the lives of the characters they were alive and real. I was sad when the story ended wanted to keep reading.  I was overjoyed when K. I. S. S.  came out by that very sane author who transported me to a whole new world yet again. I look forward to reading more from this amazingly talented storyteller!!",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked."

If you want to play at the highest level you HAVE TO PAY! There is a very clear pay wall and everyone knows it. If your starting off and your free to play it will take you awhile and I don't even think it will be work it unless you plan to put at least 6 month in to be somewhat relevant.",

        "Pros: • Semi-Balanced pvp. • Tons of characters. • Fun leveling system. • Entertaining in-game events  • Challenging story mode. • No need to pay to become very strong.  • Auto-battles that save time.   Cons: • Constant Pop-ups reminding you to purchase loot boxes. • You will get wrecked by serious pay-to-wins. • Impossible drop rates for 5☆ characters and Chaos/Order heros. • Paying to unlock 5☆ heros that may or may not be 5☆. • The company spamming copy pasted messages to players who have beef with thier game instead of constructive replies.  Overall: Still a pretty cool game.",
        "A game with buckets of potential, led astray by poor decisions & short term constant cash grabs(multiple times a week)  Poor balancing - stat accensions, Crown dust upgrade costs ( when even  avip 10+ lvl60 developer acc hadn't upgraded any crowns..I've checked dozens of high vip lvl 60s 0 upgraded crowns) 6* artis are pointless & don't feel worth owning.  Constant pop ups, easily 40-50 store pop ups per day sometimes multiple times within a minute.  the Lucky 7 quest was criminal, horrendous design & I won't be spending a penny with you guys again until I see you go down a better path.   the positives, autoing but being able to leave the game. Festival/ hero events are pretty damn good although it be nice to see different style events that 'have gameplay'  Characters are well designed & are extremely fun to use.   To summarise, has some excellent features but it's let down by some horrendous balancing & constant cash grabs that would get EA taking notes.",

The game creators could give 2 sh/ts about what is going on .",
        "My phone is not rooted or jail broken, I do not have any hacks installed. I get a message saying illegal program detected by XIGNCODE3. Even after multiple uninstalls/installs, reboots, cache clears. All that time and energy wasted!!!",
        "This is the game I have been searching for. But can't give 5 star because of 2 main reasons. Consume too many data while playing that required fast network and too many bugs... Problems free=5 stars.. What happen? I cannot even play the game now.. I once install and play and later uninstall because of game problem. Now I install and try to play again. I cannot play.. What is the problem? I also want to recover my account too..",
        "Gameplay and graphics is great BUT as you progress you spend more time upgrading units and buildings. Some upgrades take up to a week of upgrading rendering those villagers useless aswell as the rate at which resources comes in as you collect doesnt compensate enough for the costs of upgrades. Its unnecessarily STRETCHED OUT. because of this its a 3 star rating...DONT DOWNLOAD IF YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE. Been playing a year and i dont feel my progress is a representation of the time i have put in. Been playing almost daily!",
        "If you are going to do updates on this game, at least MAKE SURE it isn't lagging! My game since the update has been freezing up and lagging to the point that I select something (a wall for example) and the whole  game freezes and takes a million years just to LOAD. If this game isn't fixed, I'm demanding all my money spent on the game refunded and uninstallment. Not happy.",
        "This is the exact definition of a strategy game, the controls are great and its free. You get to choose your own nation which just adds to the strategy, plus whatever you do in a battle can affect the entire battle. I would recommend it to people who want something with strategy and a bit of hardcoreness. The learning curve is quite steep sometimes."

        "Addictive and engrossing game.  The bonus covers work well. The constant character tweaking and release rate makes the vs progression awards with wins is very good.  The favorites is a good way to let folks focus on building certain characters.  The transition points are still frustrating, especially when you get a run of bad luck with tokens.  Tokens might work better if they scaled instead. Biggest issue is progression awards in versus and the tough transitions in levels.",
        "I have been playing this game for a few years now and love it! But a little suggestion... Because of the time I've spent playing it and the already difficult ability to get 4 and 5 star characters, I have nearly 3 million iso-8 that I literally cannot spend. Please add a way to convert iso-8 into hero points or command points!!! I'd like to get further in the game instead of literally stockpiling iso-8. This has all been done without spending a single dollar on the game too, btw",
        "This is an awesome, addictive and hyper fun game. Brilliant idea and concept. In all the games I have played this is the first I have spent money on. VIP member. Have a couple suggestions for developer tho. Can you add abilities to swap covers with alliance members and maybe add as a bonus drop for playing, an extra free slot. Keep up the brilliant work. Truely love this game.",
        "This is my go-to game. Day and night. It's fun, simple and sometime challenging. My only complaint is that i have like a million of Iso-8 and don't know what to do with them. My thought would be that if we don't need so much Iso-8, be sweet to give some to aliance member who needs it or so on. Great game. Don't know what I'd do without it!",
        "Suitable for all age groups, Marvel Puzzle Quest is a great game for everyone. Progress with higher tier characters may be slow but yet significant. The wide variety of heroes and villians within the game allows for endless possibilities of the \"best team\". Highly addictive, I would recommend this perfect game to anyone and everyone.",
        "Love that they are always adding new characters. Would like to see some different characters like Cable, Domino, Sabretooth, and Bishop just to name a few. Just because they don't have a movie... Would also like to see some new events, new animations, and less repetitiveness. Love the collection part and finally being able to use characters when you've finally built their powers enough. Love that it can be played for free. Love that feedback is read and the game is constantly evolving.Thanks."

        "To the guy that says stop bitching cuz it's free. Reviews are so they can get feedback to improve the game. What good is the game if you can only play 2 games a day? There are too many other games out there that are free that customers can get chips to play for hours. This game should take care of their loyal customers before they move on to some of the other games. So many have posted about the small amount of chips received and they added the spinning wheel, maybe by reading the reviews they are listening and trying to improve chances of getting more chips. If everyone continues to give low reviews, maybe just maybe they'll increase our chances to get more daily chips!",
        "Purchased 90 rockets pack. Explained to me how I used all 90 in one game? Smh, that's too much.. So y'all want ppl to purchase rockets each hand. Y'all can do better. Chip packages as well. Maybe u will get more to contribute to the game. Smh, better chip packages probably will definitely help this game. Especially the price of chips to play verses what the rooms payout... Really is at a disadvantage to players to even purchase.",
        "I usually love this game. However, today I decided to treat myself and purchase some chips to get the last two battle ships that I needed to get 800 chips. The game is so frigging rigged it's just sad. It took all 600 chips that I bought and all that I won trying to accomplish a goal.  I will NEVER purchase chips again, especially in this game.",
        "Most of my purchases lately have been strange disappearing chips and rockets i have spent SO much  money on this game!!! and another thing i could not access any games for 2 days now but it TOOK ALL MY CHIPS AGAIN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU IN REGARDS TO THIS.",
        "Good variety of games. Not many free chips once the first few rounds are played when compared to what the rounds cost. Be ready to buy, buy, buy if you aren't patient. They have added many more chances for free chips. Thank you guys.",
        "I love the game again.  I'd been struggling with glitches and now they're fixed  I'm especially loving the free chips you give sometimes daily!  I've become re-addicted to it!  The new format IS easier to see, but it gets slightly boring when the two cards you CAN daub don't get any numbers!  It looks as if you're phasing out the gems, which is fine with me; I'd rather have all free daubs, chips, and only a FEW coin power plays.  The free daubs make all the difference between winning and losing.  Also, would like to see winning bingos actually give me the items I need to complete rooms and for you to increase the daily chips for every completed room."

        "For a free game? I can't complain too much especially if i don't pay for it. The containers are actually a good addition to this game since you get containers for free. If you're lucky enough you can win a premium tank and those things are not cheap! But wargaming actually give them away for free. The event is impossible to finish if you don't pay with gold and to win a tank you must pay a huge amount of $$$. But for casual and f2p players? I think you'll enjoy it. It's a game guys, play for fun!",
        "The game is good compared to the game i often play online. I could have rated this game all five stars. The controls for driving must have other options to choose from. And its not suitable for android phones that has 5 inches sreen display. My thumb keeps slipping off whenever i try to maneauver the  vehicle. On Pc's much more easier to handle using a keyboard and a mouse.",
        "Hello. I love WOT and trying to play together witg my son. But we've chosen different servers (Europe & Russia) and now i cant find him in the players list to be able to join one platoon. I also cant connect to his server and he cant connect to mine cause system doesnt allow it. can you please suggest how we can join one platoon in this case? Thank you.",
        "Best mobile game I've played, more fun than the PC world of tanks for sure. Only real complaint is that it takes up a lot of space on my phone... It's worth the investment in memory though. Make sure you're in a good wifi spot and have a portable battery and happy tanking",
        "Not a bad game.  I'm a little sick of the unrealistic tanks.  Also the unrealistic play in some ways.  I wish there was a mode that limited you to real tanks of the same time period and had more realistic damage based on the weapons.  For example, I don't want to see the Dracula tank and the 88mm on my Tiger should blow a Sherman away in 1 shot at point blink range, not 6 shots...",
        "Why is 6 of my team on one area while I am in the other. Because of this spawning system I died literally 5 seconds after the battle started. Great game though. Why is there so much lag. And why are my controls frozen. I move forward a  little and then I move 50 feet away from my spot. Fix this and then you get a big fat 5 stars."

        "I got this game about a month after it was released.  Everything was awesome, the support was phenomenal and worked well together fixing bugs and listening to players.  They have done many great things, but the support more on non existent except for those who put thousands into the game.  I've dropped about $600 and the ignore my mails, msging via messenger.  Fun game, support is AWFUL",
        "The trailer ad for this game shamelessly plays Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack, and graphical assets in the actual game are similarly copied from other people's work. And by that I mean not influenced, by but blatantly ripped off. Hellooo lawsuit...",
        "Developer has long history of poorly coded apps with server stability issues as well as loss of purchased game credits and lack of proper support.  Pick a game by a developer who actually SUPPORTS their app instead, you'll be much happier.",
        "It was Great, until the stupid game started crashing every day!  I spent cash on this, and to lose so much due to it glitching and crashing is unacceptable!  I'll give more stars when this issue is fixed... until then if you don't wanna lose your money die to crashes and glitches DO NOT INSTALL!   Update , I wish I could give negative Stars,  it is continuously CRASHING if my troops die due to FAILURE which is caused by the developers faulty upkeep this time, I'll quit and never play another game made by this company again!  SIMPLY FIX THE ISSUES ON YOUR GAME OR REDUND OUR MONEY, YA CROOKS!!!!!!😠😠😠😠😡",
        "Game was great. But now has to many glitches. Hopefully you don't have a problem because the support team is non existent. They never get back to you when you email them. I personally have list alot of troops because of glitches. 1 month ago I would have said download this game but I wouldn't now untill they fix the glitches.",
        "customer service is a joke. hard to find a game where owner/developer cares about their players that spend $500 to keep their servers running. player community great. rest sucks. I deleted this app after crashing almost everyday for a week"

Thank you! Came back to update on my experience with this game. Over a month paying no  surprises, no adds, no asking to rate it just wonderful. Challenging at times than easyer and so on.

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

No way of contacting support/help desk either as just get error message when trying. Hugely disappointed after all the months of playing!",
        "Should have longer time on the tradefest. Not everyone has time to just sit on the game 24/7.  More opportunities to win things. Don't like how I have to pay to plant my own crops on my own island though?! And why has the harvest count changed? Why make bad changes to the game? It just shys people away.",
        "Loved this game and the players in it. BUT if you are not in their beta test group it's getting discouraging that you are not treated as equal as the others and you need to put much more effort and time to get rewards and move along in the levels. Don't start unless you like to be treated with no respect at all",
        "Well the game is great!! This morning when I was using it tho the time it would take for things to be done was reduced greatly, everything was 2 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins and 15, and I was impressed and decided that if its a new update I'd glady play more often. The second time I went back on everything was back to the old time period of production. I was disappointed and didn't bother to spend even 5mins more on it. I believe everyone would find it more exciting to play if the time for production wasn't so long. I hope that this can happen in another update, if not, well I can't do nothing about that.",
        "Gave it a lower rating because I sent 3 messages to support regarding loading error and never received a response just kept sending me to the games web page which was of no help. Very fun game but no support it seems",
        "I love this game! It is my favorite! I like how can earn gems! I love the different 'contests.' However, I tried really hard to get the snowy owl and didn't make it in time. Now I'm not playing as much but still love the game!"

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that's what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.",
        "It clicks on adds with out me hitting it at all. Then when I get back to the app it forgets that I watched the add at all even tho I watched all the way through. It happens repeatedly. It only forgets half the time but it almost always clicks on the adds. Other than that it's a good time killer with easy ways to get through it quickly as long as you watch some adds."

        "This game had potential, but nerds more. More control over your character. More, a lot more, inclusion of the character you create. And I may be alone here but I want greater customization of my character. If I had it my way my buffed dude would be buck naked, and boned.   However I had to say had, because I've played one time. All I've ever gotten since is \"connection timed out\" message.",
        "I love this game for it concept and content but it hasnt functioned correctly on any phone ive attempted to play on.  Currently, upon game loading up, i go to start and it says \"connection timed out\" and wont connect to server. And says the same fore every server so I cant play. Would love to be able to play again!",
        "I must admit this is the first LGBT game I've ever played and it's quite entertaining. The male sprites are very manly and attractive. The art illustrations from the bar are really gorgeous, wish there were ways to collect them in a gallery. I love the way we can customize our main character's cosmetics. Aside of appearances, the RPG content, battle mechanics and character development are a nice niche. The chat needs a little improvement and the server connections are unstable; I often get a connection timed-out which is quite an inconvenience. Overall, I really enjoy the gameI'm looking forward to more outfits and new characters released in the future.",
        "Made in-app purchase but item never arrived in game. Contacted developer and issue was never resolved. It's been over a month and I'm still waiting to see results on the issue. The most I've seen is a couple emails and a review reply. If you contact the developer, don't expect any swift responses and definitely don't expect the issue to ever be resolved.",
        "I love the game.  I played with it for 5 days in a row to get Augustin but now i can't pass 71% loading time without crashing.  I noticed when i changed the server from Tender Loving Hall to other servers it works ok again but sadly all gains are lost.  I wish there's a way to retrieve my character.",
        "I've been having the same issues as some other users. It's been working just fine for the past few days, but I tried to play it today and it won't go anywhere past 71%. I would really like to stay on the server I've been on than start all over on a new one."

        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data..",
        "This game is awesome and addictive. My second First Person Shooter Game After Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation.  I only wish the Game Developers can bring back the game control we had in Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation; especially in terms of the gun control, and also create an offline PvP mode using Hotspot and Wi-Fi to connect players. Putting these two features in place will make this game undisputed First Person Shooter Game Ever.  In the near future, we should be considering how one can make real cash while playing online games like this."

This has happened to me several times already and I'm passing thus information on. Please, King Games, investigate this immediately because I enjoy your games and would like to see this resolved. Thank you.",

Why can't I send lives anymore?!  Thank you! For updating the game! I almost uninstalled this game cuz it was taking so long. Hello! Out of levels! Hurry up please! I enjoy the game, but I'm all caught up. I've been trying to up my scores just to have a reason to keep the game on my phone. So far so good. I just started today and I'm enjoying it! Thank you! More recently, I love it! I've been trying to find a game with the quality of King games in this category and no one is a good! Thank you!",
        "Love this game! It's challenging, addictive and beautifully developed both visually and audibly.My complaints would be:   *Certain aspects of the game are not clear, with nowhere to reference. So certain occurrences just seem incidental and therefore don't allow you to fully strategize.   *There are no written rules or explanations to refer to. Additionslly, the game is not customizable. I was just assigned a random avatar (which I don't like) which doesn't appear adjustable.  *It also used my real name to identify in the game, even though I had already created one before registering to King Games. Worse, there seems to be no way to change this either.  If there is a way already developed to address these issues, please help!",

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Please give us the option to disable Auto Target Tracking in settings.  The auto tracking can cause you to fire at ships your not wanting to target, especially if there lined up side by side. And cause your shots to fall way short or too far if the enemy ship is coming straight towards you. If love to have the ability to disable this feature in the settings."

        "This COULD be a great game, but it's a very much unbalanced. Your resources on you area NEVER grow back, so you must travel... I get why that is, but it takes 10-30 minutes, unless of course you want to use energy. You get 100 energy and it takes too much energy to fast travel at the pace that energy is replenished. If you can get around that, and build a few items, tools, weapons, etc. It seems like the game finally gets going but if you die from the 5-10 attackers, you lose ALL of your stuff on you. Everything I've mentioned can of course be fixed by spending a TON of money, but beware, everything has durabilty, and once broken will disappear. So you will always be spending money. CAN'T THERE BE ONE OF THESE GAMES THAT AREN'T MADE OUT OF COMPLETE GREED?",
        "Great game, wish there was something to gain more energy, and a hp, or energy lvl cap off, max hp should go up like 2hp per lvl gained. Idk more stats that the player can tweak for gameplay",
        "I really like it, but such a slow start, after the initial offering of goodies i just stumble along with constant death, no weapon, lose my bag every death. Very frustrating.",
        "The team solved all my issues. Beautiful game, new twist on an already good concept. Loving it! Can't stop! Addicted!",
        "I still like the formula (except for the energy, I want to play not wait), but... If you're just going to clone Last Day, you could at least include the character customization and female model. We waited forever for that in LDoE to the point where I quit playing it as Generic Dude and never really got to enjoy it as I would've preferred playing my own gender. Trying to call it an RPG when you have zero customization. While I absolutely love that there's no stupid 24hr horde breaking walls like in LDoE, the Night Guest is also annoying, fast and without warning. The game balancing is a little on the tough side, and if you're going to keep it that way, you could at least make the AI stop camping the border where we ran out of a zone. The spawning-in AI that beeline chases you down happens too frequently, and some enemies keep camping the area if you run to the border. Makes it tough when they're hitting you the moment you try to return. Also, AI \"players\" spawning and 1-2shotting me out of nowhere with a bastard sword? I'd love new content, but game needs balancing.",
        "Kiefer cloned last day on earth, but with a med evil twist and a dark souls money grab name, it's has the same garbage energy system, but no adds to replenish it, same \"multiplayer\" if u can call it that (they are ai if u didn't know) and all the sad micro-transaction sales are ripping ppl off and not giving the items perchesed (if u ask me u deserve  it for buying micro-transactions) and the devs don't seem to be fixing this problem or even acknowledging it. But...I am in love with this game it seems to be better than last day on earth with much more depth with the addition  of quests, lore, and the med evil theme as for all the negative reviews I read aboot bad game play seems to some up to too many casuals playing a game that requires skill and patience, yes the game is a grind but that is to be expected from a free to play rpg and if that is not what ur interested in I suggest u avoid this game as the grind is slow and tedious, but if grinding is ur thing this is the game for u, as u lvl up it becomes much more rewarding, and addictive. Can't wait to see what the devs add in future updates (charcoal for fuel would be a nice addition like in last day on earth, more unique events would also be nice) but at the moment I love this game and just can't put it down. Glad to see new updates although I think they missed the mark on some much needed necessities like cooking wood into char coal but I love the fact they added the ability to unbundled progress as I think they have needed this since ldoe was released but better late than never."

I played this game with a lot of people.  It was my favorite ga   me.  Want to play again!!!!                            It now works but you started me over and took all my life's I had saved up.  I was on level 700.  I used to really like this game and played it every day.  I hope I don't have to delete this game because I am not starting over!  Put me back where I was with my life's!",

When you ask for help they will always 1st ask \"is this the most updated edition\", even if you already told them you game is on automatic update. Its a good game, just frustrating to deal with",

        "Would be 5 stars if I could get back into the game. Have tried uninstalling but it still keeps crashing after the loading screen. A Mikaela screen comes up with a Start Download button and it crashes on this screen.  Update: I can't login on your website to log a ticket with your support team.",
        "I do miss the old LOA - Fire Raider style of art and play, just came back after maybe a year or so and it was gone! But, Paradise seems pretty cool so far, only thing I'm not a big fan of is how everything deals with irl money while in the 'old' one you could build up gems or materials for certain things like VIP levels; also I heard about rewards being given to old players like me? That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",
        "Gave you people an opportunity to fix the stupid chibi icon characters. The latest update didn't fix that so uninstalled.  Also do not reply with a generic response cause you can kiss my ass",
        "Only challenging for nonpaying playing. Not a big fan of pay to win games. But LoA is always addicting and just makes you want to spend your money. Not suitable if you're addicted to that overall. More nonpaying support would be reasonable for them to at least be able to compete.",
        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",
        "I'm getting tired trying to make the in game download to download it keeps saying that it couldn't download it try a different line everytime I get to 18 or 17 please help me... It's not my network so don't say it's my network.. I tried restarting the game that only makes it worst I really want to play this game."

I think it happend when the anniversary update hit and I put them in a time challenges during the time.  When I prestige and go to the time challenges it goes straight back to the main menu. And when i do have hero's  in the adventure mode it cuts to them when I pick the time challenges.  Please fix this.  And also happy anniversary 😀   Problem was fixed thank you very much!😊",
        "The game is fine but like all mobile games or eventually gets to the point where it's purely about you parting with money to proceed. That being said even tho this game uses ads for it's reward system it's actually quite pleasant, at no point did it become ridiculous or over the top. I really do appreciate how much of a back seat it it feels like the adds are taking to gameplay.",
        "Almost A Hero is an incredibly fun game with lots of interesting heros to use to battle near endless hordes of baddies. I find myself loading up the game multiple times a day to grab the free chest as well as to push through another couple waves before my next prestige. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this genre!",
        "Update: Ads are broken. I watched almost any that were presented to me in order to get farther faster but now they literally always load up a few seconds, then the game like restarts and I get jack from it. Dudes! Please fix, I am so very rarely addicted to a game like I am/was with this!!  Literally the best clicker/idle game I've ever played. I was glued to my phone for all of my free time five days straight because new and awesome stuff kept getting unlocked."

        "Matt seems like kind of an asshat in Season 2. She should just dump him. Could do way better. Like with Daryl perhaps? He obviously cares for her wayyy more than Matt does. Matt only has eyes for Lana. Like he says he loves our girl? I don't think so. I wish you could choose somebody else to date.",
        "Energy is too short & there isn't anything other than a side game for 100 more points to keep you entertained. The app is basically a story with a couple of nice artistic pictures.  Way over priced. You can buy a book for less at Barnes and Nobles and still get twice the amount in content. The the amount of money they ask for engery in this game is ridiculous. Don't be silly  and spend money that you can do better with. Just play for free or not at all.",
        "I think it's a good game but... Let's be fair you don't get to play for long each day before you run out of energy and have to wait 24 hours and even then it's only a few minutes play.... The lack of play time makes me loose all interest in what I believe might be a decent game",
        "So. This is an addictive store. The main characters are very well thought out. A few Grammer error and hick ups in game play. Although this game can be expensive if you don't make the right choice. I had bought the same secret scene twice and it still asks me to buy it. This is the second time this has happened. All in all great game.",
        "I find it aggravating that your energy goes down so fast. You get a few seconds of free play per day. I've paid to get more. But I can't and won't keep doing that when even paying for extra doesn't last long. 😒"

        "Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "The game itself is fabulous. Cute farm. Good graphics. Good work on that front. Yet being a bit more generous with westbucks in game or making some things more payable with your coins. I get that games don't create themself. But I personally am more likely to pay for games you can actually play for a bit after doing a purchase. And I don't really get that feeling here. But none the less the game itself is a work of art 😊"

I tried repairing the game many times, reinstalled it too many times, but the same problem persists. Hope your team will look into the matter soon. Thank you!",

        "I love this game.  Huge problem with the daily prizes, as clicking twice on the button to speed up the graphics actually closes the offer and no free gift for the day is claimed.  It's a free gift, why would closing it out workout collecting even be an option?",
        "Enjoyable and would have been 5 stars if not for the fact that you can't transfer your items between phones, even with Facebook save game syncing. So if you upgrade your phone, all the items you saved up are going to stay with your old phone. That's pretty maddening.",
        "Great game, but when I change devices, my power ups aren't there! This has happened twice now where I connected to my Facebook and then switched devices only to lose my boosters. This has made me lose over 100 boosters. It is a serious problem. I would not recommend investing in the game if the boosters just delete between devices. I have enjoyed playing it but that is a big problem.",
        "BEWARE!! It's So Addicting! I love this game... Every Once in awhile it will freeze up and close out, but it's very rare that, that happens",
        "The last update is extremely buggy. Freezes and crashes all the time. Early versions were really great, but newer are worse and worse in control response and stability",
        "Game lost all my progress, what kind of app has you log in with Google account and doesn't keep progress? I'm not going to start again for the second time, I'm not going to make a FB account just for this."

        "Starting my second character. Look to all you perfect people out there who never do anything wrong and have it all figured out. This game isn't perfect but have to say that it's the only one I can think of that I have played for more than a year straight and have now started a second! Even my Wife started playing her own character and that is saying everything if you new her. P.S. Good luck if you are ever unfortunate enough to meet me on the field of battle.",
        "The game itself is good fun, but it's ruined by anything but normal missions can't be completed without buying gold from the Gree store, the most frustrating thing is the constant crashes. I am running a completely up to date, vanilla Pixel2 and a 25mbps network and it will crash almost every time, no amount of updates to the game over the past 3 or more years, or my multiple platforms, has changed this. There is massive lag everytime you conduct an action, or change screens. Please, please make it more quick & stable!",
        "Gree support sucks. They don't typically solve problems, or even provide appropriate responses to questions. Tapjoy doesn't pay out gold offers and isn't held accountable by Gree to stand by their offers. Game has come down hill over the years.",
        "Game was good when was under the hands of Funzio.unfortunately ever since Gree takeover, there had been nothing but glitches, dishonest scrupulous non-ethical in-game strategies to trick players of their progress and money. I wouldn't advise players to continue spending or start playing this game",
        "Very slow, lags, when you tap on anything, attack, raid, change base, deploy units, buy units.  Just takes forever. That's on Android phone, and on iPad 2, takes 5 mins to start, then will just crash, used to work sometimes.  I have been playing for a few years, and it just gets worse.  Otherwise would be good, but if you spend money on gold, it should work.",
        "Gree either just doesn't care about the customers that play this game,  or they have  hired a bunch of bumbling idiots. Always have the same mistakes and problems every time anything is changed, new campaigns, etc. Hard to advance if you don't spend real money, but why spend money on a game with such a crappy team running it?? Don't waste your time unless your goal is aggrivation and frustration."

        "I actually really like this game, graphics are beautiful and the concept is fun... problem is, I've had it a week and been in the game 4x. It doesn't load... like ever. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and installed and nothing. It just sits on the opening screen, sadly I will have to delete. Wish I didn't have to but it's just wasting space on my phone now. Otherwise, I did enjoy it.",
        "Its completely pay to play. You have to use diamonds to expand your land, but you can't earn them. You have to buy them with real money. It would be a problem if you could buy a small amount for like $0.99... But the minimum is $10 Its ridiculous.",
        "I would love the game,if there was really something to do, no interaction,from what I've read this is a useless app.i got on after the update today,and my screen is blank except for my buildings,the scenery is gone,black! I am on a mobile and can't use any of the great functions everyone talks about. I can't even help my team,totally disappointed,that's for sure. And I've spent quite a bit of money. I am so bored.Theres only a couple things to enjoy on it.Come on ,why can't you get this game together for Android users?",
        "Playing on the phone app. I am disappointed that I cannot play the full version. I cannot send messages to my fellowship members, I cannot see their cities, I cannot participate in the events with my teammates. All I am doing all day every day is trying to build up resources for upgrades, and those are high compared with how much you can make. You cannot earm free diamonds, and many of the buildings you cannot get without them. Will rate higher when these things are improved.",
        "The game is beautiful, but its a bit to complicated. And the in app purchases are rediculus. I'd love it if you could actually advance in the games. There are just too many things needed to advance in the slightest. It's too bad cuz the game it has great graphics.",
        "Game is great. Love building games. Only letdown is that is pay-to-win. It would be better if non-paying players would have little more easy time with game, like give more builders at least... 😉"

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

This game can be very difficult, I suggest you do not just auto-battle everything.. Take some time to learn your characters and all the glyph combinations.. Its almost endless. You will enjoy this one much more!",

        "Evolution is retarded, seriously. Having to sacrifice 2 other creatures of the same level to evolve makes the game insanely difficult for noobs to get anywhere fast. Come on devs, that's just bald faced greed, try a little more finesse if you ever want to see me invest in this game.",
        "Great disappointment, when I heard that this game would come I expected something epic like heroes of might and magic V. Not this generic game that looks like all other games in the play store.",

        "This last update has broken a major part of the game. Spirit Rest runs rely on speed and now it seems after 10-15 minutes (of inactivity, in an idle game) the game becomes unresponsive until you force close and restart, potentially losing what progress you had made. I know this is an implementation to stop bots but it has only made the game more cumbersome than ever before for living players. Please reverse this Ekkorr! Surely you can find some other way to combat bots without placing such a heavy burden on the rest of us.",

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

        "It's a good story and all. But I only wish they would let me save up energy or at least give me a little more. It gets frustrating when I can't Carry on, I'm not a patient person. Graphics are good. Controls are good. Story is great! Loving most of this game so far. I just hope they change the energy part of it. Though I guess it's a lot easier to read thn most episode stories.",
        "I love the story Line just like I've been reading in the comments the energy sucks I know it's just to keep us from reading the story so fast an to blow our money on, but if there was another way instead of us waiting for so long for just a little energy it's defently keeping me from downloading another game like this.. it takes so long to receive the 300 energy I done forgot an really not into the story Like I was when I 1st downloaded it.",
        "The story and art art great, like in the other game, and I love the music too.  I have 2 major complaints though: 1. It's not indicated anywhere in the appstore that this is a work in progress (there's currently 4 chapters in English). This particularly bothers me since I bought energy so I could get immersed in the story, only to be torn out of that immersion by an incomplete story. 2. The energy system. I mentioned this in my review for the Drogo one as well, and plenty of people pointed it out here so I won't go into detail.",
        "I think all of these Is it love stories are absolutely amazing. The writing has given me inspiration to read more romance novels. But I don't like the energy system. I foolishly paid a lot of money to read/play longer and I'm glad the author and developers get the money for a product I thoroughly enjoy. I just wish the daily energy was 1000 or something",
        "Amazing story... When will there be more chapters?! I also don't like how I have to buy energy in order to not just have five minutes (maybe) of reading the story and making decisions. Please come out with more chapters soon!",
        "Loving the story so far and the graphics.. It's all so beautiful. Only wish that they would give you more energy over time to read it.. when you lose time to read you lose interest in the story by the waiting. Help us stay interested!"

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

Also, when making moves the move I make is not the move that happens. Also, when watching the video for the xtra coin: when the video ends the game restarts taking me back to tohome screen to press play to enter back into the game.. Thank you loyal player!!",
        "The sound effects of the tornado is kind of frightening but I don't fear because all the characters are near as I ease on down the road. The characters interactions will assist if I follow the yellow brick road. \"I can't wait to meet the wizard\" I believe I'm going to be granted more golden bricks to extend the yellow brick road. I'm curious like a lion. Lol. The best for the whole family. Thanks!",
        "This is by far the greatest game that I've ever played! A lot of my friends play as well, so I  can enjoy playing for a long time. Caution: Very addictive game!!! I find it hard to stop playing once I start. This is one app that you're going to want to download if you want to have some fun.",
        "I use to enjoy playing this game.  Lately though, there are less power ups to achieve and more of the movie tickets.  I would rather have the power ups than the tickets.  This is why I am changing the rating I previously gave of 5 stars to 3.  Also, you should really have more of the Glenda versus the Wicked Witch challenges.",
        "Great game but I really wish that daily rewards are better. It used to be you would get a crystal ball often, money and other things that to help with game, but lately it has been stuoid little rewards like two coins or one row clear. What happened to good rewards for players that come on every day and expect to get a little help in the game play",
        "I love this game except for ONE big aggravation.   When you win extended life you don't get to choose when to use it.  It starts immediately and sometimes you've been playing to complete a sprint or another section and you CANT play another two hours.   That means you lose that extra time.   Today I've lost a 3 hour extra play and now I'm about to lose another 2 hour play.   Very Annoying!"

        "The good:  Better than WB1 where the same words kept showing up throughout even at difficult levels.  It's also nice that it shows your previous progress in a puzzle after you're forced to clear/restart it.  And although you'll still see lots of words that aren't part of the answer, the puzzles are themed so you can ignore those non-answers.  The bad:  The ads are very loud and you can't always silence them before they play.  It does not remember your sound choice so don't even think about playing this in the library.  Also, the game now has a ridiculous background that obfuscates the answer boxes making the game almost unplayable.  Finally, there are way too many boringly easy puzzles that you have to go through before you get to see the fun ones.  I almost uninstalled before getting there.",

Definitely one of the more scammy feeling games I've tried in a while. Don't accept these trash games, boycot hard and uninstall.",

Between the gears, springs, cash, gold bars, weapon tokens and car tokens all with three tiers to keep track off it's very confusing.  Heaven help if you've done all the things and are stuck with no way to earn anything.  Could be better by simplifying the buying and upgrading, but now it's just taking up space on my phone."

Just nother point n click, like bleach online mmorpg.  The game that has all sexy babes no dudes, and the chicks beat dudes and practice femdom, we probably get the highest ratings and be the most popular lol.",
        "This is not the game i watched a video for. I would like to play that game (if it exists) but the link brought me this steamer. I'm sure your well aware of this as you've had plenty of reviews saying as much so its obvious to me you dont care. Great way to build a loyal customer base",
        "The game was fun for a little while, but it becomes quite monotonous. The game isn't interactive enough to keep you coming back for more. You more or less just watch your heroes battle which takes a lot of possible fun out of the game right away. If you spend any cash at all on the game, you unlock the ability to \"raid\" your already completed missions. So then when you need items, you will just mash the raid button until your energy is gone. And the energy recharges VERY slowly. You can play for free, but will progress substantially slower than the pay-to-play player. So overall, it's fun for a short while (a week or two), but you will quickly grow tired of it due to poor interactivity. If you are looking for a game similar to this that will keep your interest and has much more to offer, I would recommend Summoners War.",
        "Game apparently 'malfunctioned' and the heroic chest kept saying open free.  This was after I spent $25 US dollars so of course I thought why wouldn't I get some free opens?  I didn't know they were charging me 200 emeralds a pop.  Customer service was NO help.  Hopefully I can get a refund from Google Play.  Don't download!  Bad programming, scam in game purchases!",

        "This game was awesome until i loaded it up and noticed that ALL MY PROGRESS WAS GONE!!! I ALMOST HAD AN EPIC DART THROWER!!!!!!! When i tried to get my progress back using Facebook/Google Play. It was gone too. Please fix.",
        "The game is surprising addicting and offers plenty of content! The progression is decent so far and I really liked the idea of the endeless game modes with leaderboards that reward you! My only gripes about it so far are:  - doesn't support 18:9 aspect ratio - the rewards for the endless game modes could use a boost imo - Only offers one control scheme (there's a game called skyforce: reloaded that offers a manual control setting, essentially the player doesn't follow the finger and the whole screen becomes a joystick, this helps with the game's clarity)   Great casual game otherwise, would recommend giving it a shot 🙂",
        "Great Game. Can't see anything wrong with it. Totally recommend not just ninja kiwi fans but everyone! Thoroughly enjoyed it",
        "I must say that this is better than the older one. However, in TD5, players can buy forever constant upgrades, such as the X2 money and the double village boost area. I recommend that augmentation is needed. It likes amulets and rings in RPG games. For example, a pair of boots that increases firing rate.  I hope my recommendation is not too difficult for skillful developers like you guys.",
        "As a fan of Ninja kiwis work with Bloons series and Sas this will be inherintly biased a minor amount. Now that's my disclaimer.  To anyone thinking about purchasing the game I would say go for it as the price is low (When I bought it), the gameplay is fun and lots of customisation, the graphics could be touched a small bit on but that's me being picky also I would suggest them having faster moving speed for the supermonkey and it feels a small bit slow.  The game is fun and my criticism with the graphics and the movement speed of the monkey should be either disregarded or taken with a grain of salt it does not ruin the gameplay in any way, shape or form."

        "This is a fairly clever game, my son (5)and me enjoy the strategy.  Once you learn the importance of each character it becomes even better. The main negative is it's completely fixed to try and lure you to purchase better cards and upgrades. You can win 8 games in a row then you lose them, it's about that number every time, coincendence? I think not. it's very hard to even get to castle 6 and we've been trying for about a month.",
        "Your game server is from the stone age.  Too slow. Ruins the entire game.  You charge money for this game.  At least fix the server. Also opponents get gems faster at times.  Prob server issue also.  Editors choice?  They must of played it for 30 min.  Played for a few months. Fed up with frustration.",
        "1.The player with the highest data speed wins the war. 2.I wish  mana can be looted from opponents. 3.I wish there is a clan war. 4.Some epic cards are too expensive that they can never be owned by poor players.  Just a point of view.",
        "Hey developers I need and improvement. Make another section in the shop where we can see 30sec of video adds to get a reward of 1️⃣ GEM or 💯 COINS. So, what do you say?",
        "Great game except for the. Incredible imbalance in pvp gameplay. Can pretty much tell who will win or lose as soon as u see the players specs. Getting bored of this quickly.",

Many other missions. Mount system. Many martial arts. Pets. Marraige system. Guilds. Many shops. Nice vanaties. Multiple classes. Definitely a must download. Best of all progression may take time but does not require top up.  Edit: please fix keyboard. Barely works since update.",
        "Great game over time, fast paced so you should have the best device and connection, the game provides most features others don't.. its almost perfect, spend most money and you will be at the top rank, the game is mostly fighting, nothing else.. just fight fight and fight. After the server merge recently, the game usually gives yellow ping.. so.. thats just about it.",

It comes up with an updater error code 121 and wont even try to load. Please fix this as im sure this is a great gane and i would relish the opportunity to play it!!",
        "After latest update it will not install update, comes up wiith ERROR, forums are also offline as well cannot access them anymore. I miss playing this game and now it just wont install the update. and yes my device is now FULL and the last time it update it deleted old info to make more space, Ive already uninstalled 8 different apps to make room and it STILL wont install",

        "Challenging game against live players. Lots of contests and bonuses. Levels of play from beginner to world class. One drawback: all levels are open entry, so more experienced (and less ethical) players will enter into Beginner to collect quick victories. The designers should change the game so that once a badge is completed, players should not be able to enter games on that level again. This would be fair play for beginners, encouraging them to continue playing. Hope this is implemented in an update.",
        "Game graphics and play are great. However dice rolls are seriously flawed. Doubles way too often. Not even close to real rolling. I've seen 2 sets of doubles in way to many starts of the game. If doubles are so common why don't you ever see 3 doubles in a row to start. Don't ever leave a piece open because the next roll will knock you almost every time. The developer obviously likes frustration proven by the childish limited chat emojis.",
        "They need to fix the dice roll. Its absolutely a big cheat...no way can some roll exactly what they need to get out of a tight position that often. Its really horrible it ruins the whole game.",
        "I think it's safe to say based on the dice timing, that this game app, like all the rest, is favoring a particular player in order to end the game quicker. The auto play is annoying and not possible to turn off.. but the layout is nice.",
        "It's the worst game i have ever played , they are thieves , when you double and you lose they deduct twice the bet and when u win they only give you 45 percent of ur total winning money.I played a game and won 255 thousand , but they only gave me 120 thousand , and when i lost they took out 255 thousand from my money.If you dont believe me count ur chips and see.They suck so go to hell with this lame unfair idiot game.",
        "The dice rolling is not random at all !  It gives ridiculously lucky dices and game over in 3 or 4 turns. Do not play it. NO RANDOM DICE, NO FUN AT ALL !!!"

        "Can't win.. sure they give nice daily bonus credits. But the machines are tight won't let you win and after you lose conveniently a pop up to purchase from their site.",

        "The ruby slots should be our choice I never get the one I like. Otherwise this is my favorite slot casino",
        "Very  realistic free casino game.  Most slots match brick and mortar casino slots exactly.  Realistic pay outs as well. Perfect app for wasting a little time at work!!",
        "On December 9 2016 I purchased a Christmas pack for $4.99 didn't receive coins. About 10 minutes ago played fish food game got all cans went to gold turtles got the 200,000 because i bet the minimum of 14,000 and the total was 796,000 in coins made the. big win sound but didn't pay me my coins. Don't purchase this app or play the game its a rip off also today I got a goldfish bonus picked 20 spins in total I had 1,847,000 coins but after the bonus finished it did not pay me on today 9/19/2017"

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

All of a sudden however you guys have decided to restrict those hourly gifts to 200,000! How are we supposed to play these games when most of these slots by default are asking us to bet several hundred thousand credits at a time? And yes, I do buy coin packs on rare occasions, but I shouldn't have to just to play this game! 😒",

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",

It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "Most stories are good but its Very very very pay to read. With weekly and yearly subscriptions. After reading every story in 1 day, i canceled my free trial and uninstalled. I refuse to pay 3 dollars a week. Or even 50 a year to just sit and wait for them to come up with more material. On top of the subscription cost they ALSO have gems you buy and spend on making the fun choices in the stories. So my advice it to start your free trial, cancel it, read every story in a day. And then uninstall and thank me for not spending money to wait weeks for one more story.",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry."

Love going back levels to see if i can get the feather.   Coin packages need to be more attractive if you want people to spend real money and tbe power up packages are way too expensive. Still....... i love the game",
        "Well did love the game not now as it's taken me a long time to get off one level even brought more coins just to get. Only just now finished the last one I mean really come on now. Wat a joke  This why I've given a low rate",
        "I'm addicted to the game. The only problem is that you are not given power ups that you earn. I spend good money paying for power ups so, I would like to get the ones that I earn for finishing levels. Thanks.",

        "Game coins are very expensive and you don't get much unless you spend the money for the $99.99 package I got better things like clothes and bills and a few new additions to my home before I'd spend it on this game that's for sure💵💵💵😣😣😣😣",

        "Not really easy to understand how to get started playing the game. I had to figure out a lot of it for myself but having to do that got frustrating so after a few days I just decided to uninstall it. It presents as cute and entertaining but trying to learn a game with minimal instruction doesn't give a great first impression",
        "This is one of my favorite mobile games. My only issue recently is I spent money on coins after a level to finally finish it but the game crashed and I ended up having to start the game over smh it keeps crashing but this is the first time it crashed without fixing itself...hope you guys do something about that",
        "Update: I read where you stated\" Our developers only release levels after they personally ensure that levels  are beatable without the use of purchase's\".  I was wondering, do they play a level for a week like I am so far trying to complete it? Are they really playing or it's what the computer tells them? I doubt that any of you are actually playing this game.",
        "I have played this game for months and it was fantastic until the last 2 updates. After those the levels became so hard it's impossible to beat them without spending money. If you enjoy playing the same level for weeks at a time then by all means download. Otherwise don't waste your time unless you want to spend money.",
        "Fun game but today while I have been playing, when I hit give up it keeps going to the 25 coins for 5 more moves no matter how many times I hit it. I have had to exit the app and reopen it to play the level again without spending coins. I hope this is just a glitch and not trying to get people to spend more money.",
        "I love this game however, it has taken multiple lives from me for no reason. The game starts you off with 5 lives & then I accrued 10 lives from winning multiple lives from extra spins. All of a sudden the lives just disappeared and I was reduced to just 5 lives again. This is the 2nd time this happened to me which sucks cause the game is fun as hell."

We battle to take the lead and to see who has the most chips! It's a fun and exciting way to keep in touch with her. Thanks for this game/app!!  Sincerely,  Long distance daughter & Mother 🤓",
        "Fast paced game and love it! Chances to keep getting extra coins and bingo credits by watching the short video or I found out by playing lower levels you had completed to play them again to get more of what you need! The higher levels you go you need more bingo credits so this works to your advantage! Great game and love it!",
        "I really like this game as you get plenty of credits to play and alot of games to choose from. The only thing i didnt like was that i was in the middle of playing a bingo game and i lost internet connection and i didnt get my credits back from that. Other games on other sites if something happens when you are playing a game such as getting a phone call or losing connection you will get your credits all back for that game.  I just wish there was that option on here",
        "never gives your bonuses after watching videos.  when trying to get your daily bonus and others it plays a video before you can get them. then gets hung up on boot after you close out.  have to reboot game every time and it still does the same thing.  fix updates please. Not getting keys for watching videos",
        "I  like Bingo. I don't like all the ads! If you want me to click on an ad I would appreciate  something in return, like credits or coins. There used to be an option of buying 3 power ups for 500 coins, now I have to click on an ad. Or buy 4  FOR 1000 COINS.  I ALSO NOTED THAT YOU ONLY GIVE BONUSES AT NIGHT, . People like me also play in the daytime.",
        "Never seen such bad cards. It's way too hard to bingo. You get set and wait for 40 numbers and you still don't win. You may not get to daub your first number until the game is over. Not much fun"

        "The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says \"combo broken\" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!",
        "I really enjoy this game. Ive maxed out purchases on tracks n cars, modified them all. Now its TOO hard to gain coins to open cars and much exciting tracks.. no updates on additional tracks.. think the optjons should be reviewed. Its now once you get where you are the only way to gain more is to go online to TRY and get coins to get anywhere... which sucks!!!!!",
        "This game won't let me purchase anything. Everytine I start the app I get the \"validation error\" pop-up. I've sent mails to support, left multiple comments but nothing happens. I just get ignored. I am truly over his game with the level of support I am receiving, which is absolutely ZERO!",
        "One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.",
        "I think it should have ALOT more cars. I also think that they should alow custom decals and visual upgrades. Also a better online platform. Like a real time multiplayer. Other then that it's an OK game.  Its not been over a year and...it seems like they update this game every...6-7 months, really bad. Gets reallly boring 🤦🏽\u200d♂️",
        "Love the game! But since the update I'm unable to purchase cars/cash. Every time I open the game it says I need to connect to the internet to make purchases even though I'm connected and can still play multiplayer etc. Any help would be great"

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "Nice Game! At the start its easy, like many players said, but maybe they didnt stick through to further their games,I believe the easy start is needed to build for the later part of the games specially if you are a f2p player. Though being F2P isnt as bad here as it is on other games (speaking from experience). I like thier new updates now and specially the \"sweep\" requirement. Thanks Devs! my only hope is that please make planting/ crops a little easier on us common folks,it gets a little bit tiring to have to press from seed&gt;plant repeat (depending on your available field). Anyway, besides this i do not regret playing the game, easy controls, f2p friendly, graphics is good, controls are good. Keep up the good work devs!looking forward to more updates",
        "For the love of God let me grammar check your game...",
        "Very nice and addictive game, i like it.  Would be nicer if pvp is already availble",
        "Nice game. I just hope more free diamonds to be given during quests :)",
        "I love the game but what happened to pk cus you guys are an different company",
        "Downloaded the game just to see LoL heroes like Ahri and Sona on action only to found out most of them in preview screenshots doesn't exist in-game. But overall a fun game and f2p friendly.  Edit: upped my rating to 5 after 5 days playing, you guys deserve it. Keep up the good work. :)"

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog.",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it."

        "Awesome game. just a few comments. you guys should have the stuff that's automatically generated (mining for example) running in the background even while the app is closed because otherwise you're just getting maybe 100 every now and then and you feel like you're getting nothing. would be nice for the money that comes every minute to also still run even while the app is off",
        "Great idle game that you can play as much or as little as you want, even if you only have a few minutes. My only gripe is all the inactive guilds. Finding a guild with an active guild master is virtually impossible, and when the gm quits all guild upgrading is over. It's also frustrating that all the upgrades you earn for a guild stay with the guild so if your guild master comes back after 6 months and kicks you, you get to start from scratch with no bonuses.",
        "This game is actually really good. Not as confusing as the picture shows. Lots to explore.   The only thing I would change for a 5 star it to not stop us from battling after 1 hour of playing.  Hypecrafter NX youtuber Sighing out.",
        "I am not able to access the members list after the upgrade, please fix this problem. I have too many inactive players I have to kick out. Kindly fix this asap",
        "great game, but one of the advertisements with a game in it caused my game to crash, and now i get nothing from watching the advertisements, I'd suppose because its still waiting for a reply from the advert. it was a casino advertisement with 3 buttons, and it led me to the top one. other than that, the app is good. definitely didn't expect an attack from the tribe of stretchy nipples.",

I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",

Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

My 3yo son loves taking turns with mommy and we absolutely love the bonus games! He laughs and gets excited everytime we win!!! I wish I could give it a million stars!!!! HEY ELLEN MAKE A KIDS LEARNING GAME TOO PLEASE!!!! but seriously this game is relaxing and fun! If you haven't downloaded it yet, DO IT!!!!! ♡♡♡",
        "Love the game. It's fun and interactive but have only hit bonuses and free spins on the first game. Been playing for awhile now and not once did I hit the Wheel of Riches or What's in the box. It's bit deceiving that you have to increase your bet to activate the Wheel of Riches or What's in the Box when it rarely or never hits. At least allow those to hit once every thousand spins or something.",
        "My mom loved you so much. She passed away Dec. 18th. She would've loved this game you have. I play in honor of her memory and well, i love you to. Been a fan since before your johnny carson appearance. Wish i could go to your show and play a game for the fun of it and to meet you. Sincerely, Tim Simpson",
        "Ellen, love the candles that light up to spell your name. Clever. The reels in your games are Hurkey jerkey. Smooth is better. Solo, where is the box in What's in the Box? Where is the reel in wheel to riches? Your pay outs are much better on max bet. Took me a while to get to 100M. Keep up the creative good work.",
        "I keep watching the ads to get extra coins and none of them get awarded. I never get the wheel of riches or multijackpots or what's in the box no matter how high I play. I've played SO MANY times on the #Imatellen one and the heart emoji is as big as it gets but I've never gotten the bonus game. These glitches are ridiculously frustrating. Honestly if they don't get fixed soon I'm just gonna delete and find a different casino app.",
        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !"

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

        "I'm so addicted to this game! Out of all the simulation games I've played this is by far my favourite. The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don't have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it's worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.",
        "I LOVE this game, and everything about it is awesome, aside from the fact that I just got a new phone and now the time is correct on it (my old phone clock was an hour off), and daylight savings time just happened so while my new phone time is an hour later, my game won't let me play due to the time change. It says I need to go back to my previous time zone (which I haven't moved anywhere, its just daylight savings time). I've already put a suggestion up on your site asking about whether you guys can put an option to change the time on the game for these very situations, or to install a daylight savings time option so it can keep up with real time. Other than that though, I absolutely love the game, the graphics, the game play, and the characters to which I get so attached to, are stunning and beautiful. Y'all should be really proud of yourselves &lt;3",
        "Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it's a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won't be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)",
        "Loved it overall but make the chats last longer without having to reset them as I miss them with school or sleep. Not everyone can use the app at certain times in the day. It doesn't have to last the whole day just a few more hours  or 10. The games good other than that though. It's a good way to pass the time and has a good story.Keep up the good work.",
        "Im in love wih the characters already! Though, its kinda sad that you are forced to be a girl character even if you state that you arent in game. That kinda took me out of the experience a bit. I understand it would probably take a lot of effort to put that option in, but man would it be cool. Keep up the great work!",
        "I've been a long term fan now since 2016 when it came out and I still play it to this day! The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to! I have been in love with Saeran since the Common Route so him getting his own route was like a dream come true! Although, his route is an emotional roller coaster.."

        "I love this game one of my biggest issues though as it has a tendency to overheat your tablet or your phone. If it overheats too much then it will start shutting down the game and then can cause issues. I've had where my tablet has gotten the black screen of death and I'm having trouble using it directly in correlation to playing this game because of it overheating. This is something I think really needs to be looked into and see how they can maybe not use so much memory that it affects your tablet or your phone to the point of overheating",
        "Still loves the game when I play. However, I don't understands why the bonus games keep disappearing after I play one round. I have to back out off the app and then restart for the next levels to show up. Pain in the butt. Because this has continued to happen I find myself playing less and less",
        "Early levels are fun and make use of some skill. Obviously this style of game has luck involved, but later it is all luck and willingness to use paid items, as there will be 1-2 available matches on the board at a time and you just need to hope one of them will bring you closer to the win condition. They rarely do. I've had maps where the available moves are so few it  had to reshuffle after EVERY MATCH. Sometimes more than once, while it the condition was to make matches in specific locations. Complete luck.  I'd rate lower, but I did have some fun in earlier parts of the game and paid items can technically be earned occasionally. Needing to rely on them however has broken this for me, as otherwise it just feels like work in a button pressing factory.",
        "I have this installed on a newer tablet and have played it for a year and now I can't get it to work.  I also play this on an older tablet that I have been playing for 5 years and plays very well but when I play Elsa creations it does not calculate all that I have matched whether it be one or three.  This part needs to be fixed.  I have watched it not tally what I have matched.  No way to win when it does not work right! I am adding to this post because now frozen free fall does not work at all!  Not sure what happened.  I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it and nothing.  So everything I have played on this game is gone!!",
        "I love this game but its gotten very buggy in the last week. Screens go blank, restarts when making level selection many times over, errored out when buying snowballs, and extra challenged randomly appear and disappear so that the \"days left\" has no meaning. Someone needs to look at this.",
        "Great game that I've been playing for years now, however with the new updates, I can't play past level 1310 because the game freezes as soon as I run out of moves and it tries to reshuffle...and just this morning I can't even play a level without the game restarting over and over again! I can play all the extra bonus games with no issue, it's the regular levels that I can't play...please fix this!"

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update."

        "I do like the game because it is fun.  The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is challenging; however, the new update includes an option to purchase updates to units by way of credits, alloy, and crystals.  The wording is not specific and I wasted quite a bit of crystals, credits and alloy and did not receive what I thought I purchased.  Although I am unhappy and will most likely NOT make any further purchases in this game in the future, it is still worth a try.  Just make sure you do not make the same mistake I did.  I do hope the developer reads this and makes the appropriate chsnges.  Enjoy.",
        "Loved it to begin with and spent a lot of actual money to progress...... but it only helped a little, you have to have deep pockets or too much time to get anywhere. Oh and now it's crashed, having to re install just to see if I've lost all my money!",
        "I gave 2 stars.  I used to like this game but not anymore. I am lvl 7 and the only people who ever hit me are lvl 10 bases!!! What is up with that? Don't give me some bs excuse is because regardless, this is not right and I am thinking of quitting because of this.  I'm a paying customer but I won't be spending another dime on this lopsided game.  Thanks for stealing my cash and my time.",
        "Would definitely give at least 4 stars, but there's one thing that really makes me mad: The Attacking/Defending Algorithm. Out my entire squad, I have the least attacks, but I'm the leader, by far, in defenses. I don't WANT to attack anyone yet. I want to farm and get stronger. But I can't do that if I'm getting attacked 7-10 times every hour. Even when I win defenses, I still lose resources. Fix that. Make it to where people that rarely attack, are rarely attacked.",
        "this game used to be good but they have ruined the opponents. being a level 9 on all  units costs more to build to attack than the resources you can scavenge from your opponents. also the developers are allowing hundreds of absolutely identical bases to be produced so even if you decline an attack and are repaired you get matched to a different 'player' but with the same base. it's a disgrace.",
        "The new event challenge is great but the number of times the game crashes now is unbelievable. To make it worse it only seems to crash when I'm almost getting a 3 star win so I then end up with a loss and lose any troops which take ages to rebuild. Please fix it."

        "💖LOVE THIS GAME!  BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING GRAPHICS on each level. Continues to the next story line and game level without any ads. Only issue it keeps freezing up on me as a new player to this game. I hope I don't have to uninstall it as  its the best came I've come across that I have truely enjoyed. To many games on Google play with kiddie themes. This one is just what I've been looking for. I 💖💖💖💖 it. But if it keeps freezing up I'll have no choice but to uninstall it. How sad that would be.",
        "Game is not fun at all. You spend too much time looking for stuff that it won't give you, not to mention that you need to match 5 gems to get any kind of special gem unlike other match 3 games where you get a special gem when you match 4 or more gems. If they change that I will be willing to give it another try. But until then I'm uninstalling the game and won't reinstall again.",
        "I wasn't expecting to like this game but I started it 3 hours ago and I'm still playing so it must have something good about it or I wouldn't still be here. I'm more of a play a few min and move on. It has pretty graphics, and nice story line.",
        "I love this game! The graphics are awesome and the games themselves are difficult but winnable. Just don't plan on playing through it very rapidly. The only complaint I have is that the story line is disjointed and sometimes difficult to keep track of. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes match 3 games.",
        "Great game, nice to play. But too many instructions to play makes this game BORED. Waste a lot of time. Sorry to say, I just uninstall.",
        "It is ok and worth a download. I am at level 36. The first 10 levels took two hours, then it got hard to make progress.  This is greedware requiring many $100s to play very long. The initial game plays over an hour, then becomes tedious and time-consuming. It is fine to play when on the toilet in the morning, and that seems appropriate. Mostly, this is just another match three game with excellent graphics and a modest story. Skip all the side games, those just waste resources prompting you to buy time or resources for real cash.  Never waste jewels to keep playing as there are unlimited replays only requiring you to wait for more energy to slowly but for free to build up for the next day's 15 minutes of play. The rewards for playing daily go at least for a year, so it takes a long time to finish."

        "Addictive and  overall  good game but could be improved. Anyone that's played for a number of years will agree that changes in the last year are ruining the game. The events pretty much every month now are ridiculous.  The instant builds & gold abuse are out of hand. Used to be a game of skill, a level playing field in regards to age, background & financial means, where players skill level & strategy were tested on the battlefield, now it's become a pay to win game where teams are assembled based on how much they will spend to win. For all the $$ Inno is making off gold purchases, they fail to invest back into the game experience for a smooth running game. Example, the game will freeze up on a player being op'd and they are not able to effectively defend. This issue has been brought up many times to Inno & has yet to be corrected. Players know the glitch & many exploit it, again making for an unfair playing field. Many long time & loyal players are choosing to leave the game after finishing up current, active world's due to changes in the last year or so. For new players, it's a fun & addictive game in which you have the opportunity to meet & play with people from all over the world, but be advised the description is misleading, it's not a free game & based on skill as it once was. If you want to win, be prepared that you will need to spend a great deal in the newer version pay to win it's become.",

Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue.

        "Easy to pick up and varied game play.  Some of the controls can be a little repetitive but not to the point of distraction.  Keeps you interested and doesn't require a great expenditure of cash if you are a relatively casual player.  Plenty of good themed events.  All in all a good distraction which I have now been playing for almost a year !",
        "I have been enjoying this game very much since I installed it maybe about a month ago. I actually stopped participating in a game that I've been in for 3 years for I find the is more entertaining, better graphics, quick response time on tickets and the community is more open. Highly recommend this game; which I might add is for all ages and gender who enjoy space battles and strategy. Thanks eh",
        "Love this game. it would be nice to know what kind of equipment you are going up against in war like you see when you are in pursuit mode i.e. DT, CR, MS, BS and what kind of weapons and defense. Thanks for the great game",
        "Great game with a large degree of strategy. Unfortunately, recent changes make it very difficult to obtain good heroes without P2P. This is most likely going to erode the free to play player base resulting in a game that is not as fun to play. Hopefully this can be rectified in future updates.",
        "Ooh dear ooh dear how sad,, yes that directed to you again astro-(I've run out of ideas an getting desperate now)-nest.  Just had a login gift (cue fanfare) which was 2 pointless training id's.. Big bloody Whoop. Oh an let's not forget the equally pointless (get your hands in your pockets/debit/credit card rip-off) St Patricks day event. Cue no crystal/AP boosters.. Seriously you jokers should all have stripey shirts on with a little printed card with numbers on attached.. What's truly sad is the games good, possibly even great.. But! Greed as always outweighs the gamers creed.. FYI! I don't expect a reply.. Your preprogrammed bots don't know how to deal with genuine critism, nor do you care either",
        "A very amusing game. It has its flaws, but so do you! :-)  At least give it a try, you won't be dissapointed."

Why can't there be a OK option there as well? But, overall excellent game!",

Great for a bit but really lags on... speed it up please",

        "While the overall gameplay is pretty good. The whole game is literally a grind fest. Keep playing the same level over and over until you can upgrade, play another level, then proceed to keep playing the same level again. The competitive mode is also messed up as the opponent gets scores near impossible",
        "Everything is great and good but only have one problem. And this problem will killing you all. That's the loading is damn slow no matter you are in LTE network or wifi situation. Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",
        "Even with a perfect LTE speed game struggled with downloading hunts. The game forces you to do certain hunts before you can go back to the ones you like and want to finish. Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",
        "Awsome game, the only thing wrong with it is that it takes forever to load. The graphics are amazing and so is the gameplay. This is something that could keep me entertained all day and I wouldn't get bored.😺👌",
        "The game currently wont open, when it does its constantly crashing and force stopping. I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",
        "During cts theres moments get sudden lag and it throws off the shooting causing to miss when i know aiming right. It never had these lag bits before."

        "This game is awesome. The girls are beautiful and the songs are nice. There are a couple of errors I be having with the game though. I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won't get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved",
        "I like music game in general, it's hard to get the game right on mobile. but they manage to get it right here. The LP system prevent you to play continuesly unless you paid. But in my experience the amount is decent enough (this make you enjoy the music more since you dont have to restart to achieve perfection). The card mechanic is added bonus where you can spend hard earn cash. I can see people still enjoying the game without spending anything.",
        "Warning! This game is freakin' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging. The circle disappear sometimes during the live show. Sometimes the app even doesn't recognize my finger touch that makes me miss a circle. But overall. It's a good game  .... ALL HAIL PRINTEMPS AND GUILTY KISS",
        "I love the game definitely but with the new update, it keeps telling me that there's a transmission error then when it went through and finished connecting, it said that the data transfer was successful. I haven't transfered anything to a new device or anything like that. The only options I'm given is to contact support and start a new game in which I definitely don't want to do. It isn't my connection because everything else on my phone that requires WiFi is fine and I can use it. Is this because of the new update?",
        "I love the game and it's wonderful!!  But...  I had i don't know like a glitch or something.  When started to play the rhythm game while I playing suddenly the icon that I should press came faster all or a sudden. But the song is still OK.  After the glitch it becames back to normal.  This happen me for 3 times on the same day. Please fix it. And Thank you.",
        "It's so addicting and a fabulous rhythm game. One thing I'm really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don't do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don't know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls."

And I have a pic saved of my pocket pair.   Last time I checked it is impossible to be dealt two of the same card.   And in what world does a three of a kind lose to two pair.   Will never spend money on this app again!!!!!!!    So glad to receive a generic response...   It would have been nice if you actually read the review.  It doesn't matter how lucky you are. You cannot get get 2 of the exact same card dealt in the same hand.  And no matter how lucky you are 3 of a kind shouldn't be losing to two pair.  That just the rules of poker.",

        "This is an updated version. My last post was from I think September or maybe October, but this game is truly AMAZING!!! The story line itself is great as well as the side story's that you can read as well. This game has changed so much from when I started playing this game in August. The events are great but I think the developers can give a little bit better rewards then just XP juice and more jewels as well as heart stamina, but other than that the game is perfect no glitches and non of that stuff. The one year anniversary was amazing thank you for that!! I can't wait for season 10 and the future seasons of Moe Ninja Girls!!!",
        "There really isn't anything negative to say about \"Moe! Ninja Girls\" the story is great, every character is deep and likeable, even if you're a free player each chapter is long enough to keep you coming back and paying is definitely worth it,too. It looks great and sounds great to boot. I honestly don't like mobile games at all but this is amazing and would be even it were a console or pc game. To me this is THE perfect app on mobile so download it now! And devs: I hope you continue to support the game because if you guys keep making seasons,I'll keep playing. Love you guys! &lt;3",
        "The story is really the best part of the whole game. The ninja fighting seems to be arbitrary , as you can have high stats and still lose a match. Collecting new gear is fun but you don't get as much new gear as you would like. Sometimes the game stretches the abilities of my Amazon fire eight and crashes under Google Play add in. This story definitely makes it worthwhile playing though it's funny and titillating!  ;-)",
        "Amazing story! Great characters. Other similar apps dont compare. Im playing completely free so far, just finished Season 1, and many awesome event stories. Well worth my time. Yes you have to wait 4 hours between chapters, but who cares. Its actually a nice pace.",
        "Cute anime girls. Only things is that the gameplay was really simple. I've played some dating games before and usually there's more options or they appear more frequently. And the ninja fight mini game was also simple. I don't know. This game seems to get good reviews so maybe it's just me.",
        "The game's quite sensational! You wouldn't believe how hooked I am to this game when I finally found it then played it. The story is quite good, the cast are very unique. All in all, a great game. Oh, it would be nice to add some mini-games that allow players to gain nineys/gems other than the ninja fights. Also, there were some hick-ups with some of the dialogues where the words don't make sense but it's still readable."

The one above the have supplied to Google bounced back.  The one they advertise in game gets ignored. Take your money oh yes they sure WILL given the daily but this offers. NO SUPPORT REPORTING TO GOOGLE as support email is fake.",
        "This game is wildly disproportionate.... There are players who spend thousands of dollars on in-app purchases and have insane amounts of power so they pick on the players who can't afford to do the same. The amount of resources required to upgrade technology and buildings becomes astronomical very quickly and mining for the resources needed is impossible due to the fact that the huge players hunt mines. Adding to this, every time your fleet gets hit on a mine or a base you lose 20% of that fleet, which costs you more resources to build it back up, compounding the impossibility to grow unless you spend insane amounts of money. If you don't have ridiculous amounts of money to waste on this game, don't bother downloading it.",

Then when you complain, he purposely delays any response for 48 hours because that takes you outside of the Google Play store Return Policy...thus forcing you to either continue to not be responded to OR contest the entire transaction as fraud through your bank.

        "Over engineered upgrades which are clearly done as a gold mine for DroidHen. Result is you either pay to win or massive grind. Defender II was more balenced in this regard but still a huge grind too. I think World Raid is a myth since it has never worked. It apperently lasts about 30 second but I don't know since it mostly throws an error. I've gotten in twice and it immediately goes to Stage Cleared with &gt;97% beast life left.",
        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

Please change the times back or I may delete what was a better game before the update.  Thank you",

        "Nice game, im still playing but it should be an easier way (for ppl that dont want to spend real life money on these games) to get diamonds. Cost for outfits/shoes/jewlery are extremely high 189 diamonds for a dress i mean come on. Only can watch one video to earn 1 diamond thats disappointing. I'll give 5 stars if getting diamonds gets easier or mini games to get diamonds would be great.",
        "I Love this game but recently it has disappointed me. To move on to the next task I have to buy an expensive house which I can't afford (Hollywood mansion). I can't even buy the coins to afford it because the coins are so expensive too. There is no way of getting around it, I have tried making movies and moving up levels but I am always stuck with the same problem. I can't even skip the task! I am on the verge of rage quitting this game.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played. This must be the world's NO. 1 game. Please make lessen the amount of money that you have for the London Mansion. Please add more stories as I have finished all the stories (except the London Mansion). The last thing is that this game should have more updates as in my IPad there is a new version of this game. Thank you.",
        "I really do love it, but 95% of the clothing requires a ton of diamonds that are very rare and difficult to earn but when you do receive them you only get a couple. Also, it's very frustrating that searching for random objects consumes your energy. Please, PLEASE fix those.",
        "I would give it 5 steers but every time I try to go into a Beverly hills store my game crashes and I have to close the game and I try again and it keeps happening also the losing is slow. If you fix this I will give it 5. Thanks.",
        "This game is toooo Goooooood. But the dresses are very costly, no new hair styles, in spin wheel i never got 500 or 1000 diamonds, also i want to have this character a baby. Please reduce the prize of the dressed. Also London is nothing in front of a Hollywood mansion"

        "Nice game but with lot restrictions. You can not send firefighter to take hose if nothing burn - yet or to take wrench if car is still in river. Game allows for max four missions in queue and often some of them not resolvable, as you dont have needed units yet. And you can create an alliance and recruit members but you can not evict them at all. Once your ally is full, the only way to make free space is to leave it.",
        "Nice game and I very happy to play this game. Please decrease new missions time. Add New mission with other sound like public, traffic, police siren, fire car silence, etc..",
        "It's nice game, graphic is good.  But the mission is only 4 and there nothing to upgrade at the max level of 6. Please add in more mission instead of 4, HQ can be continue upgrade and add in more unit..  The game will be perfect",
        "I play both of these games and i love them both! My only complaint with this game is the price of emeralds and the Price of the rescue chopper and the fire chopper.",
        "What are my favorite games on a PC called emergency I wish you had an availability to download units like New York police and ambulance or American Style still play it on PC",

        "This game has had me hooked for almost two years now. There is always something to work on and improve. For long time Final Fantasy fans, this is the ultimate fanservice. I found this game to be more nostalgic than even other Final Fantasy crossover games like Dissidia and Theatrhythm. My only gripe is that I wish there was some sort of non-battle exploration aspect. A chance to explore the 3d FF games in 2d, even if they were brief and not the whole worlds, would be a nice touch. Highly recommended if you're looking for an addictive combat-focused rpg to devote yourself to, and super recommended for Final Fantasy fans.",
        "Some minor technical issues with hanging or loading forever screens... but overall superb job with the idea, and best part is not needing to gatcha for your fave ff characters. Prob the least p2win of the top mobile games out there",
        "I would rate it a 5, but the problem is that after the 6/8 update, the game ended up being super slow.  Extremely slow that I had to set my battle speed to 1 just to perform a blatant laggy action.  If you fix this issue, then I'll be happy to re-rate it a 5, but for now, you deserve a 3 unless you resolve it.",
        "A fun game that makes you think about playing other Final Fantasy games. I have become invested in various characters and I am interested in Ffiv. The sprites do not work for all characters as it is hard to see differences between characters such as Vayne and Larsa. The game has missed an opportunity to create a storyline to bring the various games together. However it is a fun game that makes you want to play the full range of the Final Fantasy franchise.",
        "I can't remain as positive as I used to be towards the game. With the various app issues such as excessively long loading times, poor performance, and issues with in-app purchases, I have soured on the game as a whole. The lack of daily missions that the japan side of the game received with the FF3 Onion Knight event that we still haven't received reeks of greed and deprives us of about 100 mythril (the in game currency) compared to where we should be.   The game itself, when it runs properly is still excellent. And it is awesome to use your favorite Final Fantasy characters, or become new fans of some. But DeNA has treated the Global version of the game as an afterthought as of late.",
        "I gave this game 5 stars on EVERYTHING! But... I have some criticism. Some of the dungeons are completely too difficult. I've been playing the game for 2 years now DIEHARD and i still can't get even close to beating some of the bosses."

There are hundreds of issues that don't get addressed they just add more and more content hope people ignore the issues. Thed new content creates new issues and in some cases makes old issues worse",
        "Don't bother. Pay players only do well. And it's expensive! Devs have it programmed for pay players so you fall far behind and can't catch up. They match you against pay players that are always stronger. Contests are extremely difficult. Been playing for 2 years so I know what I'm commenting about.",
        "Ever since the new owners took over, content has lessened. Although new heroes appear, it is all about money scams and contests. Turned down drop rates make it nearly impossible to upgrade with dropping piles of cash.",
        "Used to be a fun game with silly characters and lots to do. Since sold by per blue game quality has plummeted. Deleted and moved on to other games that run smoother and appreciate customer feedback.",

        "One of my accounts was stolen, I had it connected to FB, Google & Email, I have gotten an email asking for things they need to verify, I sent what I could, name, server, etc, I also sent pics of the name it was when I had it and the name they changed it to, also the guild name, still not heard a thing back? It can't be that hard to get it back, I known a few ppl working in the gaming area, and they say it's pretty easy that you guys probably could care less, as long as you get your money...I really like playing it, I've put money into it, but security is horrible if I can have it connected to 3 things, yet someone can still steal it???.....Very disappointed now."

        "5 min for 1 bar of energy is too long to wait. Loose interest.. when you level up the energy bar stays the same. It doesn't refill or increase.  Which also annoying as takes too long to complete timed tasks.  Frustrating as hell as decent game but as states above is a disappointment. Improve on these factors and you have a decent game until then there's no point in playing as everything is LONG and boring",
        "I love that this game features the cast of Desperate Housewives - they look so similar and it makes me remember what their voices on the show are like. I think it's great that the game can be played Offline and how there is a storyline with mystery involved. I've played most of the game and just play the new episodes as they come. 4 Stars!",
        "I don't understand why you don't get a refill of energy when you level up. It takes so long as it is to full up.... give us a freebie when we hit a milestone!",
        "Its ok...a bit. The concept is interesting. But the game is getting too monotonous. .. and also do something about the energy refill.  It takes too long. Overally its an ok game but there is room for improvement.",
        "Y'all need to hurry up !! I already completed Chapter 14. Like what are y'all waiting on ?! Don't make a game so damn addicting and have people waiting to see what's next. Get a move on. Until then you only get 3 stars.",
        "Only issue is you have to wait so long for energy..  Only get to play for a few minutes..  Then wait on energy!  Would be willing to pay for it for a better deal :) but still gets a 5 star!!"

Would be obvious but most have 10 alternate accounts making it harder to see how dead it has become. The select army function has been broke for months even tho they have updated to make map look like snow and buildings animate faster. Pointless... Lag is even worse and now impossible to do anything when attacked you have to exit game and reload to hopefully have anything left. Theres been multiple hacks making armys instant return to there death. Nothing waz done to fix it. Very expensive packages are rigged to only give one commander but imply that you recieve the 32 needed to complete one. Experimentals fail even at 110% chance success. The players are great community and support slightly improved. It is a very complex game with many things to keep u busy forever.

        "I was having so much fun with this app today after the updated it on my S3 Galaxy tablet! Seriously!! This is dope! I can't wait to level up my grade from 3 & move forward to grade 5! When I watched the ATIS video tutorial,  I was blown away! It seems that \"Expert Server\" is becoming much more awesome with their new feature added in the server!! I really can't wait to get there! This is awesome update FDS!  Great job!  Keep it up! 😊😎👍👍👌👌🙌🙌",
        "This is truly a step up over your average plane simulation games. With Global release and many changes that have taken place it truly is the best out there.  My only gripe is that there is not enough focus on African Airlines. The new update has totally been focused on American and European Airlines. Most African airlines already have aircraft listed in Infinite Flight but yet aren't added. Sad really, hence the 4 stars",
        "Its good to hear that ur asking for our feedback. First of all let me tell that u guys are doing a superb job...keep it up and lots of love to u all who developed this simulator. One request to the admins that atleast reply to what we are asking, not exactly at the same time but take ur time and reply.. previously i had asked about adding liveries to 777 300 er model no one replied or even acknowledged that ur reply has been received. I hope to get a reply here atleast.  I would like to know when u will add A350 and more liveries in 777-300er model ( would love to see air india, jet airways, china southern, china eastern, jal, ana, korean air, alitalia).. please add this liveries.. it will be awesome",

        "Played this game since the beginning, one of the biggest updates has only been made to those who have to pay an extortionate amount.  Feel robbed really and the fact I can't play the game offline, seriously? ffs what a waste.",
        "Well this is a bit atrocious. I feel entirely missold, was shown this app with the ability to fly pretty much from and to anywhere on the planet. I even had it on a previous phone and did such. Now I buy it and oh guess what? It was updated so one can't fly from one city to another, let alone another country. I mean it's pretty pointless at this point, don't think I can justify the additional £75 (per year) to enable me to actually use this and salvage some fun out of it -_-   Tl;Dr? I almost want my £5 back bc it was used for about 5 minutes - may as well build paper planes as they go further."

        "Seemed great then I realised that the 'beta' has been non progressive forever, the updates only include small pirate gathering and fleet adjustment,  never the main things like resource sharing and reinforcement which are the big things people actually want aswell as convenient random fleet losses that either you get no reports for or none of your ships are saved by the warp which is purely for that purpose.  Play by all means but don't expect to advance unless your pockets are deep.",

        "I absolutely LOVE this game!! The stories of each character are amazing! I just wish they had more suitors. And I wish they made more games exactly like this but with a completely new story line and characters. Like, I love the voice animations and how long the chapters are and how long the story line of each person is. I also love how your character talks like a modern day girl when she's at the sengoku era. You don't have to pay to see more about each person either. It's amazing. I Love this app. Please make more!!!! ❤️❤️❤️",
        "So, this is my third update. That's how much I love this game 😂. Thank you for giving us castle and closet space via game events. Very helpful. I don't have anymore lag issues. And I appreciate the diversity in storylines. No route is the same, unlike other Otome games. Also, the relationship development is fantastic - not too slow or fast. The main character actually talks like a real person and less like a \"character\". Art is beautiful, too. I just feel bad that I can't say much about the music or voice acting, as I usually have my phone on vibrate.",
        "Idk what to say, but one thing for sure I really loveee this game!!!! Is so awesome, the chara omg so magnificent. I don't mind spending much money on this game hahaha it's so freaking beautiful!!! And I really love the MC she's so strong and cute, it's just like I want to have a route for MC too. But rn I'm waiting for KENSHIN UESUGI route, I hope it will come out soon. Damn, Cybird always make such a beautiful otome game. Thank you for making this game, it just made my life💗💗💗💗",
        "I couldn't resist to do a newer version of the review, so here it is. I've been playing this game for nearly three months now, and that's saying something. First of all, the story is really engaging. The characters are really sweet, and I love how we don't need to spend money to enjoy it, unlike other otome games. Shout-out to the people who made Ieyasu's route a dream come true.",
        "There are only a few routes out currently but they are wonderful all the same. The main character is funny and reacts realistically to situations! Not to mention the voice acting is impeccable like wow I don't speak a word of Japanese but everytime Nobunaga speaks I'm just nodding along. Also this game has an adorable animated series and it is the best",
        "The most romantic and sweetest experience of falling in love game..  I feel like I'm truly falling in love with Masamune date.. Love his playful side, his sweetness,  fierce yet gentle  sometimes.. The only reason I CANNOT RATE 5 STAR is I cant read back the route chosen even though I have spent actual money..  Its like I'm purchasing the story,  but the fact is,  I'm not.. This is frustrating..  Atleast after having spending so much money,  we can keep the story to be read again afterwards..  Please reconsider this..  Thank you"

Performance is the worst is all i can say. Not strictly pay to win but almost still fun while free and has been for years. I just hope it works decently on your device as performance has just gotten worse over the years on my dozens of devices. They stopped caring about the game and set their sights on money instead kinda sad",

He/she denied me, refused to take liability, even though I can prove it all. At first I didn't want my money back, I wanted my account back. It hurts me to say you refused to help a spending player. You guys basically stole my accounts and my money.",

I wish therr was a way to go back and do the tutorial again and I accidently pressed during the first one and missed how to land. Lots of trial and error on that one. Also would be nice to know how the scoring exactly works.",
        "It's getting frustrating.. I'm into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can't manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "By level 4 no matter what score i get the bots always get about 15 higher. 1 game i would get 130 and the bots would get 145. Then when i get 160 they still get 175 showing this is rigged. That makes it so annoying with a lack of help from the developers make it annoying otherwise would b 5 stars if these issues were fixed",
        "The game has a great Idea to it, but it really needs so tweaking in the physics deparment of the game, on certain Stages I go further with a Bad Jump then a Excellent one, and the wind doesnt really play that much of an effect in the game. But overall great and fun game, amd very addictive.",
        "This game is actually very good, I play a lot of mobile games as its normally all I have time for and this is challenging and fun, the career mode is good and also like the upgrades..  I will definitely be keeping this one on my phone for a while because it is a really cool game. If you don't like ads then click you back button to get rid of it from time wasting or spend the buck to lose them forever.. Well done on a cool game, make some more like it!!"

        "It's okay. The graphics are endearing. Controls and gameplay are smooth and easy to understand. A freemium game to be sure. It openly offers over-priced items like they are a great deal (they aren't). Most of it's purchase items are more expensive than other games. It has a gem subscription but for only 10 days, most simular games offer it for the full month for the same price, while offering more gems.",
        "OMG THIS IS AWESOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING THE GRAPHICS AND CONTROLS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT!!!!!! Except for the part when you raid somebody and the opponent's team always kills you before you kill them. ANYWAYS IT'S STILL THE BEST keep the updates coming IT IS SO FUN DESPITE NOBODY I KNOW EXCEPT FOR MY FAMILY EVEN KNOWS IT EXISTS GREATEST GAME EVEEEERRRRRR!!!",
        "Multitude of heroes to make your team. Not stingy about giving the player stuff. Potential fun for all, as casual game. Has PvP elements. Energy bar system replenishes when level up and even progresses in size as you advance. Should not be an issue until you get farther in, random energy gains also occur on maps with a little luck. Short tutorial at game beginning is torture to endure but is over in under 5 min. Great free game!",
        "Love the game so far. You could say I'm a try hard because I've only been playing the game for a month and a week and I'm already level 52. With 100% win rate and 83% defense rate  have one of the best teams in the game. And like I said before love it so far but for the next update. You'll should add friendly battles. Such as battling with your friends, clan mates, random players. Etc.",
        "Pretty fun game but I had an issue happy pretty quickly into the game and I'm hoping devs see this and help out.  I bought ten common portals for the 100k gold, after opening the first one the game decided to crash and I am no longer able to redeem my 9 other chest. I change to 5 star if we can this resolved. Thanks",
        "Hi, I don't know if it is a hack or what BUT even if my defenders WON then still it minus my POINTS and it shows that I LOST? Whereas the replay is different. And morover Aria's sand in eyes should also provoke the target. And legendary heroes are sometimes not getting worth. They need Interesting passives. Thx. Plz reply 😘"

        "This is probably the best horse game I have found so far. The porportions and the way the horses move are very accurate. A lot of horses in games I have seen have disporortionate bodies and are, over all, very unattractive.  The art style is similar to Spirit. Which was a big head-turner for me.",

When are the problems going to be fixed. This is worse then my beta tester games. Very unhappy also don't expect Ubisoft to help u",
        "I'm playing this game for almost two years, and never get bored. I uninstalled a lot of game's on this time except Horse Haven: World Adventures. At this moment I think we need a Grand Stable for fantasy land, and another land for exclusive horse's, they are so much now on the game. Thank you Ubisoft for this awesome game. ❤️",
        "I would definitely recommend this game to horse lovers. However, it doesn't satisfy me and the quite some Dutch players since it has our neighbouring countries Germany and France but not our own. It feels as if our country is just being neglected. It would be great if someone could do something about this issue.",
        "So i have a problem with the app.......... After we race we should get the pieces to unlock the horses  the amount depends on the which place u get cuz im mostly at my mums but i only have a ipad at my grans (its hers) kind regards Me and my family 😄😁🤗😂😉💙💙💙💙💙🐎🐎🐎 So... i try to activate the horse breeds for 10 diamonds i have 15.. It says i dont have enough FIX IT NOW 😠",
        "It's a great game, I love that I get to interact with the horses and the graphics is good then only down fall is I can't earn money that much and you run out of it quick, and you can't make enough for crops or upgrading, since you have to upgrade alot to get food for the horses."

        "It's a fun game but pvp is a big part and can take a week building up an army just to have it crushed when you log on. Has caused me to not play for a day or two because of this but also what makes me come back it offers that challenge that is often lost in most games like this where is the fun of there is no risk. Not to many tedious tasks after about day 5 no longer logging in every 3 hours to start a build project or something.",
        "Other people might think its a boring game, but this game really fits for someone who doesnt want to get stressed out in a game.. really love the concept. Been a player here for almost 6 years now.. tried other games but still going back to this game.",
        "Should add a few features like: 1. Able to share your battle report with other players. 2. Cancel troops in training. 3.See incoming attack on Hamlets you're holding (Or add a lost art which helps to see it).",
        "My most resource hungry app on the tablet. Need to buy too many stuff to be a top level player. Lately, more stuff to buy and twice as expensive. Don't recommend this game.",
        "Complex empire builder, takes time to learn. Definitely a pay to win. Lots of people with alts and coin hacks. Still lots to do. It's fun, but not worthy of serious commitment.",
        "Reviving soldiers for sapphires must be the most ridiculous idea of all. My handful of soldiers need 2000 of those that are already impossible to acquire. :("

        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points."

Although after this gargantuan update it seems to be really laggy and I experience frame rate issues almost all the time making enjoyable and smooth gameplay impossible. This is especially annoying since I am playing on an s8 +",

I had been playing this game for almost 4-5 years already.  With my issues being resolved I would say I love this game so much.  Much recommended.  😘",
        "I have waited 30min to see the gameplay after started the game. Very confusing.Bla bla, shiny things all arround, see this, take those, listen to the story and chose your 120lvl character. What is the point for new players to start from 120 lvl? How this can be fun?But never mind, I never understood the games which do that. Sorry, but I didnt find this game interesting for me.",
        "Wow, what do I think? I think this game is all hype took 4hrs plus change to download the game after installing it so to even play it was a joke, then when I finally was able, it froze on the log in screen and took me back out to my home page on my phone screen, only to then tell me the game had not been installed!!! Yeah clearly it is as it's taken up space! Not very good I'm not happy, I will try again before uninstalling this game if I manage to get in the game, obviously the review will change get but until then it's 1 star ass I can not go any lower. Sorry game makers!",
        "I wonder if there will be transcended busters in the future. Or perhaps the current arch buster will be the 'warrior' type and there will 1 of each type for us to mount. Looking forward to the overlord release though!",
        "Love the game been playing for over 2 1/2 years. Only one probably lately and that is my WB scores have been down substantially along with other users. I dont understand how going from a few archs' to having 6 and new gear makes my score down 14 trillion? Im bot the only one this is happening to so im a bit confused on what the problem is. Other than that great game play it everyday. Just dont like losing rewards on my wb% when it should be higher.",
        "After massive update and huge changes, I have to change my rating from 2 to 5.Such a big improvement toward all player,either f2p or whales.Congrats Gamevil, hopefully the community will grow as we see now in this game itself."

        "This game is quite good. The graphics are pretty nice for a kid's game, and I do appreciate how there are vents to win power up. That is a very nice update. It seems like Disney took the kids element a little more into consideration.  The later stages do get understandable harder. But after the 100th stage is almost impossible for kid's standerard, but I don't mind it since other games do the same thing.",
        "The game WAS great..spin the wheel, watch an ad, get a gameplay reward.  Great. But OMG now there's an BETWEEN squares AND for  rewards??!!! After you refused to give me back lost features  & said \"Disney had NO INTENTION of doing that in the future\", I had to think whether to uninstall the game, or suck it up & gimp along. Think you guys made the decision for. Too bad, I really enjoyed the game. Thx for what USED TO BE fun.",
        "This may not mean much to most. After suffering from a head injury, my memory was terrible. Level 250, memory coming back strong. I play daily on 2 devices. Just wish you could win gems, you have  to buy them except 22 in beginning. All in all 3-4 stars.",
        "I love love love this game!  BUT....THE ONLY THING I HATE IS THAT YOU CANNOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS...IVE HAD TO REINSTALL THIS GAME 3x's AND LOST ALL PROGRESS! Maybe if i wasn't on level 280 it wouldn't be an issue! You should have this as a feature by now! UGH! 😠😭",
        "Impossible to save or synchronize progress! As mentioned in many other reviews, it is not possible to save game progress, even if you link to your Facebook account. App support website confirms this functionality is simply not supported. Absolutely unbelievable. Just unbelievable. Don't waste your time on this game - it really will be _wasted_ time.",
        "This is a great game and you can have fun for hours. I'd rate it 5 stars if a few things were changed. First, you need to be able to sync on other devices, especially if connecting to Facebook. I have other games that sync, no reason why this game can't get with that technology. Just got a new phone, was at level 346, and now have to start over on new phone. Luckily old phone will still be used. Second, it's impossible to earn gems. There should be special events to earn gems. Yes, you can spin to win, but the odds aren't in your favor to earn them. Third, there should be more opportunities to earn helps. The event to pass 5 levels is extremely difficult and there aren't many other opportunities to earn helps. I'm not spending money on this game. Take tips from Farm Heroes! Overall, this is a fun game and the graphics are cute."

Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "This game should be avoided. They don't care about what the players think and refuse to make improvements or adjustment players suggest. Progress is slow and even if you spend real money your odds of getting what you want is low.  Avoid starting at a costs. It is not worth your time.",
        "It is impossible to have a good team without spending lots of money.  In order to have a good team you need 4 star level robots which even when you do get a chance to get one, you will end up with a duplicate which will be liquidated for just about nothing. Hence better players get better and lower level players stay at the bottom. Also players that spend alot tend to get better chances on draws that are supposed to be random. Wow that's a surprise",
        "This game is a lot of fun. Great time killer. The only thing I think could be improve is the fact that you can't upgrade your bots with duplicates you get in the space bridge. And possibly better mechanics to see the bots you have walking around your base. Other than that. It's amazing.",
        "Slow, VERY SLOW You have to wait for everything.  After each battle, the Autobots need 7 minutes to recover for the next battle, but I have enough fuel for battle.  And, as your robots get more stars, the more you have to wait.  So it is about 20 minutes per game for me. Slow  Then if you accidentally switch to another apps or shut the screen off for a second, you will have to wait for the game to reload for another 2 or 3 minutes.  slow  Graphics is beautiful, but story suck, and wait time is horrible",
        "Updated. Games are supposed to be fun, if u play this game be prepared for a complete lack of respect for its user Base from the devs and a lack of fun events. Even those spending 1000s are bored  Don't start spending as the game is dying Don't expect good support from the game makers either who seem to be on a mission to put off it's older users to the point of stopping them playing the game. Ps dont expect many players as a deception. Pps #saveferal",
        "First off, if you do not want duplicates, do _not_ spend any money on anything other than maybe another builder bot and don't waste any of your cyber coins on crystals until you get all of your builder bots.   So long as you don't care about getting dupes the game is fun. And you will get so very many many many dupes, often times the same bot in a row. Fortunately, the somewhat new cores help take away the pain of getting dupes.  Personally, I enjoy the strategic and alliance parts of this game a lot and the events are fun so long as you don't care about placement on the leaderboard. Having a good alliance helps a lot by the way. Don't be afraid to look around for ones that boot leaches."

I didn't give it a 5 stars because of some of the programing actions available. The waypoints are sometimes more trouble than they are worth. The programmation is limited to 24 hrs. A ruler would be very useful for projections over 24 hrs. But I am enjoying myself, even if my wife doesn't understand why I should wake up at 4 am to check my course.",

        "Getting close to perfection, need to keep the update of wind to closer to ugrib actual, but very happy with true effect and updates, like the new features of wind display, much better for present and future course determination.  Please look to make driving dial a bit larger, and a bit less sensitive, and possibly a 1 degree up or down feature, like the arrows  but a +1 or minus 1, as feature on present dial is too sensitive and does not adjust so refined.  From a Canadian point of view, can you look to include some races like Vic-maui, Transpac or even more amazing and local to west coast of North America, races such as Swiftsure or Southern Straights... short but very technically sweet races that are very challenging.",

I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",

Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",

But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",

I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall."

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "It's a fantastic game, nothing less than what I'd expected. The graphics were fantastic, the story engaging, the characters well developed. However, it was too difficult to earn the in game currency. Perhaps you could add in a video where the players are able to earn gems? Even if it's only once it twice a day, I'm sure it'll definitely help. All in all though, this was a great game as usual. Keep up the good work!",
        "I've been obsessed with Sherlock Holmes since I was about 7. Every incarnation of him, be it the books, the TV show or even the anime has left me completely in awe of Sherlock.  So I'm sad to say that I feel this falls short. As it's own game, it's great. I love the story and the characters are well developed. However, I went into it with a certain idea of how Sherlock should act, and it's not what I got. I understand why though, and it's not too distracting from the game. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The puzzles were a fun mechanic (a little easy for my liking, but still enjoyable) and the art style is really pleasing. Overall, I do think it's a game worth downloading.",
        "I really love it. Just like the other \"shall we date\" games you guys made. However, twice already did i not get my free SH points after doing the required action for it. Is there anything for that? Also if you guys are into the idea, you can do a free small amount of gems for watching an advertisement once every day or something? All the rest in the games you guys make is awesome and i love em all.",
        "The best Shall We Date game by far.  The characters are funny,  especially Sherlock and I love the plots.  If you can make Sebastian,  Jack, Hercule,  Jeremy and even Lestrade's routes it would be SUPER appreciated.  Omg, I think Lestrade's route would be the funniest because ALL of them would rip and mock him.  😂  Update: I still think it's the best one.",
        "I just have to say: I love that the MC is not the usual cheerful idiot that somehow makes every guy fawn over her even though she can barely string a sentence together. This MC is portrayed as witty and intellegent as well as beautiful.  All the guys are also intellegent and quirky.  The stories are well written AND well edited. I never have trouble figuring out the plot due to poor grammar or translations.",
        "Great game, I think it's the best game shall we date had. Female lead is independent woman who doesn't make me wonder why everyone likes her. Guys are great as well, plus I absolutely the writing. It's probably the only game were I was bothered to play more than 3 routes"

        "Its a fun game. Still feel forced in the beginning to buy because ofbhow challenging and tough it is. But I think thats what I like about it; challenge.  but its a great game. Probably my favourite TF game. Hope to have new levels come out soon. Maybe another 100 or so? ;)  Update: I recently had to nuy a new phone. I thought meh, and started over again, but then I thought about it and I cant seem to find a way to recover my previous progression. It shows it in achievements but can not actually srart where I finished. Is there a way to do so? Thanks for the help.",
        "Pretty fun. Some levels are very hard and it is no so obvious how to win. VERY different than 1 and 2 where there was a clear logical way to win. Tournament level: I like the idea but some levels are sooooo hard I have no clue how to beat it! Overall fun and challenging!",
        "Freemium Alert!! The game itself is great. Until you get to around level 5 on the upgrades. Instead of coins, you start having to pay with crystals. This is where you have to start paying with real money to get crystals, to then get any further. Disappointing that you can't complete this with paying to win. Now feels like a waste of time.",
        "I got to the point where I couldn't move forward anymore without upgrades. I can do the tournaments to get items for upgrades but the tournaments were the same every week. Then BAM! They changed up the tournament for me and made it more challenging.  I love this game!",
        "I played this before a few years ago, have reinstalled and now it looks different but the same style.  However there are now now skull heads that instantly destroy your towers and you cant seem to avoid that.  The towers get knocked back for energy quicker than before as well.  The skull heads are the killer though as makes it impossible to win.",
        "Is a typical tower defense game... Bit. easier to learn and has it's own unique system for tower leveling... plus watch videos to earn points for the game got stuck and could not beat any of levels up for me top play.. restarted"

        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy.",
        "Not bad. Sometimes freezes a little during game play but usually resolved itself. The wind is usually fair for each player's turn so that's good. Overall a good little time waster game. The only thing I would suggest is to make it a little easier/more often that gold bricks get collected. I've played for over a month now and got about 8 since starting."

        "MONEY HUNGRY! Play only if you intend to pay. Only got to the 4th it 5th puzzle and the only way I could continue was to pay! Don't misunderstand, this is a very good game. But unless you're willing to pay you have to wait for quite a while to get to play again. All of the Criminal Case games are the same way. Never been so blown away by a game insisting on paying money like this before. Very disappointed!",
        "Great gameplay. Colorful and vivid graphics. Smooth gameplay on LG Aristo 2. Been playing this a long time, took a break and came back. Why am I seeing Ads every minute in the game now ?!?!? I've never had that issue before at all. Now its Ads every minute !!",
        "Getting less fun than ever.  Pop up adverts in game very irritating.  Reported glitches in game to get response to follow self help which i already did.  Constantly bombarded by attempts to get you to spend money.     Used to be a great game by now would not recommend.  Will stop when i complete in 6 levels",
        "this game is so addicting. the only thing I hate is that they don't reward energy anymore. No drinks etc. I just wish you didn't have to buy energy to continue . otherwise I love this game. it's a great time consumer when you are borwd",
        "I played this game for a VERY long time. Recently, the creators have made lousy changes, making it difficult to get energy to play and giving us adults some stupid, useless stickers. Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice! The creators aren't listening to the players and you may want to seriously consider before investing in this game."

And I absolutely love my lil pets and their powers 😊 and the ingame friends I have are helpful. edited: I completed a purchase and did not recieve anything like the quest said I would. Also developers never responded to my email regarding something else. I've spent $40 bucks on this game in the 1st few days I've been playing and I think I'll keep my lil money to myself now since they haven't fixed the issue.",
        "The problem I have is you haven't given the radio toy for the bear and also you can't unfreeze the guy because you don't give out the items to do it even after defeating the monster. You still can't get enough fire logs plus still no radio toy for the bear? Plus should give more coins it is a lot in higher levels",
        "Would give 5 stars but after you get to a certain level you have to spend real money to get farther. I have spend 65 dollars on this game so far and have been scammed so many times. Its a super fun game but so hard to get anywhere. You should be able to stock up shields. Also its stupid that you have to pay to talk. I might get the VIP if some things changed.",

Please fix this.i will give 5 stars back.",
        "Loved this game my planet gets distroyed everyday once I almost get it built. I played several times all day. Loved this game. I used to get angels but not any more. Been on same island for weeks. I love building my planet so fun. But not getting distroyed a minutes later. I've noticed alot of my friends stopped playing too due to same problem. 😥"

        "This game is so much fun. Enjoyable, challenging and addicting. However the only problem with the game is the fact that in order to play the levels, you have to collect enough tokens to unlock them. Now this is fine, if there is something else to do in the game. But there isn't. You have to wait real time in order to play anything of the game. And there is no option to watch a video to gain 10 tokens. It straight up only allows you to buy tokens with actual currency. Micro transactions can be used as long as there is a way to play the game without them. But apart from that minor flaw. I cannot recommend the game enough as it's a challenging blast. Just a shame about the tokens.",
        "A fun game overall, but there are way too many ads. You can remove ads with a micro-transaction of buying tokens or coins, but I refuse to do that as I have more coins than I need as it is. As others have noted, it would be nice if your time-replenished tokens count was more than 10, as many puzzles cost more than 10 tokens to play. You can spend coins to replay a level and get more tokens, and there is a \"super-hard\" level in the main puzzle that is actually pretty easy and awards 3 tokens.",
        "Brilliant game and the only one I have found that doesn't auto fill the 'x' as you play. Perfect. However, as you progress the chance to get tokens reduces as the cost of each level goes up which means it takes days to get enough from daily bonus to play one level.  Pay wall doesn't pay out so waste of time. Very disappointing.",
        "The game is truly fun. Can't play very long because the tokens don't regenerate fast enough. I was winning tokens on some levels but since I purchased some tokens I haven't won a single one. Now that the tokens I paid for are gone I'm still not winning tokens (only coins, but it requires tokens to open the levels) so it's back to not being able to play very long",
        "This game was great untill it became unplayable. Every level or square on the puzzle needs to be unlocked with tokens. As you go through the game all levels start costing more and more tokens. At the start around 4 tokens per lv now after 234 puzzles 16 tokens. That is total b.s. so at best I can play a single game a day. So only play if your not planning on finishing or playing them a lot of money.",
        "The cells are too small to click on without accidently pressing the surrounding squares. Also, on the Galaxt S8 with the curved screen, the edge of the playing grid goes too far over the side of the phone, making it impossible to click on any of the cells in the last column."

        "With daily events and online 3v3 matches; not to mention the addicitve meat farm and egg hatching. It's another GREAT game for the digimon fans, both new and old, to enjoy!   On a side note: I do wish they would add abit more to/continue the \"story mode\" but add abit of a cpu challenge to it.",
        "I love this game, I've been on almost everyday. It looks great, there are many Digivolution paths to take, and battling is a ton of fun. My only real complaint is the chat.. my friend and I use a private chat to talk all the time while waiting for stamina to recharge, but it's pretty buggy, censoring a lot of really common, non offensive words like anything with an \"ho\" or \"is\", and for some reason the word \"ready\" is censored too.. if this could be fixed, it would be great.",
        "It's a good game, really easy to play and yoy get the hang off it but one of my biggest complaint is the grind! The whole game is about grinding to get good digimon but the drop rates are so freaking low! The game would be more enjoyable if the rates were higher. I don't want to be spending so much time for me to save up stamina just for me to use it in seconds and get nothing. Hopefully they change it if not then this game is probably going to be forgotten soon",
        "Great works. As a big fan im really looking forward if Bandai can also bring back the classic old school dot digivice game into modern one. Not mmorpg.. But just that classic nostalgic dot nostalgic game. I really like digimon unlimited that a fan made before where we raise one digimon in many ways. Too bad its not bandai work. I definitely play if u make one",
        "The games is really fun and i love how the systems work. There are some issues however, for example WAY WAY WAY too grindy. Thats the biggest because during events you have to commit your life to the game to progress your gamestate. Additionally if you use stones in someone else's hosted co-op game they're gone despite it not being your fault and with the tiny amount of stones you get after 3 10 captures it adds up. Needs reworks but is good over all.",
        "Most people will say that it is kinda hard to get to mega. And I think they got a point but well in my own oppinion, this game comes with its own strength and weakness. I manage to get my rosemon and wargreymon and now I'm working on my taomon. My point is. This game is good overall but it can be better if there are feature that we can do to enhance our interaction with other player. A clan or guild or something like that. Keep ap the good work and I'm looking forward to the next update."

If it requires spending money I don't have in order to go further into the game, it too will be uninstalled and I will lower the star rating.",

You can only buy hammers with gold which you only get TEN pieces per level no matter WHAT you score OR how many stars you get. And theres a lot of ads. Every time you you play a level.",

        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "You guys might want to consider making occasional, if not regular update for the game, especially on the events. At least keep up with the regular, basic ones. It was enjoyable. Missed the old days even tho so many changed drastically for good or for worst. The difficulty in everything is not really bothersome but if the minor rewards are slightly helpful, they could bring a fortune to you guys and us, players. Conclusion, please give us what we deserves 😊",
        "Great game but when i tried to use gems for instant research it didnt work and spent my gems and i tried to do it about 3 or 4 times and it spent all my gems without doing anything. I tried reopening the app and i tried resetting my phone too, to see if it was just a glitch. Please do something about this. I would like my gems back",
        "Used to be a decent game. The game developers have basically abandoned it and only use it to get cash on the side. No game updates for months. Small problems have been popping up now and then. Not worth the time, the game's just going downhill from here",
        "Too brutal and hardcore for new players. 100 times more powerfull players attack your base when you level up to lvl 6. You loose all you troops and you don't have food to develope new troops and it takes forever to get enough food and train new forces. And you are attacked again and so on. Unistalled game right after that. Alliance is no help.  They have copied whole game from the Zgirls game. Just a little different graphics",
        "Loved the game, except for the bi-weekly slaughter fest, until they stopped updating the game and stopped supporting the players. Spent money to upgrade the bank, but it keeps reverting back to level 0. Been trying to get it unlocked for weeks, but support doesn't respond. Don't waste your time and especially don't put any money into the game!"

(ps. i know, i know, if it aint broke... but I would love to be able to rotate buildings and decorations!)",
        "The gameplay is interesting, and give a a good challenge most of the time.  Not to mention the graphics are just ADORABLE; as well as the storyline is cute and original.  And you can play for a long time with what it PROVIDES---NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE ANYTHING-this is one of the better matching story/games I have discovered",
        "It's a fun game. I really like it. The thing that is really buggin me though, is the grid system on which you design the village. You can't change the orientation of anything (rotate), can't place things the way you want to... But it's still very fun, cute and great gameplay too.",

Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",
        "Love this game spent some money on it but still very fun.  They do specials on packages pretty cheap that speed things up.  Has a lot to do in it too doesnt get boring.  Good if you have a long time to play or just a couple minutes.",
        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

        "Barely a time waster. Very small limited play area. Upgrades cost a fortune and collecting boxes are few and far between and earning cash with off-road challenges is just a drop in the bucket of money you'll need for an upgrade. I'm not saying everything should be cheap and easy, but should increase cash values or offer other ways to earn cash.",
        "Please go back to the update before the latest one. The previous physics where perfect. Trucks moved and jumped perfectly. And the camera (free camera) followed the truck perfectly in order to see the suspension moving with the terain. Now the camera does not stay where you want it. Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics. I unistalled other games because this is all I spent time with. But now I dont know?",
        "nice! im waiting for long time for the game like this... and this is it. but, please add more common truck like nissan navara, toyota hilux vigo & revo, mitsubishi triton, ford ranger 3.2, isuzu dmax.. and also please fix the mud graphic to more realistic.. thanks..",
        "Hey devs, great game, I think a winter map or just more maps would be awesome as well as an option to sell vehicles rather than just collect them. Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",
        "This game suck because it never work it always lags out and every time it says loading trailer it goes back to my home screen. In my review i mean all of this and hope ypu make your game better so it doesn't suck but for now it does suck.",
        "This game is literally what I have been looking for. This is the perfect offroad game. I just wish that there were A LOT more maps and vehicles to chose from. It's boring to constantly go to the same maps. Also the multiplayer is pretty fun. Expand the maps and create new ones please!"

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

        "The game is fun to play casually. Just open it up a few times a day and level up the heroes or whatever. Now whenever I open the app, it functions the same except the graphics are glitched out. Some icons are missing completely. It is making me not want to play it as often. Wish I knew what to do to fix it. Tried reinstalling it, and that fixed it for a few hours.",
        "The game itself is fun, but there are two major bugs I ran into that ruined the gameplay:  1. Starting at zone 500, some of the idle ancients stop working entirely. Then when you reset after reaching 500, they continue to not work even at earlier waves. Incredibly disappointing.   2. When I spent 500 rubies to activate the \"double damage permanently,\" it immediately and permanently reduced my damage output 10x. Ruined all my progress and wasted my rubies.  Fix those two things and you've got yourself an excellent game.",
        "I'd give five stars except for a serious bug after about zone 130. The idea is that your heroes fight for you while your away, so you progress a bit while you're not actually playing. That's the nature of clicker games. This works as expected before zone 130, but after 130 it glitches a lot, removing a lot of your current progress.   It seems to only remember cleared zones, but not the progress within zones. For example, if I'm on zone 181 and it's moving at a rate where it looks like it would clear the zone after 20 minutes, it will reset the zone to zero if I open the app before that. Oddly, it still pays out the gold, but the progress is lost.",
        "It's really nice not too laggy at all. You get new characters all the time to help tour team and upgrade them. And it's very fun to get a boss so much gold and if your away for 2 days for example you wold come back and the monsters would keep dieing.",
        "Use to play it years ago, tryed it again now. Transcend and that Ponyboy really ruined the game I think. Progression is oversimplified and lightning fast to a point it doesn't feel fun for me at all. There is one build that is way to obvious and better then anything else.",
