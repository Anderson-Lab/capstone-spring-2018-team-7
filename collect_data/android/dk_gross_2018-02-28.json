     [ 'Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',
       'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.' ],

     [ 'This game is essentially a pay-to-play game with one major difference-build times. Part of the reason that I don\'t usually play games like this is because upgrading your HQ to level 10 takes a couple of days. With that aspect, the game is more fun and the developers make less money because purchases dramatically decrease. I find that to be important for them to sacrifice something to make us happy.   Unfortunately, though, my phone overheats when I  play it, so I can\'t binge on it. I would like to, though.',
       'Great action graphics and animation. Love the team aspect. Only negatives for now are several recurring glitches and constant tweaks to the battle aspects of the game due to upgrades and adding additional gameplay features. Takes awhile to get accustomed and tough to get comfortable with constant changes, but still interesting.',
       'This game was very addictive until latest update. Latest update reduce attacking power significantly and making this game is not fun anymore. We can\'t even defeat base with 6 level below ours. Now, this game is suck. Not gonna play again, just let the miners fulfill the storages by their own as attacking just a kind of wasting my time and my resources.',
       'It\'s fun, good time killer. However slow loading, glichtes are becoming too frequent. Biggest issue, almost have to buy packs on a regular basis to level up. You don\'t get enough resources in the game to build, it takes too many resources.',
       'Newest changes not implemented fairly or consistently. They changed how upgrades work dramatically mid game without any prior notice or phase in. The result is any weapon upgrades you didn\'t have the level to use yet have been removed and replaced with new system that requires far more grinding now. Old players now have a much larger advantage over new ones because of this change since they were able to easily upgrade stats while now you are hindered with rare upgrade drops that mean only one thing to play the game...$$$$$ sad.',
       'The game was pretty good before they brought in changes to the maps and units. The game now is mostly for people who want to spend in purchasing units. It\'s no more for people who want to enjoy a good game. Too many changes brought too early. This game will economically drain you.' ],

Or implement curse system-when weak player is atacked by stronger one-e.g four times and more power - victim can curse aggressor, and destroy minus one lvl for most expensive in time construction/research. And most annoying bug - aggressor must not be able to use disguise/shield for 1 week after he attacks weaker player, and cool down shield also shouldn\'t be enabled for him.',

Ea the edicts you can only get new ones every 4 hours and there are rewards for just accomplishing a certain number of them. But the reward gauge wikl reset with the edicts so unless you use cash to refresh edicts you can never get the rewards.   This game seems to be designed to favor whales where ftp are meant to be farmed. I mean the vip system still grants massive amount of advantages and events are just to reward spending. Even if you save uo the boosts you get you can never catch up.',

At first I was enjoying this game, however after multiple technical problems with the game, their customer service does not efficiently compensate their players.  I would tell new players to not invest in this game as you will be let down in the end.  In response to Wargaming Mobile: I\'ve been in direct contact with your support group through the game. I\'ve had two weeks of correspondence regarding the issue and have laid out the details in full. I will not be doing that again on this thread. Basically though it revolves around Wargaming not holding themselves accountable for their errors and compensating their players, especially those that were dumb enough (including myself) to buy packages.' ],

They say it\'s a war game and attacking is part of the game and for that I have no beef.  However, the commanders of every Arc broadcasts thier location to everybody across all servers. We even go as far as to tell our enemies when and where our troops are going and the final destination. This make it impossible for lower level players to hide or even try to avoid being camped by people twice thier level.  The balance (or should I say lack there of) in the game makes the history books. The Devs failed on quite a few of the basic elements required for good multiplayer game play.  I would put money on it that 90+% of all positive reviews that you have read were made before they got out of thier newbie bubble and made level 8 or so.  I could go on and on regarding the shortcomings of this game, but I think you get the point. This game is great to playing up to level eight or so and then you will find yourself debating on whether to leave or pay an exorbitant amount of money to compete or survive.

     [ 'Some of the troops are simply overwhelming, e.g. Dragon, while some spells make the troops overwhelming, e.g. Protection on Black Night, Giant Growth on Black Night / Dragon, which generally make no chance of countering (countering is an element for good strategy game). A few suggestions to balance the cards’ power and have good strategy game:   1. Giant Growth: reduce the power-up to 30%, or add time limit to the spell, or disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above (unfortunately Unchained Demon with only 3 mana will be spared from this).  2. Dragon: reduce the speed to 2, or reduce the power / health / attack range.   3. Protection: disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above, or add time limit to the spell.   4. Vempire: reduce the attack / health / speed, increase health loss %.',
       'I like it ALOT, but unless you can get lucky with good cards as a new player it wont be fun for a while. There is alot of umbalance between newer cards and stock cards, you can get screwed unless you\'re absolitely professional with default cards',

     [ 'This game was fun about two years ago before MZ started trying to milk players each month for money.  If you buy a package from them,  which ranges from $14.99 to $399.99, make sure you get what you pay for. ..many times you don\'t get everything they promise; especially with the BOGO packages.   MZ will do little if anything to correct the matter.  Also, even after you spend tons of money, if you wait long enough they will give you the same stuff for free to all players.   My advice...find another game to play. ..something more fun and worthwhile. ..and not sponsored by MZ.',
       'First off to all those saying too many ads, there aren\'t any ads. What you\'re seeing is game packs that can be purchased to help you advance within the game. I love the game. Everythingis great. I just wish they would give everyone time to adjust to previous items before creating something new. And also the pricingis too high. $20-$50 is fine but $99 is way too much.',
       'This game has become a cash cow for the developers at MZ. New features are added making the game more complex and diverse weekly. Costing players money. While old features players are familiar with and depend on break down  After contacting MZ you get a nice form letter stating thank you for bringing it to there attention but they hope you understand these things take time to fix.',
       'This game should be awesome, but the updates just come too fast now. I bought 2 packs this week and still got zeroed as soon as i dropped shield. By the time you spend 2 days clicking upgrades, someone is stronger than you and just waiting for you to try to use your new stuff.',
       'It WAS a good game... And then they started pushing to buy packs CONSTANTLY and the game just gets slower and slower and slower. They don\'t care about the experience of the players AT ALL - absolutely terrible UX and UI with zero regard for giving people the actual ability to play the game.',
       'If you want to be at top of this game then be prepared to spend more than the price of a top end BMW in one year. I am not kidding. MZ releases major game changing upgrades every day for several $99.99 packs. Then you get tge worst customer support in the industry. Terrible software quality control and business practices that mirror drug cartels.' ],

       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).' ],

     [ 'I would taste this game higher if the only way you could progress wasn\'t by having to purchase extras. Having to waste all my extras to get through a gate with 3 keys sucks and so does knowing that really the only way through is to buy your way through.',
       'Why bother having an X on the Level Rush notification if it doesn\'t work so you have to press Begin and wait for the animation to finish before you can carry on with claiming the Daily Challenge. Also \'play with friends\' on the tournament never does anything. Otherwise fun.',
       'I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you\'re stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.',
       'Hi Team my level 716, the 4hr free time is stuck.  I tried to press on it but unable to claim it.  Please assist.  Thanks!',

     [ 'This game is good with a very high chance to be one of the great fishing games.  Fishing lures have short info on that specific fish and some are pretty interesting.  Always have a tournament going on and the only bad part is if your just starting out you may not have a lure u can use for that tournament. Don\'t worry you don\'t have to wait to be a certain level to participate so chances are you will eventually be able to be involved. Only complaint I have no option in settings to change kg to lbs.  Other than that you have a fishing game with easy controls that is fun to play.',
       'I purchased lure packs and built an amazing profile, then they game wouldn\'t load for 2 days so I had to uninstall it and reinstall. Once I did all my info was gone and so we\'re weeks of my time and money building up my player profile. Rip Off!!!',
       'I wasn\'t sure how I was gonna like this game, but I am glad I gave it a shot. It is very easy to get addicted to it. People who talk about leveling up fast are just impatient. Enjoy the graphics and smooth gameplay.',
       'I will re rate game when my issue is resolved. I have finished events and not received my packs for what I achieved. I didn\'t even get the gold coins. It has happened on 3 separate events now.',
       'This now is the 3rd time I\'ve download the game, the last as well, the 2nd time it wouldnt let me upgrade the fish, when I went to the game stopped responding and shut down, if it does it this time I will delete it permanently',
       'Absolutely love the detail put into this game. The fun facts about the fish are really cool too. And it\'s always fun to challenge another person. I just wish there was more room for the card packs' ],

They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',

IN order to even play you will need to Start with chips over 5 Billion chips.( which you don\'t get) Otherwise you will never even have a fighting chance, as you will be betting low and never gaining.... Or get high.. lose all quick. And then quit.. Or You can Pay out of your pocket.. over and over....',

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄' ],

     [ 'I didn\'t hold out much hope initially but it\'s a fabulous game. Graphics are good, there\'s a story and multiple maps etc. Its easy to progress and the special event maps were hilarious.  Definitely suitable for the majority of players and even young ones. There\'s no gore or unsuitable scenes and no constant push to buy ingame content. I wish more game developers thought like this. Properly enjoyable',
       'Great game, incredible customer service. You will never get bored with this game. Play daily as much or as little as you want. There are seasonal (timed) events to play and ongoing daily (no time limit)searches. We have all been there, missed an achievement because we logged on 10 minutes late. NO MONEY has to be spent to truely enjoy this game. Your progress or fun level isn\'t held hostage if you don\'t want to pay to play. Customer service is incredible. I was stuck and the response was quick and helpful. Even when I still didn\'t get it, think if it was a snake, it would have bitten me, they helped and never made me feel stupid. Install NOW and start having fun.',
       'Energy is spent too quickly, kind of their way of trying to make you to buy gems. I get it, and I would buy them if they weren\'t so expensive! I can barely make it through a single task, it does get quite annoying.   Maybe give us the option of watching ads for gems or extra energy, and an ad free option with minimal cost so those who would rather not have the ads get to benefit too?',
       'Love the challenge,  the mini puzzles.  The only draw back I would say.  As a new player having enough energy to complete some of the old challenges example (Valentine\'s 2017) is almost impossible.  Would love to figure out how to gain more energy. Fan page as far as I can see does not help on this.  Other then  that very enjoyable game.',
       'Hi, really like the game, but I\'ve just done the new jungle story and on completion of the story received a lot of gummy worms for energy, carried on playing, closed and came back to the app 30 mins later and they have all disappeared?? Could you please put these back in my rucksack so I can use them, was over 60, 000 energy that I have just lost, please sort this out as I love this game and I can then give it 5 stars, many thanks, Louise Anderson',
       'The instructions go by too fast,no where to look to repeat them so levels quests left half done. For example can\'t free the florists because not sure how to finish with the light beams??! Missed the hints or instructions.' ],

     [ 'Great, but really needs "sell all" function for dealing with store house and "pecial buildings" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?',
       'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can\'t agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won\'t run bored of it.',
       'The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.',
       'Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!',
       'Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far.

       'Support staff not good. I was leveled in the 680 range and won the "camel race" three times and did not receive any free hours or boosters twice like I did the first time. I contacted support and they said my version was not updated to the current version. When I went to play store there was no available updates. I contacted support again and they sent me a multitude of things to try. I don\'t feel like I have to do all this to play a game. They never offered to even give me anything for winning. When I won it again today...I get nothing again. I played this game for years and never had issues like this before. This game is not worth the hassle. Uninstalling it now, there are too many similar games out there that I won\'t have to stress or get mad about. Thought these games were supposed to be relaxing.',

That needs to be changed then maybe I will give it 5 stars  This games keepa force closing on me. Most of the time it\'s right in the middle or almost at the end of the game so therefore I have lost a turn or even the game when I\'m about to shoot my last ball...... I love this game and I don\'t want to delete it.... FIX THIS PLEASE',

They give you a lot of balls of the color you really dont need so you shoot balls in random directions because you need to get rid of them. Sometimes I feel they are setting you up to lose. The aim is off unless you use the aim perk so if Its a further distance Im shooting it blindly. Great talk.',

     [ 'I LOVE this game ... like I am so hooked.... I spend way too much money though because I love all the dragons so much just so adorable I always buy the dragon bundles.   It does suck whenever you get so high up with feeding your dragons then it costs a lot of food to feed them like if I didn\'t buy so many dragon bundles I would have a hard time feeding them to higher levels... Even now it\'s hard.  Anyways I am addicted to this game though other than that!  ♡♡',
       'This game is so bad I almost died of cuteness from the dragons. Firstly: you could try to make a breeding guide to help plays find what dragons to breed so they get their dragon the want. Secondly: the dragon and animations are just wonderful and adorable. Lastly: I would definitely recommend this to be installed by lovers of dragons and fantasy or anything like an interesting of this game. Even if the person hasn\'t got interest in would suggest them to try it because it\'s really fun',
       'This game is very addictive, fun, and a great game over all. Eventually if you play it long enough there isn\'t much you can do on the app until you wait but other then that it\'s a decent time killer. I haven\'t ran into any issues with the game and I recomended installing it',
       'Honestly a great game. It has ads but those are optional. You only view ads if you want some extra stuff. You click on a button to view the ads and after, depending on what you picked you wanted, you get. So please don\'t think that the ads just randomly pop-up out of nowhere. They only appear if you choose for them to be there. I\'d say download the game, you won\'t regret it 👍',
       'It would be better if I didn\'t have to clear cache and data on Google play store and change my display settings every time an update is released just to be able to update the game. I love the game other than that but it\'s a pain to have to make these changes and then have to reset the settings in play store and for display to be able to use my device properly. When that issue is fixed... I\'ll for sure give it 5 stars.',
       'Can\'t continue my game windows 10 laptop game progress. Can\'t you make just one little thing? I also lost my game progress in the same way for another game developed by Gameloft. Why game progress is so big issue for you always? I tried all the ways that I possibly can. Still unable to continue game. This is my second time i\'ve made mistake  by playing your game.' ],

     [ 'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'I love this game but, I download it several times! And the download process is always stop at 98.8% and not finishing. And its say Download Error please check your connection setting! But my wifi connection is fine.Please help me ASAP i want this game so much',

But mine was gone i\'m about to buy a new phone so I was trying to save my game data but.. After a few attemps.. My game restarted from the introduction race... On the first crash the game was stable until i loaded my brothers save data.. Then it was crashing again at went back to the introduction race... Now i deleted the game.. Please help me..

     [ 'I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I\'ve hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it\'s all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn\'t immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It\'s very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!',
       'Used to be fun to play when there were decent rewards. For some reason the comp room rewards are gone besides small discount options. Ticket rewards are available for shows nobody would want to pay to see.  I have been playing for a few years now and have saved up quite few loyalty points. I guess we are playing for an occasional comp buffet. What a shame',
       'I like this game..but once i got to a certain level my daily bonus stopped going up.  It has reamined the same and it would be a little more exciting if it would increase the higher you go.  Win or lose is ok with me, it\'s something to pass free time.',
       'Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I\'ve been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it\'s not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it\'s supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it\'s just a game, it\'s for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that\'s not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?',
       'Great game at first but when you progress you pretty much play for 10 minutes wait for bonus. Started purchasing chips and then they seem to go quicker! I like that is not all win win but damn, throw a dog a bone every once in a while. Basically you throw money away paying for chips and NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER win!',
       'I\'m sick of only being able to play for ten minutes at a time. Would love this game more if I can actually play it but you hardly can win coins, and if you do it\'s a quarter of what you spent on spinning it, and can hardly get coins. If you had more ways to get extra coins rather than paying like watching an ad, or something then that would be cool. Or if they made it so one could not lose 500k in ten minutes while only winning a total of like 5k that would be great cuz I would actually then enjoy it.' ],

       'I\'ve been playing this game for quite sometime. It\'s addictive and fun. But it can cut out after a tough level and not give you a chance to find a key. Very frustrating. Also, I don\'t see a benefit in getting an outfit for the 20 gem chest. I\'m tempted to uninstall the game now that my gems were wasted.',
       'its your average match 3 game with the Angry Birds brand added to cash in on the match 3 craze. There are only 3 adult birds playable (Red, Chuck. and Bomb). There are events to unlock outfits for the happy hatchling...but thanlfully you dont have to do that if you dont wanna. As someone that HATES ads, I dont recall any so there mau not be any od they dont irritate me.  oh and batteru cpnsumption is not very high. hope this help',

       'I\'m enjoying the game play but it really seems to lag between levels. I\'m waiting 15-30 seconds for it to load the next screen after the end of a level then another 15-30 seconds for the level to load. I spend a lot of time staring at a white screen. I\'ll keep playing but I\'d love to see faster loading.',
       'It\'s VERY addictive. I don\'t even know what to do with myself when I run out of loves. It can be a bit laggy during the start up screen or beginning of levels but it doesn\'t take too long or shut off so that\'s a win.' ],

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.' ],

     [ 'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.',
       'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.' ],

     [ 'I freaking love this game! However I have a small complaint that is probably fixable. I was wondering for my lg g6 if you could expand the borders so the screen would fit. And if the screen is not able to get any bigger, I\'m hoping you people can at least put a cool border around it instead of leaving it as a black bar. I know you people can make cool borders. Thanks for your attention!',
       'I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn\'t really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.',
       '[Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!',
       'I played this game when it first came out. I quit a couple weeks later due to repetitiveness and not being able to continue due to weak medals and a year or two later I come back with tons of jewels. I had over 30000 waiting in the mail. Used them all and got some really good medals but when new medals are released its really hard go earn them due to the slow rate and cost. Buying them is overpriced. Pretty much one draw of 3000 jewels is 30$ for a chance at the new medal. This game is really a pay 2 win game and prices are just too much.',
       'It is so addicting but when I first got the game. I only had one problem with it and thats when it is downloading. It takes forever and just to get the app I had to delete almost everything. (BTW I have a 8gb phone and that didn\'t  work well for me. But I got it too work.)',
       'Don\'t get me wrong. I love this game entirely kingdom hearts is life. But it\'s funny that in the description it says it\'s the first mobile app for the kingdom hearts seires. Maybe I\'m wrong but I thought Coded was for the phone. Which would make this game the second mobile app x.x' ],

     [ 'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It\'s perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven\'t had any problems with it. I can\'t wait for updates later on to come.',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'Played this game on my old 6S and S7 edge without any problems. Now that I have a Pixel 2 XL, controls have a major glitch. Seems to go nuts on its own or sticks too one side of the screen. Happens every match, almost unplayable. Very disappointing!' ],

     [ 'There was a time when you can still feel the dev team\'s gratitude for you choosing their game. But now, its just one paywall after another. Whatever they used to give for free in the past years, they\'ve found a way to turn into cashcrop. I\'ve never been closer to deleting this game than when the latest update came out. If you\'re not a VIP, uninstall it now. They\'ve made a fool out of us.',
       'Well I have played this game from the beginning. And it has been a solid game. The evolution of the game has been astounding for the most part. I have had my ups and downs with it over the years. Yet overall it has been the one game I could never fully quit. I have taken my time from the game a few times. But, every time I come back. It feels as fresh and new as the first time I logged in. And in the world of micro-transactions, Netmarble has been one the most generous companies out there. Thanks for making a solid, fun game featuring characters I grew up reading and loving.',
       'Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don\'t already have this, stay away.',
       'I love this game. I truly do. That\'s why this hurts. With the Adam Warlock update, I knew I had to be ready to save up crystals, though I did intend to spend a few for new uniforms, but hiding the one for the update\'s protagonist behind 5.5k crystals is a new low, and you haven\'t even soothed the slap on our faces from the Ultimates\' update. I was prepared to buy a new subscription for crystals or bios, but not anymore.  Netmarble, I thought you better than this. You had a good, committed following, yet you abuse us like this.',
       'An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn\'t thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that\'s what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can\'t get bored of it.',
       'Updates? Updating means improving something, you\'re just digging a bigger hole NM.. I used to spend £10 a month on this, now it\'s not even enough to unlock the new characters... Many of my free to play friends stopped playing, and I\'m 1 update of following them.. Just can\'t be bothered with the grind, and the other option is pumping money into it. That\'s not gonna happen anymore.' ],

     [ 'I haven\'t unlocked many locations yet, but in most of them the objects fit fine. There\'s one where music instruments get stuck to people\'s clothes that\'s a bit off. As I started during an event, my quests got a bit jumbled up but I don\'t mind. So far the game hits the spot for me.',
       'The only improvements I would like to see is making it easier to view on my phone.  I actually got reading glasses just for this,  but it\'s still killing my eyes.  If I could even zoom in a little more,  maybe. Also, I\'m a cheapo, so missing out on Facebook & other perks by not paying or not connecting.  I want to play, not embroil myself in social media.  Still, LOVE this game!!',
       'This game is amazing! Most games of this style sacrifice story for the sake of puzzles, or vice versa, but this is a perfect balance and blend of both. I was hooked from the first moment, and the briliant and individual characters and challenging - but not impossible - puzzles have kept me eagerly impatient to play more. (My only complaint is that the energy refill feels SO SLOW when all I want to do is play more!)',
       'I\'d give 5 stars for everything if the new update would work. It continues to crash. I love this game and wish I could play. I\'m also loosing 2 days of a boost item b/c I can\'t play ANY level.',
       'I was really enjoying the game, it\'s fun. Don\'t get me wrong. But I\'ve signed in every day, every single day and I make sure I do, and sometimes I do it from my iPad and sometimes I do it from my phone. And sometimes it lags and says I missed a day before it fixes. But today I signed in and it told me I missed a day. So I tried it on my phone and it still said I missed a day so I had to restart from the first day in the current collection item. I\'m very frustrated and upset by this. So this whole \'signing on from a different device\' thing is glitchy af and my game got messed up because of it. Very upsetting. Otherwise it would be a 5star.',
       'I usually love this game but it\'s having issues the lastt day and a half that keep me from playing. I\'m losing quest time and my daily bonus because of it. No other apps are giving me trouble but this one. Ugh!' ],

     [ 'This is hands down the most F2P friendly game I come across to. I mean you can pay some useful stuff but this game leans more on casuals/f2p. The graphics is nice,story is ok,gameplay so far have been really grindy as expected of an Korean rpg and yeah a casual friendly game. So far my only concern is the toxicity of the world chat. Where and how do I report those players?',
       'Even if this isn\'t your style of game I would recommend giving it a try. Truly a magnificent piece of work backed by an excellent company. Vespa strives to provide players with a fulfilling experience in all aspects of this products. There are some things which could use adjustments, like the state of PvP for example, yet I have no doubt that like everything else so far they are receiving and acting based on feedback of their customer base. All other mobile companies could stand to learn something from Vespa.',
       'Amazing first mobile game to hold my attention, great animations, epic fighting, and a strong story. Always something to do my only complaint would be cash shop is really pricey needs to go way down, $80-100  for a mobile game hero is outrageous i could just get a console/pc game but you can grind everything for free and there is decents sales and events',
       'This game is one of the most f2p friendly. All game content is available to get without spending cash. The community is good too since you can chat with other players when playing, and can join multiplayer raid. It may a bit hard to reach top ranks in arena with f2p, but pvp is not the main content in this game so most players dont bother too much with it.',
       'You guys reserved *5 just like my epis UW HAHAHA. Good work, thanks for your hardwork. I don\'t know you guys read this comment or not, but keep up your great work and thank you. For everything, and your daily motivation in game mail every hot time. Hope this comment also made your day.',
       'since the game first started (1 yr ago) they\'ve added 20 characters and 1 (!?) storyline chapter. if you\'re looking for actual content, this is not your game. if you only care about collecting characters and outfits and making strong for no reason (since there\'s nothing to do but pvp endlessly), then this is THE game. ugh!' ],

     [ 'Money grab. Unless you have $300 a week to spend on this never ending money pit, you will never go anywhere in this game. You can only get so far, then you a required to spend actual cash to continue playing. If you want to max out your base you better have DEEP pockets. This is not a joke, if you want to be a serious player, it will cost you around $300 a week just to keep up. Only the rich get anywhere in this game.',
       'Mobile Strike has reset game.   Nothing below cyber troops are being supported , no RSS .   Also.  One cyber Titan can zero anything that has highest normal T52 troops and best bio titans...... without sending a commander Once u reach building level 1100 offered for less than 19.99 USDyou will have no access to packs less than $100 USD and no access to RSS for older troops',
       'I use to have one of the strongest bases in MKST.. Mistress Vixen..nickname Vix.  Anyhow i have spent easily around $3,000 us dollar on this game. And one day my shield lapsed and I got zeroed after about 40 plus hits. I quit playing. I started back and spent  littke money cause I missed my alliance people I started to consider family after almost a year of play.  Anyhow now they came out with cybernetics and the packs for that are $99.00 everytime. I\'m sorry this has went to far. This is a pay to play game 100%.',
       'Lots to do to increase your power, tons of new buildings giving massive power boosts, just wait a little bit & you may get lucky with a $99 pack being reduced to $19. Make sure you have plenty of money for this game. If you don\'t have the money, then starting out new, you\'ll be at a stand still around HQ level 20 & commander level 50, with only increasing power by researching, training more troops, & building traps for your wall. This game has been slowing down a lot lately though, not sure if it\'s the game or my phone causing it.',
       'U spend money to get ready for war.I think I am ready too go to cp and look at the other players base and think I am going to die. Their lvl and power are bigger than mine, so I spend more money an that still don\'t help for the event this game is starting to suck. My res base I have never spent no then on it and I have it Hq lvl 350 what is up with that. Helping a base who has not spent no money. Help the people who has spent money',
       'I had a problem with my peace shield  dropping for no reason. Mobile Strike says it\'s because I activated a boost reduction of food rss. I received no notification of this other. Thanks shield was replaced. Gave me no explanation as to why it had been replaced. I don\'t have Titans blue print no need for me to activate Titan boost . Game glitching and I was attacked when my 30 day shield dropped for no reason. MS did nothing about it. MS gives awful customer service. I spend my hard earned money every month. I should get what I pay for.' ],

Want a game to kill time, literally,  this it. Enjoy and good luck! Update..OK so I spent 5 diamonds to try and get extra spins which I did and won 30 free spins, I was betting 250k and won a whopping 1.5 mill out of 30 spins. Really? Come on! I understand greed but 30 spins and won what was equivalent to 7 free spins. Sheesh this is suppose to be fun right? Played the latest table for almost an hour on all bets and NOT 1 bonus game.

     [ 'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.',
       'I want to report a glitch. I betted 3 parts, titan, drill, and a repulse. I lost on thd bet, and guess what? The titan car still had that tick on on it, then i got those stickers on the car unlimited. It took me 5 minutes to get back to normal. Please dont use this peopole.' ],

     [ 'Excellent for including LGBTQ stories, thank you. Also the storyline are interesting and sweet. However, the missing of 1 star to full score is due to long waiting and expensive ticket. I don\'t mind to pay for tickets to support the game but it is quite costly for me. Nevertheless, great game! Keep up the good work and more LGBTQ stories please.',
       'Great app, however if you\'ve completed a story from start to finish, you should be able to play it again for free without the need for tickets. Fix that and I will rate more stars. Also the time for tickets to regenerate should be 1 hour per ticket, or if you\'re insistent on it being 2 hours, increas the maximum amount of accumulated tickets to 4.',
       'I like the idea of the app, but it doesn\'t tell me hiw to get tickets or hearts which means that I can\'t choose romance options which is why I\'m playing on this app as is pretty obvious by the title. My second issue is that I cannot access my last play point on the stkry I\'m in, I keep getting sent back to the prolouge and then after i finish the prolouge again it sends me back to the main menu. Overall, I had a pretty good time playing (except I didn\'t have any hearts), but the navigation of this app is horrendous and I refuse to pay for hearts (which seems to be the only way to get them)',
       'I love the the stories and the graphics, but I wish you didn\'t have to spend hearts to pick some of the choices. Hearts are hard to get (unless you pay for them) and then it always costs so many hearts to use these choices. A lot of times I want to delete the app just because of this, because I can\'t afford to keep buying hearts so I can pick better choices.',
       'Absolutely love this game! My favorites are Astoria and Gangsters in Love! It\'s a great app, but lately I haven\'t been able to play it due to it loading but I\'m not able to push anything or choose a character. Is anybody else having this problem?',
       'The game is really fun. Lots of great stories and I love the new stories. The only thing I dislike is how long we have to wait to get 1 ticket. For example I waited 2 hours and 15 minutes for 1 ticket. Then after a 2-4 minutes episode I have to wait 2 hours again.  The only thing I wished is for the waiting limit not be so long. Besides that, the game is extremely additive and is great! My favorite One is Antares. Can\'t wait for season 4! Amazing game!!' ],

     [ 'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',
       'I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I\'ve used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I\'ve recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The \'free\' diamonds doesn\'t work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn\'t pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn\'t anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these....',
       'One ticket is too little.. plus the stories for each ticket are soooo short... other apps have it longer and you get 2 tickets minimum before the next ticket arrives.. and owh... can the characters have more options in terms of looks? Especially the guys... boring.. Plus why cant we keep the clothes that we already purchased? Stories are ok.. similar most of them..',
       'Not a bad game I like the stories. The only thing is you only get 1 ticket to read with. On the plus side you can speed up time til the next ticket',
       'The stories are great but unless you invest a ton of money into the game you don\'t really have a choice how the story will turn out. Whenever it pops up to give you a choice, the more favorable one is 20 diamonds which you will only possibly get if you buy them. It ruins the whole concept of the game.' ],

       'I\'ve always liked the design of the different factions and creatures in the HOMM series of games, so it\'s nice to find a game which focuses more on them.  Graphics are great and the menus are easy to navigate. My only grievance is that the RNG aspects of the game can let you down more often than not, but it\'s not a deal-breaker for me. Awesome game, I definitely recommend giving it a try!' ],

Other than that, it\'s a pretty decent game',

My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on "finish daily or unfurnished daily", I can\'t seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.',
       'Its a good game. One of the nicest mmorpg on the market right now. However, my only nitpick is the lack of customization of the characters. You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn\'t change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.',

It really anoys me b/c I\'m a girl and only the boy characters are visible so please fix tgis in the next game update! That\'s the only bug that I have experienced! Anyways everyother thing is *AWESOME* btw my character is the puppeteer if that helps in something',
       'This is actually a very good mmorpg game, i\'d like to say it\'s the best mmorpg, but, the bug isn\'t fixed yet, i can\'t see my character when playin, also the puppeter and bountu hunter. Fix this bug quickly, i want to play this game so bad. I can\'t enjoy the gameplay if the characters are invisible.',
       'Apparently, my first review is gone. It was just a few minutes ago. So basically, I wanted to create a puppeteer but it does not show the avatar in the character creation screen. Same thing goes with the bounty hunter. I\'ve restarted the app, my phone, and re-installed the game. It\'s the same thing. I only see the scythe and shadow for the puppeteer and shadow for the bounty hunter. I\'m not gonna play this game until this issue is fixed.' ],

     [ 'When i was playing i watched vids for gems and hot 16 gems and then i spent 1 gem to speed up process of food. Then the game says a error occoured and told me to reload it. So I did and when it finished reloading, my gems were at zero and the gem i used to speed up process did not speed up. Can you please give me back my gems and i will give u a 5 star. Thank you',
       'I have spent too much money on this. It\'s my own fault but they know what they are doing to make you want more. It\'s addictive. Don\'t get this game. Between the greed and the constant crashing on even a s8, it\'s just not worth your time or money. I have lost so many fight to other players because of the consistent crashes.',

       'This game really makes me mad. When you fight high levels, the monsters gang up, and go for strongest dragon, and this dragons are strong and have alot of health, and you need your strongest dragon to win. But other than that, it\'s a great game.',
       'Best game i  ever played in life. I have a request for the Feb daily bonus monster to be white walker. It\'s my dream monster. And if you cant do that, could you send me something on feb 28, because it will be my birthday!!',
       'What I think about this game is that it was really fun once I got my first device. My story was I was once playing the Xbox I finished all the games and I had nothing to do but one day my dad came for once in my life and gave me a tablet so the first thing I downloaded was this game then I got to a level that I was able to afford anything but I lost that tablet and restarted the whole game but it is still fun for me.' ],

     [ 'Overall... I\'d have to say it\'s a very basic game and I wish there was more to it. I have always loved the Simpson\'s and playing a game based on their life is surely interesting. However, I was hoping that it would be more realistic, fun and free. It turns out that it\'s a P2P game and that took my surprise because it really is unfortunate. I hope they improve the gameplay and graphics. More updates will definitely bring more players.',
       'I used to give this a 5 star rating but at level 150 I maxed out the amount of items I can have in my Springfield. Playing the game at this stage is pretty useless. I\'m not a hoarder, my Springfield is beautifully arranged so there is no way I will delete things in order to build new houses or place new items. Will come back when the cap is increased but for now I\'m sadly forced to take a break.',
       'I have been plying this game for years i love it and quite often play more than once a day. The graphics are great as are all the challenges i hopr you bring the gifts for visiting you friends towns back i hopr this game goes on for a long time most of my family play to x',
       'Since about 2 days ago the game keeps disconnecting from the server and I constantly need to \'retry\' to connect. Sometimes I am able to enter the game, but only for a short while before it crashes. Unable to stay connected.  No problem with wifi as this happens on multiple connections and it appears to be from the game\'s side.',
       'Crafted a straight trench & boom my crafty points disappeared The IRS radius shortened, clicking finished jobs doesnt redirect me to the Toon player. Train tracks cant be crafted anymore. The Claw machine gives Bowling shoes WTH. Maka Sprungfuld gret agan!',
       'Great game for Simpsons fans. But what kills the fun are constantly new side missions. Just as you finished one, two new shows up. You can never concentrate on what\'s most important and that\'s building the Springfield but rather playing with some ruffians at the time now.' ],

     [ 'It’s a battle for the ages! Wait, we mean a battle of the ages – kids and adults are at war in Springfield! But what could cause this generational divide – Unfair bedtimes? Too many vegetables? Territory rights to the town’s new playground? (That last one was so specific it has to be true). Can Bart lead the youths to victory over Homer’s aged army and claim Springfield’s new Mega Playscape?',
       'Gather your troops, fortify your structures, and see saw your seesaws. It’s time for war.' ],

     [ 'It\'s your standard "GOW" clone with a Godfather ripoff motif.  You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'They keep killing you to make more money. You can grow as much as you wish, whether you pay or not, these devs will just create more fake accounts to create revenue. Very unethical practices and immaturity is at the peak too. They have absolutely no professionalism. They openly admit that you can\'t beat them at their own game and will tell you in a very shameless way that the money is all they care about. Kids with ego keep buying stuff and they keep fuelling racial hate through their Chinese profanity all the time. Literally the worst game devs I\'ve ever seen. Would be 5 stars if this was not a fraud scheme of a game.',
       'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'This game would be amazing if they took away the 10 different flashing and bouncing icons from the main screen that are there just to try and sell you something. Global chat is a NIGHTMARE. Nothing but kids and teenagers talking about sex and asking for nude pics of each other on Instagram. If you can block all that out, more power to you, and enjoy what would probably be a pretty fun game otherwise. I tried it for a few days and am uninstalling it for the reasons I mentioned above.',
       'Nice game. I just thought that the Babe game part should be a bit more easier and less difficult coz its hard to score the chicks when your way up to level 11 and getting to the yatch. But the rest of the gameplay is fun and challenging. Overall... its a Good Fun Game. Awesome.' ],

     [ 'This is actually one of my favorite Final Fantasy titles. Graphics are gorgeous. The story is pretty deep and well written. The number of playable characters is astounding and most don\'t recycle moves. The devs update it regularly and are active in communicating with the community. A few things are kinda "broken", like the arena. And Microtransactions aren\'t overpowering, but they\'re there... 4/5',
       'Hi Gumi. I only started like last week of November. But I became an instant addict with this game. It has a lot of potential to be the best game on the mobile market. However, recent events and actions of the company stained the gameplay and soul of the players. It\'s like the events are not planned anymore, just putting something for us. And then this recent cash summon banner. This type of move is disrecpectful to us. I hope you can still turn it around. We will be waiting and I will still be playing to see what will happen. Thank you for this wonderful game.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since shortly after launch, and I love the gameplay and nostalgia it has to offer. However, the company has lately been predatory with low value bundles, which at first glance, might look like a good deal to a newer player. I would warn new players not to buy anything in-game until they get their act together.  Also, the game has been more buggy than usual lately, but I\'ll let that slide and hope it gets better.  In short, this is a 5 star game run by a 1 star company.',
       'This recent GUMI bundle offer really put a bad taste on the game for me. It really was not a favorable cash bundle for loyal customers in my opinion. I wish the banner was only 20 dollars or less or provided the loyal customer the choice of which 5* character they wanted guaranteed.  GUMI, please change this business practice and take care of the great community instead of continuing down this path of bringing the game down in customer loyalty and fun!!. The quality of the events, rewards, etc have dropped.',
       'After all the previous issues of bugs, hacking, etc, the game has really picked up its slack. The game is so muchs smoother now and seems like more effort has gone in to it. Drop rates still seem low, since the 3x boost I still receive basics, but that\'s not a huge issue as theres always a free giveaway every week. Overall the game is finally enjoyable without constant issues',
       'I like the game but the summon rates are just messed up. My friends sat down with me and watched, on multiple occasions, where I would do like ten or 11 summons all at once and Id get 10 or 11 of the same unit. Ive summoned enough gokens to get 2 of his tmrs, same with yuri and conrad. While these tmrs are good, I would like to have more than a pool of ten units to summon from, Im just sayin 🙄' ],
    recentChanges: 
     [ 'Fixes :',
       '- Fixed various display issues.',
       '- Fixed summon ticket counter alignment.',
       '- Fixed a crash issue in Siren’s Tower when taking more than 3 turns to clear wave 4.',

If you have a knowledge or love for the show then you will definitely want to see and hear the gameplay and special thoughts the developers put into making this South Park masterpiece!',
       'Online matchmaking is utterly broken and totally pay to win. Total mismatches being paired up against guys 5 levels higher with all higher card levels as well. Unless you\'ve got money to burn don\'t waste time grinding through ranks cause 45+ will best you down. Even if you do have the money to burn your still better off using it to keep warm as throwing it at this game will just give you the faintest satisfaction you\'ve accomplished something by simply having access to better cards then those you face.',

       'Simple spawn battle game. It has card elements which sucks be sure card collecting in a phone game is just a money grab. It\'s fun, but I\'m waiting for the point where I suddenly find the game unbeatable and buying a $35 pack of cards seems reasonable... cause yeah, they sell a single pack for that much.',
       'Like the others say: Too much pay to win Lots of poor sportsmanship, without ability to block I\'m always paired against higher level opponents.

     [ 'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'This game cheats! Don\'t get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn\'t for you. But if you don\'t care that much, like me, it\'s absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',
       'I\'ll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn\'t be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.',
       'Horrible game, stupid graphics looks like a preschooler did it, games are definitely rigged you hardly ever beat the house. To much stuff going on on this board you have no clue where to go to get to anything. The old game was easier to navigate. You should give people the option to keep the old game.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a great strategic game. PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it\'s a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team. Lots of ways to win free stuff and points you can spend on items needed in alliance store and keep up with your wallet warrior team mate. One downside is the support..they can be a little sliw in response time to problems. But they don\'t just ignore you either.',
       'Why does this app request access to make calls/read sms/messages? Un-installed right away.  Edit: That\'s not how it works. Just because you say "your phone is safe" doesn\'t make it safe. You\'re still getting the permission from un-educated users that you can read their messages. That\'s very shady.',
       'Why need to be legendary first to send rallies? In previous games that I played you don\'t need it to send rallies. Rallies are what makes an alliance one and it should be done even if you\'re not in legendary... Still love the game tho..',
       'Less false advertising would be better the game is not like what the video shows I found this on YouTube. May I make a suggestion..dont advertise it like runescape. I don\'t like playing games that false advertise. I am going to be making up a YouTube page where it is going to identify every game on advertising and how the game really is.',
       'Add more features to it. Add some dragon thingy or make it less "PAY FOR PLAY" game don\'t turn it as one of those games who being hated for being stupid for money. This game has a good future already. :) Have a good day',
       'I love this game,  but its money spender game yet what game isnt?  Their support help you in pretty good time most of the time it takes 24 hours but sometime sooner or little later, they add new cool fetures, they do fail to fix some minor things but for the most part it works perfect. One time we had enemy kingdom on our leader boards after KvK they fixed it in less then 1 hour that some great work if you ask me.' ],

Only problem with the game is that the option to increase match reward by 50% by watching a video crashes the game. It goes to a black screen with a white number 15 circled in the bottom left hand corner. Have to close out and relaunch. I get my reward but sucks having to do that.',

These two(2) ships just run and run because they know the shooter can\'t chase anyone of these two ships which makes the game really boring. Please think about this matter to balance the game.',
       'Fun when the match is fair and your team works together well. From what I heard, the system will make sure you maintain 50% win rate, basically that means some times you win the game with little efforts, others time you will be in team that cannot shoot and fixer that don\'t fix, imagine getting wiped out within 2 mins. Be prepared to lose more than 10 rounds straight in a row.',

All I ask is that you fix this glitch in the game where you complete an objective with the correct colored units and you still don\'t get awarded the pearls you\'re supposed to get for it.

My only complaints are that I wish you would earn boosters when you matched 4 in a row or in a square or something other than 5 in a row.

The game is addictive and challenging.  You upgrade each group of games that gradually get more difficult.  It\'s fun.

Since playing the game more I\'ve decided that there\'s not enough gas for me to be able to enjoy the game like I want to. I think the car should either hold more, or gas should be easier to get. This is just a game that already has inconsistencies with reality. Otherwise I love the game',

Build a camp, in order to multiply resources, because you will need them to improve other buildings. Also, to note, this game will not allow you to get stronger unless you improve your camp. I have survivors who cannot level up until I Improve the council. The training grounds will not be built any further unless you improve the council. Its like a city/fort building game with tactical rpg feel to it.  There is a leaderboard, that actually awards you for being at a certain tier. You can join guilds to help get better gear. I love this game!  ...The con that I have with this is that every time of logging on, deals are thrown in my face, and it is enticing too.',

Though, I\'ve noticed that when I try to do certain things, like finish a mission or shoot a walker outside the fences the game would freeze for 5-20 seconds which would take away from the game play.

Don\'t need real money to be pro. Anyway I can get 30 crystals per day from crates. I know you can even more.  3. Games is great I recommend',
       'It is a good game, lots to do unfortunately it takes way to long to upgrade, cost is to high. Need more worker droids and can\'t afford them. Looks like you have to put in real money in order to be able to afford anything. No log in bones stronger players always pounding weaker players. Other than that it looks good, sounds good easy to figure out how to play.',
       'This is my favorite game on Google play, and I\'ve played MANY others.   Also, I recently had an issue recovering my base on a new device. At first, it didn\'t seem like I was going to get it back, but support was able to eventually help me recover my base, and for that, I\'m grateful.  Beware: This game is highly addictive. =)',
       'This game works great if you only have a few minutes of time to play. Not a game to play in large amounts of time. There are delays as you build or add to your arsenal. I usually spend a little bit of time on the game and let it run while I work. Then check back periodically. You could sit and battle all day long, but I like the option to being able to still play yet get my daily tasks done.',
       'Very addictive. Fun. Pay attention, A lot to take in, but fun. Never dull. Unless your a little baby and can\'t handle strategic gaming. The only downside in my opinion. It takes to long for certain things to level up. Other than that great game!',
       'Pros: Very addictive, crisp and clear graphics, and the best take I\'ve seen on a Star Wars based strategy game. Cons: Game balance is very poor, pay to play pretty much. Always having your base attacked and nothing you have set up stops it, but when you attack someone else\'s base and they have the same equipment you lose every time.' ],

     [ 'I know the update on The Book of Dragons came out a long time ago, but I still can\'t make sense of it. The old book of Dragons was a lot easier to understand. If you filtered it to show only searchable dragons, then it would show in order what you unlock. I\'m not sure, but from what I understand is that the dragons are now arranged in time to search. That\'s neat and all, but could you please come out with a filter for dragon unlocsks by Lvl?  Dragons unlocked at a later Lvl is usually better. With the current filter, you can find a dragon which collect 14 mill wood/hour with dragons collecting 1.05 mill wood because it is arranged by time to search. Again, please release a filter option by Lvl unlocked? Thanks for your help!',
       'I really prefer  the old version of  this game like how you\'d have a dragon and you\'d guard a wagon and collect gold and fish and some time a new egg. And if a dragon attacked you\'d battle it and have to tilt your tablet to fly aim you fire blasts.could you add a dragon racing minigame',
       'Game is a good time killer, but getting anywhere in the Jerk at Work is almost impossible. 3 waves of enemies above my level and the only way I can even the odds is if I pay for sage fruit. That is far too stupid and dumb. Thanks for being impossible to beat. UGH',
       'The new update is really great!  But there\'s one glitch when unlocking the legendary dragons. The part in collecting resources for 15 days. It stopped counting the hours since I updated. (It was already 9 days and counting...)   Please fix this.',
       'Slow loading and sometimes does not even load the villege. I already tried clearing cache and it started to re download(tried freeing up space - didn\'t work). Very frustrating and suck. But this is a good game. Please fix and update the game.',
       'The new update is nice, except for the iron storage downgrade. Why the hell would you downgrade from 45k to 10k??? Rest of iron in mail, all 30000 of it!!! Why, thank you , it\'s good to know that I will be able to keep 5000 iron AND LOSE 25K WHEN I CLAIM THE PACK IN MY MAIL. Now I have to keep the mail iron and collect more over days on end to make the next iron storage upgrade.... seriously??? At least divide the iron into packs of say 3k each so that it\'s usable. The fact that the iron storage was downgraded is bad enough, but 30k iron in email when storage is reduced to 10k sucks!!!!  Update: claimed the extra iron. It ended up split into packs of 5000 iron in mail. Little happier now' ],

     [ 'I love that you don\'t lose troops while defending. The only problem is the cost to heal them is rediculous. There are many aggressive players that assault you early on in the game and unless you pay money it becomes difficult to maintain a stable civilization. I believe it would be better if there were cheaper or easier ways to gain resources for those whom don\'t pay to win. Thank you for the amazing game though! Love you guys and I will never quit playing!',
       'I watched commercials about this on YouTube and after downloading the game I was very disappointed about the graphics. It\'s more like a crudely drawn cartoon. It seems OK, but there\'s not a whole lot of variations from other games in this category. Wish the developers of these games would add a new feature or two just to make it stand out. I\'m going to keep playing but if it doesn\'t get better after a while I\'ll probably unistall.',
       'I like the game. Has a few things that are a pain though. Like you cant share resources if they were bought, what does that even matter. I also dont like that your avatar can only be your facebook pic or an in game one..give me the option to upload my own pic without changing my facebook one.',

     [ 'Love this game...best WWE Game on mobile, and I\'ve played them all. So addicting I spend money on it. I do wish it was easier to get TP, and tokens to level up superstars. I\'ve been playing for almost a year, and have EASILY spent 6 or 700 on this game, and only have 1 three star superstar....only because i bought TP  and Arn Anderson crate over Christmas!! For some reason, I\'m still addicted.',
       'Real talk. The game is a blast but if you are going into it thinking its free to play you will be in the pit of misery for a long time. It takes money to get up to par really quick and its always fun to watch the cpu combo you to death when you have 0 control over it. But take the bs with the good and its a fun game but dont think for free is for me on this one. Gotta pay to play.',
       'Much better update. Battery life is actually decent. No freezes yet. I like the new system to make more coin. Still a grind, but I don\'t mind. I spend some money here and there. Suggestions: bring women\'s division. Unlock finishers, seriously, Bray Wyatt doesn\'t use a Stone Cold Stunner. Please add new music. Thanks!',
       'I believe I started playing this game of April of last year. I upgraded my phone and the company can not retrieve my old account. I paid money to play this game. I attempted to retrieve my old account in which they requested a transaction ID which I sent them in a text and picture format. They are unable to find my account so the money I spent is gone. Please do not spend money if you want to play this game. There are dozens of gem games out there that will fill that void. I know it is a Wwe licensed product but please be aware that you may lose money because of their terrible account migration system.',
       'Love the game except now it\'s not going past the loading screen and can\'t get on to play has been like it since last update... have waited giving the benefit of the doubt that a new update may come and fix whatever bug has caused the issue but still no joy... please fix galaxy s8 new update still not working',
       'The concept is great, game is great but i think  devlopers sucks a big time. Its all about greed, thay are after your money only. Odd are very poor, after a point of time you realised that you hv left no interest . So many glitches and its all about spending real money for decent progress. I wish they realised that long term strategy is good instead of making some dollars by pushing for purchase.   I wish somebody else will takeover this game.' ],

Gameplay is terrible and the story line is basically non existent. On the bright side, you do not have to spend money on this game to level quickly.  I will keep this game until the next update and if the bugs are not fixed I will uninstall.',

Collecting rss is by far the fastest than any game I\'ve played, collecting troop training buffs is by far the best, I\'ve never seen so many probably $500 or more dollars have been collected in training buffs. This game deserves to be the number one game ever! Keep up the awesome work blood tyrant!',

     [ 'Man, this is a perfect 5/7! Out of a crapton of Mu Origin game clones, this is even better than original! Polished graphics, nice player skills set, awesome UI items layout - everything is top notch! The only thing I can wish for is adding camera turn on top of player strafe via joystick. Thanks for the hard work, and please keep it up!',
       'Finally a mobile mmo that actually feels like a real mmorpg. Nice graphics, skills, open world questing, lots of players. Fights are engaging  and boss fights are spectacular and interactive. You do need a team for dungeons and raids as you can\'t just 1 shot everything, like in other mobile mmos. I\'ve tried loads but this is the best by far! Keep it up!',
       'Great mobile MMO! Good graphics and narration so the story stays interesting. Additionally...SO much Co-op and PvP and a lot of things to give an edge. Not P2P dominated either so far. Obviously the grind to 55 is tough but I have a few characters on different servers there still very possible.',
       'Love this games good graphic and updated.  But love warrior in any game but in this game warrior are weak in dps. Can u adjust skill  And i spend real money on top up every week but no legend reforge from bp.  How sad to my char. Legend are to far away to me full set legend. I play evryday not to miss anything on event',
       'Terrible customer service!!!!!!!!!! They will dodge your questions and problems you have reported and make up things untill you are so mad you dont even want to deal with them. One star till they fix the glitches i reported. And i will never spend a dime on this game!!! How could you trust your money to people that dodge your questions  and give you answers that dont have anything to do with what the conversation is even about. Super shady customer service!!! Watch out people!!! Game crashes every 15 to 30 minutes since last update!! Been going on for 6 months now and still no fix. Lets fix the countless glitches and crashes before adding new content with more problems. Complete fail!!!!!!!',
       'Its a great game. But i think its abit hard to make gold in the game specialy when you are a new player and dont realy know whats happening. Things are also expensive to buy. There should realy be away to trade in the game or send stuff by mail or so. Or the things should not be so expensive to buy.' ],

       'This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That\'s why I rated this game 5 stars.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'This game is great! Even though you have to constantly farm for wins, but it does pay off. I\'m a level 12 in Ruby rank with 👌 guns. I used to have a candy cane baton that killed instantly upon impact, but it\'s not as effective against gold armor. R. I. P. Strategy',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play 😄' ],

     [ 'This is a very well put together battle strategy game. Good graphics, character setup, team building and even the balance is better than average, but the whole feel of the game is pay to win. Which is a bummer because it is such a good game. If you don\'t spend cash it will take years to catch up, but you never will. I don\'t think the developers should give everything away or stop giving an edge to individuals that want to put money into the game, but the progression is painstakingly slow. It\'s fun to play, but loses that feeling of success from a good win when the next 5 opponents just destroy you, Vader emoji, because they can afford it. I will continue to play, because it is fun, but it\'s no longer a daily go to.',
       'This Game is great on every level. all of our favourite heroes and Villains are here. The Gamelay is fun and strategic. The Graphics are great. But Some Leaders come across as a little Overpowered. For the next Update I would suggest adding Kit Fisto ( unique Nadar Vebb ) and Asajj Ventress ( Unique 2 nightsister archers.)',
       'The gameplay is good and the graphics are amazing.  The biggest problem I have with this game is the matchmaking.  It\'s based off a tier  system, which makes some sense, but other players somehow in the same tier as you can have Much more powerful cards to the point where 2 foot units can take out your tank.  Balance system should take card levels into account to create a deck strength rating instead.   Makes WAY more sense.',
       'Initially this game is very fun. The issue is after you\'ve played it a bunch you realize one faction is objectively better than the other. I have downloaded this game twice after I read they changed some balancing issues. This is my second time uninstalling. The first time and Empire was just way too strong because I had the better seige weapon. Now Rebels have the better seige weapon and they\'re entirely too strong. The gameplay is well done, the balancing is frustrating.  With only two factions it\'s a little hard to balance and you can tell with the game like this.',
       'This is the best Star Wars mobile experience so far. The mix of action graphics and strategy are a real treat, and the so far the developers seem focused on making a balanced game with lots of viable characters to choose from. Even as a free-to-play player without a guild, the game is still very engaging.',
       'Game was great up til the last update, no idea what they did but it\'s unbalanced now. It\'s become a blob game (just toss as much on the map and push)  Update to response: it\'s a blob game, fun but still a blob game. Certain units are op and unbalanced. AT RT walker anyone? 3 seconds and a turret is down. Still fun, just needs balancing.' ],

I don\'t know how to explain it but the main heroine doesn\'t have similar features like other 1492 studio\'s heroins have, a resemblence of face features. Maybe you should work on the face features to make it look like other heroins of "is it love" games because it looks completely different. Kind of unsettling to me.',

     [ 'Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to "rent" which is an option in the game.',
       'Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and "WIN" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.',
       'Awesome graphics, and for what you get on a phone, it really is an amazing game. The only complaint (if you can even call it that) I have is the controls can be a little tricky as sometimes when you\'re trying to swing left or right you can accidentally change your weapon instead of swing to either side. Aside from that, tremendous gameplay, multiple modes to play, amazing graphics, really just an awesome game. Make sure you have a really good internet connection.',
       'Be prepared the stupidity. 230 armor 120 health isnt enough to protect against the remington. So if u want to survive be prepared to pay more and more always. This game aint fun after a while. More annoying really. Otherwise would recommend it. So look elsewhere if u dont want to pay a hell of a lots of money' ],

     [ 'Hate the new update. What\'s with you and all these chibi things? You\'ve done it before and based on the review, your players love the Mature and Realistic style much better. So why you changed back again? You have totally Lost your Identity and Uniqueness as LoA game.  If you planned on doing this, why don\'t you do it in the first place? so we don\'t have to waste our time and money!',
       'What\'s with the chibi hero icons? 😭 The artwork was so good and everything works smoothly before the update. Also, during battle, it\'s lagging. In my  opinion, the previous one is way better than current. I\'ve been a fan of different LoA versions, please don\'t ruin this one. 😟',
       'I *HATE* the new style. The reason why I liked this game in the first place was because there were no chibi characters. Dominion has no instructions and seems rather useless - but could be developed into something cool. The team formation doesn\'t have a way to sort your characters (I wish it was ordered by BR). I can get used to the new layout but for right now adjusting is hard. Thanks for developing the game more but please go back to the original character designs.',
       'Update on 2/23 made the game worse. Originally i gave this game a 5 star but with this update it feels more like a 3 star if not 2 star game. I get that you have to update games to keep it fun but sometimes you shouldn\'t change something just for the sake of change. Why not add content instead of trying to fix something that isn\'t broken.',
       'I started playing this game few days ago and I liked it so much. The graphics, controls, story all we\'re very interesting and addictive. Until the developers decided to update this game and completely ruin it and making it just like other mainstream RPG genere with ordinary graphics.   They just completely removed the story of the game and now every stage looks like I\'m playing some Angry Bird infact even that game has some story to every level.   In conclusion, this game was more fun before the update but now it\'s like ordinary RPG.',
       'Originally sold on the realism of artwork, then slapped in the face with ugly-by-comparison cartoon representations after last update. If they want a game with this style, go make one. Don\'t suddenly apply it into a game people are already invested in and were sold on realism in character visuals. Every preview image for the download page is now practically a lie. Might come back, despite the complete lack of foresight and consideration to the players, should they properly change the artwork back. Otherwise I\'ll be uninstalling and thinking twice before ever touching another GTarcade related game.' ],

       'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

Otherwise love the game',
       'This game is a great game if you are in to quick action and thinking. It makes you panic and you may get you quite frustrated. In this cooking dash you can upgrade your cooking materials and move to newer places. You can add more helpers as you play and level up. For my opinion I say this game is a great choice, on the other hand getting money can be hard. Especially when you keep your customers waiting. When they wait to long you lose more money, you may not care but you will have a target and if you don\'t reach it you can\'t move up a level. The game is free to download. This is a quick active cooking game, I highly recommend you to download this game.',

The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?',
       'At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don\'t have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha',

       'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',

     [ 'Really like this game. It\'s like the love child of Civilization and Clash of Clans. Love the fact there\'s a different designs for units and buildings when using different nations. Lots of strategy and depth when it comes to battle. Also, includes events based on history. The only thing on my wishlist for this game is that they add a nation unaffiliated with any country and does not have special units so players can play through the default units and buildings through the ages like Yuri in C&C.',
       'The Best Strategy Game I\'ve ever played. Its because It has Unique way to play than other games.Every Level u go U will find out fun & adventures. I got addicted to this game. Speacilly I like the gameplay of this game because Its seems so real.Like,Survived soilder will return to your base,troops vs troops fight, no magic spell,Human made Weapon used in this game which is possible & I love unlocking new ages here. Supper Cool Game',
       'Best empire game I\'ve had. And I\'ve downloaded probably all of them. Great aesthetic changes when upgrading buildings. The fact you can actually strategically place troops and attack is awesome. Love that resources respawn and that there\'s animations when farming them. The different nations with their advantages is a lovely touch.  The one draw back I would say is that it\'s expensive in a new players city to fulfil the task to join an alliance. Not a huge issue. Just would be nice to join friends sooner.  All in all amazing game. Great work Dev team',
       'Fun game, although there is pretty strong pressure to purchase upgrades to complete missions after an hour or so of gameplay. Two stars because the "crown" reward. System does not work. As it should. Several tasks were completed for rewards and the reward never showed up. In fact, the reward mysteriously disappeared from my queue. Feels fishy to me...',
       'Really great game like clash of clans, but mixed with the old age of empires or empire earth. Only problem I\'ve encountered is when I go to upgrade a building, no matter what level I upgrade it to, the preview picture looks like a level 1 version of the building. Other than this, the game is fun and constantly updated. I miss how easy it was to get trade goods.',
       'Used to like this game a lot. The missile silo ruined it. Now my troops are regularly wiped out and I wait two hours to play again. Not fun. And the waiting times for anything to finish are absurd. Developers take note: you screwed up. You should keep the faster training times of the Carnival event permanently. I\'m pretty close to giving up on this game, and I\'ve been playing for three years' ],

     [ 'Love the game! Cute characters. You get to see progress through upgrades to the island. Reason for middle score..... Game is attractive to my young children because of characters. Did not appreciate the ad for Whiz Kalifas Weed Farm app. I understand the need for ads for f2p, but maybe better choices.',
       'Absolutely love this game! What a great job! Everything about this game is amazing! Love the graphics, colors, story line, game play... everything! Some levels are more difficult, but not so hard that you can\'t complete them with the boosters or after a couple of tries. Plenty of free stuff and opportunities for additional boosters. The tournaments add another level of play. I like to wait to rate a game, but I just reached level 100 and I\'m still having a great time. Thank you for such a great diversion from my everyday stress!',
       'While I do really like this game I have an issue with the daily challenge. When your supposed to spin the wheel 10 times in one day and it\'s the hard challenge, I could see having it come up less often. What I cannot see, however, is making the challenge impossible by not allowing a spin at all after I made my seventh spin.',
       'Been playing for 4 months.  It\'s the funnest and most clever match 3 game I\'ve played.  I play all 3 levels for each task.  Hard work and patience pay off.  I\'m starting task 191 and the game keeps freezing and thus, freezes my tablet.  It helped to un-install and re-download a few times but now it is chronically persistent.  I hope next month\'s update will correct this.',
       'let me see,I  can\'t play it kicks me out I don\'t know why developers always make a game and says all these neat things about there great game when appearently did not look at wether it could be played on all devices old or new so I have to delete another great beautiful fun game!!!!  I\'m tired of this 😜😻',

     [ 'It\'s okay. The graphics are endearing. Controls and gameplay are smooth and easy to understand. A freemium game to be sure. It openly offers over-priced items like they are a great deal (they aren\'t). Most of it\'s purchase items are more expensive than other games. It has a gem subscription but for only 10 days, most simular games offer it for the full month for the same price, while offering more gems.',
       'OMG THIS IS AWESOME PEOPLE DON\'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING THE GRAPHICS AND CONTROLS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT!!!!!! Except for the part when you raid somebody and the opponent\'s team always kills you before you kill them. ANYWAYS IT\'S STILL THE BEST keep the updates coming IT IS SO FUN DESPITE NOBODY I KNOW EXCEPT FOR MY FAMILY EVEN KNOWS IT EXISTS GREATEST GAME EVEEEERRRRRR!!!',
       'Multitude of heroes to make your team. Not stingy about giving the player stuff. Potential fun for all, as casual game. Has PvP elements. Energy bar system replenishes when level up and even progresses in size as you advance. Should not be an issue until you get farther in, random energy gains also occur on maps with a little luck. Short tutorial at game beginning is torture to endure but is over in under 5 min. Great free game!',
       'Love the game so far. You could say I\'m a try hard because I\'ve only been playing the game for a month and a week and I\'m already level 52. With 100% win rate and 83% defense rate  have one of the best teams in the game. And like I said before love it so far but for the next update. You\'ll should add friendly battles. Such as battling with your friends, clan mates, random players. Etc.',
       'Best game ever for phones. However, recently there is some issues with the treasure chests in the dungeons. When you can choose between three chests that are either Good, Great or Amazing. Now I have clicked over 10 times on these and every single time it has been only Good - chest. This can not be just a coincidence, there must be an issue with the system. Can you please fix this? Because it\'s really bothering me. Best',
       'Pretty fun game but I had an issue happy pretty quickly into the game and I\'m hoping devs see this and help out.  I bought ten common portals for the 100k gold, after opening the first one the game decided to crash and I am no longer able to redeem my 9 other chest. I change to 5 star if we can this resolved.

     [ 'My favorite game I have ever played on mobile.  Thought I wasn\'t going to like it the first day until I read a review that said it was better than the regular game. Went back and played it. Now I have logged in every single day since launch day last year. I actually love it so much I play with two separate accounts on two different phones. Now that\'s most definitely something I will probably never ever do with another game ever made. That should say it all right there. Best role-playing game on mobile. Best game on mobile I have ever played and I\'ve played hundreds. Nuff said.',
       'It\'s been a month now and the bug still hasn\'t been fixed. LET ME HOST IN THE ARENA!!!! I can only join matches from my fellowship but whenever i try to host my own to get more trophies it would never lead me to the part which level i want to do. I just get stuck on the "connecting to matchmaking" loop. Please',
       'The new arena future is great. But there is lots of room for improvement. If they start linking it with money then all effort down the drain.  Edit- Now I am starting to dislike the game. Event Rewards are no more good. If you pump lots of money then only you get good characters. Arena feature doesn\'t allow us to select players in public matches .',
       'Good game though if you want new characters expect to pay for them! Get about 10 free then from their either pay £90 or dont progress any futher. Would rather spend that on my ps4. Apart from that gd style off game, shame im starting get annoyed that cant progress or gain new characters. Hopefully devs will sort it out before i give up on it?',
       'Decent game. But the back to back events keep us from kicking players from the fellowship. Its extremely annoying. I\'ve submitted a ticket but it didn\'t solve anything. Fix this issue immediately.',
       'Overall a cracking game to waste time, good story and gameplay mechanics for a mobile game are top notch. Only faults are it takes so long to earn enough mirian (money for upgrades) and gems for new characters but overall a fantastic mobile game, maybe even the best I\'ve ever played.' ],

     [ 'Hi! I\'m having some issues here as the game wasnt loading well the whole day thus I have re-installed it. My level is back to my previous gae; however to my shock, all my hard-earn power-ups are 0 now. Is there anything you can do to retrive them back??TT Thank you~~ I really enjoyed this game.',
       'This game is great! The characters make the game play more fun than just matching items. And when I get close to not beating a level their lips quiver and worry and make me laugh. So if you are a lighthearted fun person you will love this cute game.',
       'Best match game! This matching game is the best from all of the different matching games I\'ve tried. It\'s so colorful and refreshing! The characters are adorable and I love the art style. It\'s also really fun when you\'re about to fail a level and the characters get teary-eyed. 😅',
       'A lot like candy crush with some interesting twists. Every switch from puzzle screen to menu screen brings up a loading page that takes a really long time. Over all though a good app for kids.',
       'Just keeps getting worse!  Great update! I have to close it after 3 games because the screen flashes!  You get x3 and they give you 1. All the "review highlights " are from an older version!  May have been ok back then, but jam city has added scam to it. Unable to remove last cracker with balloon, yet they take one of them from me. Watch a stupid ad and the screen goes black or flashes.  Restart and that life has been lost.  Or, watch an ad and you don\'t get the booster.  Some levels are faded and cant be played.  Shut it down and that life has been lost.  81 did it 3 times.  These people have no integrity.',
       'I\'m on android playing. Lots of friends. Lots of lives. Only problem that I keep reporting is when I click on free booster I get an ad \'slots era\' that freezes my game. JuiceJam won\'t have ad fixed so I am hardly playing.' ],

     [ 'The game is great. Real old-school shmup. Graphics are ok, sometimes though so much is happening on screen that you can\'t see enemy bullets. Game needs control sensitivity options (like most of the other shmups). Overall - fun all the way!',
       'Great game.  Keeps me coming back.  A lot of depth for a top-down shooter.  I also love that it isn\'t pay to win, and there aren\'t any forced ads.  One of the very few phone games I actually enjoy playing, rather than just using them to kill time.',
       'I\'m VIP 2, currently on Stage 100, like this game but I have a suggestion. Please add Aircraft choosing option when prompted to join others online, 30 secs to prepare but got nothing to do except buying Powerups? That\'s too much time on hand and wasted. Some plane works well on normal stages while some works especially good against bosses, minus one star because the lack of this option. I\'ll consider giving you 5* if my plead is granted.',
       '(Tips for newcomers at the end) Classic style shmup, much less bullet-hll than most others out there. Been playing for over 6 months now. Not too many menus which I hate in a game, and the fun is quick to find and indulge in, solo or with a partner chosen from a friends list or a random volunteer in the world. It has microtransaction mechanics, but there\'s numerous ways to earn the special currency (gems) through normal playing. Earning base currency (gold) is hilariously generous, too. TIPS FOR NEWCOMERS; you\'ll be tempted to unlock every plane as soon as available, and get them all to the highest level right away. Don\'t. Stick with the same plane from early on (my fave was Laserbite), use gold to level it, and only use gems to upgrade for next rank milestones. You can test drive all the planes you unlocked to buy through story mode; the last one gets unlocked by stage 130 (sounds like a lot, but if you\'re the dedicated type, it\'ll take a month at most). And for Verdia\'s sake, don\'t use gems for respawn. Easy or medium, you can use a second plane to continue. For hard, just quit and try again with a different world partner, you\'ll usually make it within 3 or 4 tries. Gems are for the test-driven plane you liked most, and opening the next rank milestones for planes and BroBots. For BroBots, you can unlock most through BroPoints (generously given as well) and test drive those by equipping them and redoing old levels. The harder ones to unlock, you can observe world partners using most of them and decide if what you see seems useful to your style. Good luck and happy hunting!',
       'Great game. I\'d give it 5 stars, but after the update it erased my premium for 30 days midway. Very frustrating.',
       'Could\'ve been so much better. There\'s literally no way to gain the highest end aircrafts without either grinding for ages, or buying crystals with real money. What i particularly hated is that the "craft" method is completely missing for the aircrafts. You can craft bots using blueprints, but you can\'t craft aircrafts using blueprints. That\'s the last straw that drove me away from the game. Had that been an option, this was a total 5 star. But the greed really drove it away. And mind you i have actually spent some money on this game already, but am still dissatisfied.' ],

If you plan to be f2p or even semi p2w you might be able to compete with the top if you spend years buying and waiting for Alices\' bond.',

He was the one hero that could stop the lvl 100 millionaire players and igg nerfed him hard.   The one thing free to play players can do for definite progress is invest energy into the mine for spirit arbiter and mythrill drone combined with Oracle\'s melded. And even that basic setup requires a minimum of around 25 million coins and at least 5 months of grind',

       'Read players reviews this game is made to b insanely hard and the matching for tournament n sky arena means u cannot win when it opens for u. Very broken . On the plus side lots of cards  n lots to do but there are parts of the game u won\'t b able 2 do the main map gets very hard n u will face impossible opponents after the first few.',

     [ 'The best TD game I\'ve found over my years of searching for them on Android. I\'ve owned this one for a couple years and they still continue to update and support the game. The in-app purchases are optional unless you want to play competitively, then about $5 of them are required and you can unlock everything else for free. I don\'t play competitively so I\'ve only bought a $2 IAP and that it.',
       'After putting many hours into this i will say i love. The only downsidr is there is a pay to win aspect.   I was playing a normal vs match and for some reason both me and my partner were gaining $$ extremly fast. To the point that you coukd build a massive defence really early. 5x maxed out super monkey gods with 5 money making farms maxed at level 20 into the match...... i thought it was hacking. Nope, for $10 you can get 2x cash.... pretty much the only way to do the higher levels, or spend forever grung enough $$ with special towers.   Fun game, i got to deep, trying to get out.',
       'When Are You Going The Release Another BTD? Been at least 5 years now. since you released this on PC. Been playing for years. Would be nice for there to be extra things todo other then just masteries and special buildings. Fantastic game especially with the coop feature too.  Would enjoy more. challenging maps, balloons and restrictions to maps. as well as new agents and towers.  Be looking forwards to see what you have in store for the future. (P.S. Sas needs that too)',
       'Pretty decent game. I\'m wondering if the Bloonvasion event ever actually changes, because I\'ve owned this game for over a month now and no matter how many times it tells me there\'s a new one it\'s always the same level. Is that ever going to change?',
       'The co-op games suck... 80% of the games drop out... this is not an exaggeration 2x bonus as a daily reward ( for three days) gives nothing... Still s good game for nothing.. Playing now for over 12 months still no end in sight',
       'Love this game. But. If you plan on beating the ipopable mode save your time. I have spent thousands in monkey cash, followed all online strats down to the tower and still cant beat the first level. Impossible to beat and frustrating enough to uninstal.' ],

     [ 'It\'s fun to play but it\'s like any other build game. But this one you level your building and otherthings to level 4. Then after that you need diamonds to level up. You need to buy them because they only give you one a day!! And you need 80 or more to level up things. So spend that money you dont have!! This game is a HUGE MONEY PIT!! You have been warned!!!',
       'I played this game for 18 months. Was very far in the game. Then they wanted me to do an upgrade. Afterwards I could not get back into the game at all. So I uninstalled and reinstalled it. I ended up having to start all over again. Most games will let you pick back up where you left off in case you get a new phone. This game does not. Other than that is a game of patience unless you have 1000.00 to put into it to advance quickly. It is relaxing to play for the most part. Kids might like it. It teaches how to be wise with money.',
       'Update: have played nearly a year and a half now. Game is fun, graphics good, addicting. You can play without spending one cent, and still have fun.  Good game for killing time or if you really want to invest... many levels and special events await. And the game actually doesn\'t have many glitches in it to be a bother. Liking on Facebook, one can actually hear from the game people about problems. That\'s a big plus.   Comment from 6/2016: Level too high for me to rate it any better. Can\'t rate what I can\'t see. You might wait to make rating it a mission until the level required to play it has been reached',
       'Seem to have issues and when I report them and send screenshots, your answer to all the issues is " clear your cashe and reboot".  Not impressed.  Upset is what I am.  I am not irrelevant.  And what I present to your tech support shouldn\'t be disregarded.',
       'I really love this game!!!! I cnt wait for you to make number 3 cause I love this game. Been playing it since it 1st came out. I would like to buy it as well. I would to know why it\'s so hard to log in on fb and sign in as well wen ur already logged in. Please fix please fix.',
       'Other than the "cannot connect to server" being a recurrent glitch when challenges are having bonus days or you are stupid enough to spend real money on timed competition  boosters...... Oh and the 10 hrs for ballyscape diving happens overnight here so I never get a chance beyond the first dive....  Good gameplay and lots to do instead of just collect and reset' ],

     [ 'Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'Update......I have learned there is a chat feature AND a neighborhood group you can create.....so excited to get to level 19!!!! Would give it a solid 5 stars if we could have an actual chat option with friends. Looking for a new game to get away from FV2, but can\'t find one with the same chat availability.  Add this and I am hooked!',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.' ],

     [ 'I have been playing this for over a year and got to level 600s. All of a sudden no free gifts to help beat a level which are almost impossible to beat. Now is when you need the freebies! And tickets? What good are They? I think it\'s time for an uninstall since the level I\'m on now I\'ve been trying for days to beat! Impossible and no longer fun. Should be fun not stressful.',
       'I have re rated this as I had to reset my tablet. I then logged back into the game only to have to start all over again as I don\'t do Facebook. This game needs its own log in. Also every time I complete a level I get adds. What ever has happened it is spoiling the fun of the game.',
       'Lost my gifts from completing the task for tier 6 level.  And they disappeared. Please fix or I\'m uninstalling. I worked to hard to complete and not be rewarded. It was for collecting butterflies.  Tooooooo many glitches. Please fix if ya want better ratings. Sick of the bullcrap time to uninstall and save some data',
       'Love this game! Stupid toto barking on the menu drives me nuts though! Lots of challenges for bonus items and the game keeps evolving. Sometimes little glitches when using lollipops, but mostly free of problems like freezing etc. Hopefully I can keep enjoying the game as long as I have enjoyed the film.',
       'Ok, I\'ve been playing this game for awhile not as much anymore.  Not getting moves like I used too get for my daily prize, Judy non sense like tickets. What do I need the tickets for?  Can I buy stuff with them?  What? I have no idea what the tickets are for.  Pleaser put the moves back, at least I can use them.',
       'I have been trying for a while to pass the level I\'m on.  I send help to friends they had unlimited lives and still didn\'t pass it.  Come on I like a challenge  but this is ridiculous.   I like playing but if I have to spend all my lives and not level up I will just play candy crush....because your getting just like that game...' ],

     [ 'Great game. Loving it. I noticed when you go into the Alter, there is a note telling you your capacity limit at the bottom but in the Mana gem screen it doesn\'t tell you. Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',
       'What started out a 5 star wonderful game has dropped to a prime example of how Not to treat loyal players and followers. With the latest update to "rebalance" which stripped long time players of attack powers, levels and hit points the developers should take notice of how many people no longer spend valuable time on their offerings. This is sadly another one for the uninstall button because after months of grinding to improve my character to now basically start over isnt worth it',
       'It was bad enough what the update did to players characters.......but after your patch to supposedly take into account players objections about how their characters statistics were lowered,  my character lost another power level and 2 million in power after the patch. Absolutely pathetic how you have treated the players who have played this game. Perhaps I should contact some of my friends that are Bratva to represent me and voice my complaints. Have a nice day!',
       'Result of your update, invisible walls,  player getting stuck running like a idiot, you created a algorithm for a headless chicken, good thing I advised my friends NOT to download it, if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it, g___dy b___s__t artist. I bet all the good reviews you got were done in your offices, shed or bedrooms, back to ye olde ps4.',
       'I am uninstalling this game unless you give me back my power and previous level before the update. You reduced my power, but all levels are at the same difficulty level. That is not adjusting difficulty, that is infuriating.' ],

They\'re not annoying like some games that repeat the same darn words throughout the game. Uuuuuugh! So annoying.  Thank you developers for not destroying the fun in this game by putting repeating vocals. The music is calming, the graphics are awesome! I don\'t have the funds to purchase power-ups, etc., but it\'s still fun! This 51yr. old lady thanks you bunches! 🙆‍♀️👍',

     [ 'This is a pretty good app,  but when building it needs an option to replace a room with another type. You shouldn\'t have to spend all your caps to rework a floor plan, especially when you built everything not knowing you could combine rooms since the help pop ups didn\'t mention that until after you had been building a while.  Other than that it is thoroughly acceptable.',
       'I love this game so much! It\'s very addicting and challenging. I love the animation I am all for it. I think though that one thing that would help is a pregnancy bar of some sort to tell you how long your person is pregnant for. That\'s something that I would add and maybe some times you get a huge wave of people and then you lose resources and such faster I think that may make it more challenging, but overall I love this game!',
       'I love this game, it\'s really fun. The only thing I wished was that when the characters level up, it actually does something more than raise their health. Like, increase stats in the place their working, or increase production. Maybe not every level, but there should be more benefits to leveling up. When bringing wastelanders back, let\'s say they are gone for an hour and you start to bring them back, when you get to ten minutes before they get home and put them back to exploration, they shouldn\'t jump back to where they started, from an hour. Idk. But I love the game.',
       'This game is so very exciting to play. As an avid fan of nearly all Bethesda games, this is a great mobile representation of their Fallout Universe. The gameplay is enticing and there is always something new around every quest; however it should be noted every quest storyline has variance, the quest gameplay is similiar between all. Comparing your dwellers from the beginning to a week into the game and there is a sense of accomplishment. The customisation of the dwellers and vault rooms is satisfying. The only thing I would add that isn\'t already presented, would be multiplayer. A way to send dwellers or explore eachothers vaults. If this option exists, and I just don\'t see it, I apologize.  Great game. Love to play.',
       'I really enjoyed this game but upgraded phone from s5 to note 8 and can\'t get my old game save back. Tried to follow steps and load from cloud but nothing loads. Wouldn\'t really care about starting over so much if I hadn\'t spent money on the game. Hopefully developer helps me out. I can screen shot order history to verify in game purchases if need be.',
       'Fallout shelter is a fun, beautiful quick game you can keep coming back to. For me fallout shelter is one of my most favorite games on mobile and keep coming back to even after over a year of playing it. They keep updating it to. There are plenty of things to collect as well as people u might know from the other fallout games. Really really fun and love the cartoony graphics as well as the easy controls. Great to kill time' ],

     [ 'Really enjoy this game. I do wish there was a way to downshift for when I accidentally double tap the shift button but not sure how they could do that without adding a button that\'s just gonna be in the way 90% of the time. Also wish is didn\'t take so long to save up 5o buy the next class of car but I guess that just make it better so you don\'t top out in 3 days.',
       'Any racing game by default should have a programmable keyboard optional control interface. I could have EASILY given a 5 star rating if the keyboard was by default thought of for thiese games... Forced to play this on an RCA tablet bcoz I\'m poor...',
       'I don\'t think that there should be 3 different stages to fix up the cars.  That takes to much money and needed icons.  I also do not understand how the Camaro Z28 which has the exact same motor as a Corvette ZO6 can end up with a lot more horsepower than a Z06!',
       'It was sweet and addicting!! Game started out awesome.  I was playing any time I had a chance. I would be waiting on the mechanic to come in just so I could see what my next upgrade was going to be. But for some reason with in the last two weeks it\'s gone down hill. The game has glitches while your racing, I have to hit the on screen icons two or three times for it to take. When I\'m using the mechanic for my next upgrade the game just completely freezes. I hoping management will read this and give me some help to see why just now this is going on. If it\'s the latest upgrades or what? I would of definately gave it five stars if it wasn\'t for the issues I\'ve recently had.',
       'brilliant game, highly addictive and the fair play system without any "fuel" etc is refreshing and amazing. only quirk i have towards this is that i feel its a bit complicated and slow grinding process getting upgrade kits',

     [ 'This game is fun and entertaining and time will pass by you playing this. The only downfall is you only get so many chests locations on main screen and take hrs to open them up. So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',
       'The one star is due to their challenge a friend. If the friend is not online when you challenge then you cannot play against them.  When you challenge a friend you should be able to play the level if they do not respond to challenge after the timeout.   In this event the hit opponent ball will do nothing, and mystery boxes will only benefit the collector instead of opposition actions on opponent you challenged.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by. Wind totally inconsistent, almost like it screws you purposely.  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs and it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.',
       'I love love love the game but please can I add the people as friends that you play with like you do with uno with friends and since some of use don\'t have a bagillion coins. Maybe change up the courses a bit. Like super tired of seeing the same ones in the 200 400 rooms.',
       'Game is garbage, you have to bid alot of coins to get into a match with people who have lucky shots with no real shot control. All thos companies games are like that, tried the bowling and thats garbage and so is this. When you are out of coins is when you have yo offer up real money.',

You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'Haifuri brought me here I am sure this will be a pretty interesting game. I heard hsf harekaze and hsf spee is going to be here cant wait for it....  I encountered a game bug.. I was using a destroyer class ship and the steering wheel won\'t turned after I  pressed the left steer the ship just went on spinning left...please resolve this issue\'s',
       'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'Connection issues. Don\'t bother with playing on hotel Wi-Fi. The mcDs or the coffee shop. Forget about it on 3G. Because you need to have a full wired connection just to not hop around the map with the superb lag spikes. Spending tons of time shooting and hitting the enemy getting zero registry. In short good looking game spent hundreds of hours on the desktop version. But this doesn\'t seem keenly executed. Not connected to my desktop account? Why bother?',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.' ],

     [ 'Love it! Very addictive.  Keeps my mind sharp. It used to give an option every 20 mins to watch an ad to get a hint.  But it doesn\'t seem to be doing that anymore.  It\'s very sporadic now.  I would give it 5 stars if that was fixed.',
       'Your dictionary needs updated!!! Does it only have 50 words in it? Because when I find extra words the game has no clue. Most important, the puzzles won\'t let you spell the word. I spelled candle 50 times, used all the hints and it spells cand,..it won\'t allow me to put in l, e. !! Because there is another pre-used letter between.  Game sucks due to these reasons.',

       'Oh my gosh! I downloaded this game to test out for my mom who has suffered from a brain injury. The idea was to see if it was fun and interactive as well as giving her brain a bit of a work out/ stimulate recovery and memory. I found myself addicted to it so i downloaded it on my own phone too - even my step father is addicted ha! Its fabulous. I also recommend paying for the lowest package of \'hints\' because all packages remove the adds (which are the only down side to this game. I paid 69p for 10 hints and it removed all the add - yay!)',

     [ 'I really love this game. Of course it WANTS you to spend real money on it, but you don\'t really have to to make progress. Just set stuff up then go back to it later. As per other reviews it does take a while to load, but due to the excellent graphics, music and overall feeling of happiness I get playing this - they are forgiven.',
       'Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I\'m not proud of what I\'m about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a "Russian Roulette" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It\'s like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you\'re money concisious don\'t download this game. I\'ve played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you\'re a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.',
       'OK I love this game, however have a problem, I recently broke my phone had to send it of to get fixed. Have uploaded this game to my iPad have clicked it over to the correct game to keep my level however gets right to the loading section then kicks me out. My iPad is up to date, can you please fix this bug. I haven\'t played for a few games, the tempary phone I have won\'t let me play either. Please fix..',
       'I\'ve given it 5 stars but really it would be 4.5 stars. The prices of things in this game are stupidly high and they don\'t make it easy for you to get money and gems. It will take you months just to save up to expand one square in the kingdom.',
       'Amazing game, even for those who prefer to not spend money like myself. The only thing that I am curious about is that some of the characters need to be bought with gems, but then the reward for completing a set is significantly less gems, so I feel as though the gem based rewards should be for collecting all the characters in a set aside from those that have to be bought.',
       'At first I LOVED this game! I play it everyday. The graphics are amazing. I wish, however, that it wouldn\'t take so long to finish missions. I was super excited to get Wendy for the first 2 weeks. But now I am honestly just bored. I can\'t seem to get enough of the items that Wendy needs. 4 days in a row I have been giving my characters tasks and NOTHING! Not even a stupid ball of wool! And what\'s with the chests?! I spend 60  hard earned gems that took me a month to collect, for a 100 stupid potions and a BENCH??!!! If I am spending 60 gems on a legendary chest, there better be an epic character or a ride in there! If this doesn\'t change, I am afraid I will have to stop playing this game, as it\'s really getting on my nerves. I have been playing it for almost two years. PLEASE, make it more  easily accessible and not determined on real money for awesome characters and things!' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love this game (app)! My Mom and I live in different cities about 3 hours apart... we both play, ok maybe battle is a better word!! We battle to take the lead and to see who has the most chips! It\'s a fun and exciting way to keep in touch with her. Thanks for this game/app!!  Sincerely,  Long distance daughter & Mother 🤓',
       'Unsure as of yet. Will update after playing for awhile Update- I enjoy this game. You do have to spend money to get everything out of the game. But, that\'s how you support the development of apps. I dont like it when you can\'t use your power ups and are forced to buy more to get the special ones. You also have to buy hours every time you play for auto daub. Very difficult to win otherwise.',
       'Fast paced game and love it! Chances to keep getting extra coins and bingo credits by watching the short video or I found out by playing lower levels you had completed to play them again to get more of what you need! The higher levels you go you need more bingo credits so this works to your advantage! Great game and love it!',
       'Loved it before the update, now it tells me I missed a few, but it won\'t let me daub the numbers. I\'m trying like hell to daub, but it lags and even stops calling numbers then it calls 5 or 6 numbers in 2 seconds. Go back to before the update.',
       'I love bingo holiday when i can play my bonus games but there are times they take points and i don\'t get to play. But they take them anyways. I never get refunded. So maybe they should refund us our points. But all in all the game is great.',
       'I hate this new app. Cost to much to try to win extra chips to continue to play the so I don\'t get to play it as much as I use to I hate the new update additive but can\'t losing interest because of the new up date can\'t spin the wheel very much to try to win chips or powerup\'s because lowest amount is 200 coins instead of 100 coins it makes it less adicitive losing my interest and I\'ve been playing this game al very long time!' ],

     [ 'This company lies to get you to download the game. I watched a video on FB showing a horde and alliance race with blood elf gnome human ect... The video promoting this game has absolutely nothing to do with the game. That\'s false advertisement and they can probably expect to be sued by blizzard soon for stealing their graphics to promote a game that had nothing to even do with those graphics. Noticing alot of games are always showing videos of what the game is until you download it and realize it had nothing to do with it.',

Like all servers servers going on one server for more people or plain out making it like 3 tops and make it some exciting exciting differences on the other two.

     [ 'Perty good Edit: We\'re in the middle of an event and the game won\'t load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that\'s over on Friday. Do hope it\'s resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.',
       'Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don\'t waste your time or money on this company.',
       'Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don\'t play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn\'t bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'One of the best "tap" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that\'s NOT fake news.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Good game but you need to fix your ads, half the time they either crash the game or they won\'t load and freeze the game so you have to restart. Also the game will randomly just close sometimes for no reason. Enjoy the game but there are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out.' ],

       'Good gameplay but be prepared to spend your money. Like many of these type of games, the gameplay and graphics are great, but if you don\'t want to be destroyed by 1 hit wonder tanks then you need to spend money to upgrade and protect yourself, additionally many older and stronger clans are rebooting themselves so they appear as newly created, but because of the strength completely annihilate lesser clans as its based on points gained through wars, they seem like they haven\'t taken part in many. It\'s become weary and very close to cancelling my premium',
       'Everithing is good just once,problem is about spam unit. Example on start of battle enemy tank spam behind me. And that is so anoing. Even in team fights is so bad when on start in team battle enemy is behind you. You zhold hix that guys. On red half of map enemy and on blue side ally. Rest is grate rly..',
       'Be Careful before you hit "Free Trial Subscription" Unless u want to get theft without knowing. "Subscription Issue", last time i tapped on free trial and aftr a week it automatically deducted cash from my bank account which was absolutely stupid, it should have said "Your subcription has expired, now buy it", but it din\'t ask and straight away deducted frm my bank acc. why on earth it will deduct cash like tht? and when i went for trial, why wud it subscribe automatic without asking? this is our real money dont play with that DEV, we will buy 4 sure bt this is nt the way to pull the cash. To be honest the game is good but pulling cash like this is not tolerable.' ],

     [ 'Old review [5*]: Stunning graphics and smooth play  Updated review from 2/26/18: rated 1 star due to inability to play game. After game updated today. It goes to the new HIT/KOF collaboration screen then it goes black...now screen doesn\'t go black. It now says:  "NOTICE: \'Network connection is unstable please check your internet connection and try again"  Game devs, please don\'t reply to me asking about my connection. I tried with 2 different Wi-Fi signals (which is operating perfectly) and on my 4G LTE (all bars). Still the same result.  Please fix it, I would like to go back to 5 stars',
       'Edited : After the update, nothing change in the PvP. I met those with 600k+, easy win for them. This game drain my battery and my device always ended too hot to play.  Edited : I updated, went as far to 90%.. suddenly it started from 0%, again up to 90%, then still need to update again from 0%??!! -_-',
       'Well, i\'ve heard so mutch about this game and yet i canot play it in this very moment. After instaling all files i have a black screen. Canot login canot try it cant do anything. now.before you tell me about my conection or server maintaince i\'ll tell you that am trying for 3 days now to log in and same think happens. Conection is perfect. Trully sad!',
       'Before the update i was ready to put all a 5+ but now it shows me constantly that i have a bad connection and i need to check the internet. Developers, please correct this because i actually like the game!',
       'Couldnt get past the start screen kept saying abnormal game play, witch i looked into and they said had something to do with luck patcher, and i dont have lucky patcher, i have a anti virus and male ware thing on my phone i got off the play store, so what the heck gives????',
       'got black screen again, just like the last time… but i know, what i have to do is wait patiently. and everythings gonna be alright… so, good luck in doing your work' ],

       'It takes a bit of getting used to but when you do its ok. As a beginner it forces you to use week 2\'s but I play strong 2\'s. My biggest gripe is that the "read more" section states that it comes with unlimited practice deals but this is not true and each practice game costs a "deal credit". This means you run out of free credits quickly which means the app is not really free and ongoing use will cost you the monthly subscription.' ],

Just wish yoou could use the store on more than the love island. Would love to see the island\'s stay open until finished. Hope they add more special items and get upgrades to specials. The name is cute, and so are the little characters.',

It is taking FOREVVVVER for those zombies to mine so why not let us mine the big island ourselves. It would also be a humongous help to all us players of this game if you would put in a daily bonus wheel where we could spin it and earn zombie bucks and other things.

     [ 'I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ❤',
       'I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it\'s designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?',
       'The story-writing is really well done and the art is gorgeous. My only problem is that if you don\'t plan on spending money to buy energy, the story moves really slow even if you get full points on the card mini game and watch the offered video ad. I guess that\'s the idea, though, since it tempts one to spend the money to keep reading. I also get really confused with the plot, itself. Sometimes the direction it goes doesn\'t make sense to me and also, the choices sometimes do something I wasn\'t expecting at all given the wording.',
       'This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don\'t give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you\'re not bothered about the energy points.',
       'It is really annoying having to play a mini game to get energy in order to proceed in the story. Especially because that mini game is nothing that can be learned by playing more often, it\'s solely based on luck. And getting maximum energy in it, it still only lets you proceed for like 1 minute of the story. Quite annoying because the story itself would\'ve been interesting.',
       'Interesting story so far and great art but the energy runs out far to fast for you to really get very far, even at the beginning which is when the story needs to be able to draw the reader in so you want to come back and read more. Which is why I almost didn\'t continue and was thinking about just giving it up.  Not to mention the ads completely break up the flow of the story and you don\'t and can\'t even get energy from them.  So for these reason I give it a 3 even though I want to rate it as 5, but it\'s just to irradiating to ignore.' ],

     [ 'Used to play the original on pc over like ten years ago and loved it. I saw the game in app store and downloaded straight away. Amazing little gane. It is a proper time killer and very easy to get stuck into and understand. It\'s just a shame there is no shops you can buy equipment from with the soulbound Penya.',
       'It\'s not as pay to win as everyone is saying, yes it\'s quicker but with normal grinding and combining of lower items you can easily get anything. Vip points are earned in game and don\'t need to be bought also. Yes the auto quest and kill makes it easy but it\'s for minimal gameplay later on as you must actually control and move correctly to clear harder content and bosses. It\'s not like the pc version of it but then again it\'s an app and I think they did great.',
       'Good game in general . solid contains. looking forward to Rappelz the rift :D when can we expect an early access? Btw for the gender limitation u can probably take exemple from other mmorpg here in the store like OAC or Crusaders of lights as exemple but many can have gender and more customize and classes. Hope to see more in the future but Great Game . keep the hard work 😉',
       'Awesome game. But it\'s just that I really didn\'t felt it enjoyable I mean I am a Hardcore MMORPG player but this game just didn\'t felt right. Maybe because i didn\'t even did much but crossed level 80+ and I didn\'t have to use my brain on it and didn\'t did much and got everything easily. Or maybe I\'m more into SAOIF type gamer. I don\'t know. That\'s why 4star.',
       'Its an ok game but doesn\'t compare to the real game itself. I\'m disappointed with the controls. I have to use the joystick to move around or auto, and it doesn\'t respond well. It could use some work but not bad. But I did get bored in just 2 days.',
       'Not a bad game at all and it is ok as a take on mobile for Flyff. My only complain would be the camera controll. Other than that nothing else( I wish there we\'re 2H greatswords though)' ],

     [ 'Having to factory reset my phone of course deletes the game. So I redownload and sign in with my email as usual. Only for my account to be gone tried the facebook method plus redownloading the app and nothing happened. 2 years plus  down the drain how especially if it was linked to my email and play games account, I don\'t understand. Sent the dragon soul support team a email with all requested information and got an automated "we\'ll be reviewing your the matter and thank you for your patience". Umm hope so I spent to much way to much time with too much to lose. Dragon soul please fix this 🙏 I LOVE THIS GAME IT\'S LIFE!!! *If issue is resolved I will put up a great and positive review*.',
       'Infuriating exploit. One of which is when you encounter a 2 roster team in expedition mode that is maxed level and tiered. The overall power of such team is lowered, due to only have 2 heroes, thus allowing you to encounter them. However their maxed level and tier make them unbeatable vs your team of 5 non-maxed heroes.  Please fix this by implementing a mandatory requirement of having 5 heroes in every expedition team.',
       'changing my rating. dropping it lower due to the length of time ive been playing this game and the very frustrating rate at which rng effects a pay to win game.  this game at high end game levels is more rng than anything and not worth spending another dime on.',
       'A great game overall, but crashes CONSTANTLY. I send the crash report plenty. I do want to put time into the game, but if you have no patience for this stuff, I highly suggest not playing it.',
       'Game is addicting and you can still compete with the top players without spending money. I haven\'t spent a penny and was able to be the first in Challenger competition in Colliseum. It lags sometimes, but a good time killer.',
       'Support is terrible. I have been literally ignored. I am a pay player, and I at least expect a response to my issue with the game. Update: Yet again the app won\'t open. Yet again no help except for except for the standard cut and paste responses you can find in the help forums. I guess they just don\'t care or are too over extended to to reply to customer problems personally. Either way the app still isn\'t working, and the years of work I\'ve put into building my teams are lost.' ],

     [ 'The new interface is very confusing.  There are a lot of pay walls in this game, but the added feature of videos for currency made it much better.   However, they modified the result of the videos to randomly give other rewards which have little value. I will consider giving stars back if they change this functionality back or make the game less expensive.',
       'They\'ve taken what was a good game and ruined it, in a cash grab which is as unfair as it is blatant. Hugely diminished progression through tedious, grinding battles. Event battles which are so heavily stacked against the player  that even if you win, you\'re not guaranteed the resources to obtain new characters. An ever changing rnd system which is designed to frustrate you into spending cash. The ultimate kicker being, even when you spend the cash, you\'re still not guaranteed a win. All in all, a greedy, self-serving exploitation of the Marvel brand and an unplayable game.',
       'Can\'t play it anymore. Game will stay on main loading screen and just load or it will load the game then just quit to my phone home screen after a few seconds on being on the game. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn\'t work at all. Loved being able to play before when there wasn\'t an issue with it.',
       'I don\'t like the new update. For the characters to appear as their upgraded selves, you have to change them every time you load the game. Also it is very laggy, although I\'m not sure if that\'s just my internet. Either way, it\'s very annoying. Also the game is super laggy.',
       'I upgraded my rating to a two star, because it will finally load.  It is still slow and lagging.  Wish you guys would have left it alone.  You took a nice relaxing game and made it confusing and difficult.  There wasn\'t anything wrong with it they way you had it.',

What a great pleasant surprise!  Please don\'t stop, if you do you will be the cause of a retiree\'s lost of complete control.  I love this application.  I  play games daily and​ this game by far is number one!  Thank you so much.  Smiles and lots of kisses',
       'This is the best of all the other games I\'ve played. Really enjoy all the quests, and I am not disappointed with the bonuses. I will be recommending to all my friends!!!! The wild witches are really beautiful and fun to play. I am well pleased with Frozen Flame. These slots are the ABSOLUTE BEST OF ANY!!!!  I just had to start over because I had to reset my tablet, but I don\'t mind at all, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!!! I\'m sure loving this game so very much that when I had to uninstall it and reset my phone, I started from the beginning again!!!',

Grrrrrr  😊 Today my chips are multiplied, I\'m doing great.',

     [ 'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ],

     [ 'The game has great potential i believe. However its understandable that since its a new game theres bound to be areas that need to be tweaked. For example the controls while decent, could use some work like maybe better directional controls. This game needs some work to be able to rival world of tanks blitz. So if your in the mood to just blast away tanks for fun this is a great game',
       'Game is nice but the the devs should fix the pack\'s price and add Tier 10 tanks. Should have an option to play with friends also',
       'Keeps lagging me out of games every now and then but when its working the game is great.  Good waste of time.',
       'This game is much better than I thought it would be. The gameplay is fast, effective, smooth, and I have no objections. Tanks need to be leveled to be effective, but the rewards are fun, and the gameplay is rewarding! Highly recommend.',
       'Great example of a well made mmo battlefield, so far I haven\'t had problems with way out of balance battle, but the control scheme could use some work, I really wish you could turn off the auto center for your turret',
       'Ich hatte hohe Erwartungen an das Game da es auf dem PC super läuft und schön aussieht, aber als ich das Spiel geöffnet habe, habe ich festgestellt das ich falsch lag. Es sieht aus wie ein Game von 2005 wo es noch keine Details gab obwohl die Entwickler viel Zeit investieren konnten. Hohe Grafikeinstellungen unterscheiden sich nicht mit den niedrigen und die Steuerung ungenau nervig!!!  Meiner Meinung nach ein schlecht gemachtes Spiel wo wenig Aufwand hibtersteckt!!!  Ps bin eigentlich ein Fan von solchen spielen aber das hat mich echt enttäuscht.' ],

     [ 'Used to be one of the best time management games available but they no longer fix the glitches.  There hasn\'t been any updates or new venues for a long time so think the game is being phased out. The game is free but you do need to buy gold with hard cash to progress. No longer worth downloading, my advice is to find something else to play.',
       'It is an awesome game. It is very addictive and I feel very invested in it. If you don\'t want to spend any of your real money to buy gold, you sure don\'t need to. It takes a hell lot more to get everything you want but it\'s still playable. It has some bugs, sure, specially regarding your wireless connecting but it\'s nothing major. The levels are really hard sometimes but makes up for the good challenge. Thanks, devs, for the awesome game',
       'Re-installed the game because I can\'t create a group goal nor join any. Then Back up on facebook didn\'t work.  I lost all progress except my duel scores. Everything just went down the drain. The game worked perfectly fine for me before all these happened.',
       'I love the game. But there\'s some bug issues like   1) login to claim 10golds - didn\'t happen. Where\'d the gold? 2) now I can\'t even login to social. It keep loading, then kinda leave it at that.   I would rate it 5 stars once this is resolved. It\'s really getting on my nerves.',
       'Game could be cool but has way too much stuff crammed into the tiny screen of most phones. Graphics need to be simplified so that you can see things easier. Overall, the game freezes and crashes every time I try to play. Spend more time making this game stable and easy to see and it might be more fun.',
       'Up until five days ago I wasn\'t having any problems with this game and I played it nearly everyday. Now I can open the app but nothing happens when I click on any part of the game. This has kept me from being able to do anything with the game for nearly a week. I\'ve missed out on events and opportunities to move up on leaderboards. Please fix the app. I enjoy the game and I don\'t want to lose progress because of a technical error.' ],

     [ 'The " DragonStones Kingdoms " gameplay is well, easy to control but I suggest if Ember could improve the map feature for bigger & flexibility view the entirely realm, available for zoom in / out , it would be easier for gamers    2) A suggestion to create more limited time events with limited rewards ( some rare ones ) ofcourse . Ltd events related to battle other than the battle league, like once or twice a day, gamer would love that for sure.   3) Create feature for gift sending and item swapping and lastly a replay feature for any battle results.

When u get attacked your reports will say no troops died but they have been injured, but u will see in game your troops will be dead even if hard reports say a totally different.

If you could positing each operator where you like, would make the game very good. The developers need to sort the bugs out and the black squares with software freezing.',

The only drawback I found with this game is that the cost of upgrades when compared to the payouts after the missions is way too less. This is good game but needs improvements on this. Hoping that you\'ll will work on it. Also the wait time between missions is way too much time. Needs improvement on this as well.',

One after another, sometimes in the middle of a mission or right after completing one before it saves. I\'ve had to stop playing before for over an hour, error code after error code after error code. Close app and reopen, error code, even when on Wi-Fi. Next time I\'m deleting the app.',

     [ 'Love the game.  Hidden objects are challenging and the story line is interesting enough.  I like that game play is tied to building up your island.  It makes for a more interesting and multifaceted experience.  Love the new storage ship.  Think that being penalized to use it stinks.  I can see a penalty for selling objects, but stored objects can still be used, so shouldn\'t lose their value to be in storage.',
       'Have been playing for a long while now and loving it. But a bit discouraged now. Spent a month basically trying to complete a collection. Was short one. You can\'t purchase with coins. It was a reward box for completing a scene. Could never get it and I play long and faithfully every day. You can buy the boxes but thought my faithful play would pay off. Not! No time left to finish yet another scene so I lose getting the grand prize. Just a heads up to others so not to get disappointed.  Putting that aside, I love the game.',
       'Starts out great but game slows as more is required to advance and fewer tokens are given. Played out energy bar after energy bar without aquiring tokens to open space yet placing items is required to advance. As you advance, more compass tokens are required to open space yet it can take days of play to aquire one token. New storage is not hepful. As you put items in storage, you loose token flowers so to progress you need to make twice the purchases to make up for losses. Still a no win situation...Very discouraging.',
       'Love the game. Like the new storage feature, except for the fact of loosing flowers. I should be able to keep them once I earned them. The storage feature should be to place items bought that you don\'t have room for or for redecorating. Just buying a bunch of items to get flowers make island look too cluttered.',
       'Update: 2/25/2018: Since update this past week, constant problems connecting. Can\'t play with no connection. Fixed some "bugs" which I never noticed but caused others which make game play impossible.',
       'Beautiful & fun. The scenes are detailed and look amazing. The decorate your island feature is surprisingly enjoyable as well. They just added a new feature to store items, so you can use them later and avoid clutter as you expand. I only wish compasses were a little more plentiful so I could expand closer to when I hit the star requirement, but that is a tiny thing in comparison to how much I enjoy the game as a whole.' ],
    recentChanges: 
     [ 'NEW STORAGE FEATURE - The cargo ship has sailed in! Now you can store items there to redecorate your island faster. Prepare your island now for upcoming spring seasonal sets.',
       'MINOR BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS - We fixed several bugs and made a few adjustments to create a smoother gameplay experience. We hope you enjoy it!' ],

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ],

     [ '50,000 diamonds spent on 1 event and nothing to show for it???? Get real magic rush.  I have played this game for over 2 years and have found the game has constantly been getting greedier and greedier with the amount of spending required to get some of the  characters. After spending +400 RL dollars to get one character it did not even drop the character and show how cheap and money hungry this company is. The customer service team did not care about the concerns and said "its about luck" however this is game is less about luck and more about a  company trying to get themselves rich over enjoyong a game. Me and fellow gamers will refuse to play this game anymore.',
       '!!!WARNING POTENTIAL DOWNLOADERS!!!  Riot games are going to have a massive law suit on their hands with this company (again)  Not only have they stolen character concept and design, but they have also blatantly stolen found effects.  But what has this to do with you the player?? Because once the law suit goes through the game will be (by law) forced to stop.  YOU WILL LOSE ANYTHING you did in this game and ANY of the money you spend will NOT be refunded.  Do you think they would refund you if they lose the game? They STOLE from one of the biggest gaming Titans in the industry, they won\'t care to steal from you too!!  Take my advice DONT DOWNLOAD',

Sort it out guys, and you\'ll get your five stars back! Oh, and one more thing... I\'ve got nigh on 4m credits in game, what am I supposed to spend them on? Maybe in the shop options we could buy dilithium with our credits, say 500,000 credits for 5000 dilithium?',

The wait times are not insane and nor does it feel like a pay to win game - take note, thats exactly the kind of game im willing to spend money on! The support for the game is good too. Suggestions for improvement : Make ship upgrades easier to obtain, more crew spots in space battles, increase crew limit above 25 thats a bit low. Other than that i love it thanks DB games!',

The support is a complete Joke,  I message them three times after the last update  and never got one rely.  Great game ruin by terrible support  !!!',
       '3 stars mostly because the latest update broke the app for me. Didn\'t load, just a black screen. Left it for 10 minutes and nothing. Tried multiple times. Fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Also a little pricey for what you get. So lower the price or make it so you get more bang for your buck.',

I have joined a crew but was not able to join a fight or support a crew with my own space shuttle during a fight....But perhaps Iam too new, I do not know where everything is.

     [ 'Awesome but... Feature suggestion.. I really enjoy this game. it\'s addicting and fun to play. I never cared about Pokemon other then the original wizards of the coast 150 but this has opened me up to newer generations of Pokemon. But one thing I really would like to suggest.. if you can make changes to the game where as you can invite friends or family or even have friends list to battle friends that are also playing. If you guys could add that feature that would be amazing. Other then that this game rocks! Awesome job team.',
       'Used to love this game, but after the recent update I couldn\'t open the app anymore and when I uninstalled and reinstalled it, all my data was gone. It has so many bugs and glitches, it\'s not even worth playing. Been a pokemon fan for such a long time, but this one has been a major disappointment.',
       'This game is the best way to get my mind thinking with its amazing graphics awesome story and amazing gameplay 5 stars for me!! And combining this with pokemon is just YESHHH!! But there are some downsides considering after getting farther into the game you have to pay and the game is straight up rigged as well.',
       'The game is really fun but its held back quite a lot by how badly unbalanced it has become in recent months and its laggy and unresponsive UI, which seems to get worse as time goes on. This is a real shame because there is a really good game here and I wish they would focus on making it fun instead of making it more of a chore and a headache to play.',
       'I really didn\'t like this one. Its extremely slow and laggy. Buttons take multiple taps to respond. All rewards won in the league take hours to open so whats the point of playing if it takes me 24 hours to claim my prize? The only way to get good pokemon is with money.   Worst game made by pokemon.',
       'One of the worst rng coded games i have ever played and i played Summoners War for 3 years...... You lose just about every spin in battle vs the ai. Roughly about 70 percent in my case. Also I won first turn about 10 percent of the time. It is by far the most rage inducing game I have ever played. Devs, games are supposed to be FUN! If i wanted to be bummed out I would go to work in my free time. Don\'t bother downloading this game. Google Pokeland Legends instead and have a way better pokemon experience.' ],

     [ 'The game is really fun. You collect comic covers, which are heroes/powers, to battle in a match 3 style game. It\'s great for a Marvel fan like me. The only down side is the high price to expand your roster. You can earn hero points in game to expand the roster but the price climbs higher, making it impossible to collect new covers without spending real money. This issue is strange because it prevents you from collecting more, even though the idea is to collect more. The price to expand should be a lot lower',
       'Been playing this for nearly 18 months and I\'ve still yet to become bored with it. Yes, it\'s basically a match 3 game but you have to think about what you match in order to maximise damage and win your match. Lots of chances to win or improve characters which then makes the game more intriguing and fun',
       'Update: 12/27/17. Joining an alliance helps. Playing for a year now, repeating story lines. It takes a while to advance unless you pay cash. Backed off on the constantly wanting me to rate everyday, was very annoying. it\'s like they wanted me to uninstall the game. Now I have to go through google play every time the game opens. Not worth the hassle anymore. Time for puzzle quest to go. AI makes for one sided play, they give a good explanation on how the AI dosen\'t cheat, but after a few months of play you will see.',
       'I know its about making money but you guys make it way to expensive to progress in this game. Why are the slots so expensive. The cost hurts the gameplay experience for me.',
       'Microtransactions are everywhere. I wouldn\'t mind so much but it exponentially costs more for you to increase your roster slots. Not for a character but to be able to have another character. I would rate 4 or 5 star other wise.',
       'Very clever game.  Hard to stop playing it.  Would be even  better  if  they added  more  new story  events. But you must play at least 4 hours a day if you want to advance significantly in the game.' ],

       'Fun game, but only loads half the time. It can load in a few seconds, few minutes, or not at all. No way to tell how it\'ll feel today. I\'ve paid money for daily rewards. I can\'t login to the game again. Thanks daily rewards that I paid for are wasted. Seriously?',
       'The gameplay and card collecting is awesome. It\'s great to see all my favorite characters and the game overall is a lot of fun. However the game is full of bugs. Half the time it freezes on the initial loading screen, the rest of the time it freezes after battles.',
       'Good graphics, poor execution. Game became boring quick. You don\'t actually play against people,  just their deck. Could\'ve been a cool game. Linking to Google doesn\'t save progress either.',
       'Still getting the hang of this game but I like it so far. my only problem is it gave me the option to pick Bob when I first got it as my main character but I ended up with stewie? Lol left me confused and not just that, I didn\'t want stewie😂 oh well',
       'Having issues since day one did not notice them until I never leveled up until I switched my character leveled up 5 times in like an hour stuck with the first character for months then never leveled up now having issues saying slow internet I have 100 megabytes download and upload I don\'t see how I have slow internet' ],

     [ 'Just updated the game to it latest version  like an hour ago it\'s having problems keeps on crashing in middle of a fight, it also crash sometimes when i open it. Please fix this issue.   Other then that the game is quite amazing wish it had more fighter\'s though hopefully in the next updates new fighters will be added in the game.',
       'They app wont even stay up and running the ammount of times the app crashes is insane. Controls wise its a pretty typical fighting game. Idk much past that sonce the app refuses to stay open. In its current state the game is unplayable. If theres any change then ill change my review but for now dont bother',
       'You guys need to improve alot in graphics, smoth animation and quick response of controls.. Because of tekken game\'s cult following arround the world. This game can become no1 if the said aspects are improved. Thanks and good job devs.',
       'I didn\'t expect it will be this bad 😫. Is this cards game or Tekken?. I thought it will have 8 way overlap pad so we can do most of the actions. Because this kind of control what makes the game exciting. But you guys made it with cards. I\'m really so disappointed 😥.',
       'I\'d lost my progress in before the bug fix, even purchased the gems. But now started over. Game is smoother than before. The loading time, the packs opening time, also the time for matches could be trimmed. Also there should be the replay of finishing attack. On Snapdragon 835 adreno 540, it\'s really fluid fast. Sometimes the splash screen in the start freezes, and the screen smudges for a while till loading. Also if you are opening the dojo vault, and you get daily login gift. Both get stuck and not able to retrieve any. There should be tab for daily bonus and time remaining for next gift.',
       'Jst upset that cant give it a zero. The game is pretty good, and is interesting to play but after the latest update , that is v1.0.2 it keeps crashing and I\'ve to reopen it. Seriously dont provide updates if you guys are unable to make it worthwhile.' ],

     [ 'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I\'ve played this game a few days now, all of a sudden it freezes and crashes. This file has corrupted my new SD card, has uninstalled it\'s self along with any memory on my sd card.... I even downloaded it again as I expected everything is gone... Gone! Great game just not worth the bugs!',
       'Awesome game but fix recruitment. I keep doing gold recruitment and i have almost all the characters but I only have 5 doctors. I keep getting duplucates. It is like it will not give me a new doctor. You should be able to choose whether you are purchasing a doctor, nurse, surgeon, etc. It is not fair always getting nurses. Thanks. Oh, p.s. I have spent a bunch of money. This game is addictive and hearts should be more readily available.',
       'I will give 4 stars to the game out of 5. It\'s a pretty good game among the others. But the main problem is that I can\'t unlock more departments even if I have money or hearts. I am on 29th level and have a good amount of cash but the departments are locked. So a bit disappointed. Please fix this...' ],

     [ 'I totally love this game, but there\'s always aye glitch and then it blanks out so I have to reinstall the app multiple of times so I could keep playing.. So maybe admin you could take a look at it for us please as I would totally love to keep playing this game as its a great game to play especially when your winning down after such along day.. Thanks',
       'Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.',
       'It\'s a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it\'s way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we\'ve all waited way too long it\'s time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????',
       'People will tell you that it\'s good for your brain or that it\'s fun, but that really isn\'t true, especially since it won\'t even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can\'t even think for yourself and try it alone. It\'s annoying. Don\'t get it. Go to a different solitary game.',
       'I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you\'re hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn\'t even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I\'ll never download anything from these developers ever again.',
       'PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you\'re short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I\'m pretty sure others don\'t like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I\'m bedbound. Please...' ],

     [ 'Good game over all, progression is a little slow and two way to level your characters. Through traditional grinding or spending special gems called essence. Grinding is the most efficient way and also allows you to farm items to use as well as a little gold. It\'s turn based and not an idle game which I love. Been looking for a game like this for a long time. Great game keep up the good work!',
       'Pretty buggy When im in the story mode and i click to atack someone or claim a random price on the road it takes too much time to load and its not smooth even when it is loaded.. Anyway i got spammed with 210 notifications for around 1 minute and i was like wtfff.. The game is good but it needs to get optimised. LG G3.',
       'Nice graphic and control, but also have a same issues as other player where it have a bug to connect so i need to restart phone, and anyway maybe it game will closed soon coz i just saw a old review when 2016 and so rare to find a new review in 2017.  Hope the game will improve to be better or maybe make another better game.  So sorry if i make fault on this review and thanks :)',
       'I mean really? I leave a 2 star rating yesterday talking about how the game still has the bugs it did two years ago when I last played and enjoyed it after re-downloading. I wake up this morning with FIFTY THREE identical push notifications from the game. Still won\'t load past 62% on the opening screen. It\'s apparent JuiceBox has no intention of fixing these issues after multiple years, guess I\'m on to better games.',
       'I love this game. I find the strategy requirement, however small it may be, makes this a good game. The energy system is unique without making the game boring too repetitive. Also, unlike other games, energy recharges fairly quickly. Graphics aren\'t exactly something to write home about but they aren\'t bad for a mobile game. All of this is awesome, however, I can\'t play the game anymore. I try to load it and it reaches 62% and then says there was an error and to close the app and try again. Fix this and I\'ll fix this review',
       'Great game but it has a multitude of bugs There is a glitch where the move arrow doesn\'t show on the screen. Other than that its a 5 star game. It also said it would give me 100 diamonds if i rated 5 stars and I truly would do anyways but I never had gotten anything.' ],

     [ 'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over £200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'The game overall is brilliant! I love the pixelated graphics. The equipment is epic for a pixel game. It\'s an easy game to play, but is strategic as well! Also...it doesn\'t require much space! My down sides would be the controls. I have had them glitch on me before, but...that won\'t lower my rating at all! If I had to suggest one thing...it would be to add more customization for your character. I was looking for a long braid for hair, but wasn\'t there. So, some more choices would be an up. But, as I said, all in all...a perfect 5 star game.',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!' ],

When i do so it shows the doubled value with the option to double again, and again the process can be repeated. This has amazing potential, But im really curious about how much Wiz is involved with this project, hmu i have plenty of ideas to make this game amazing--- love the new strains and goals btw! Keep up the amazing progress',
       'Its not to bad if you can handle watching all the full length commercials to earn your gems.   The Facebook option sucks,,,,,  and its a waist of a good bong and couch .........Not everbody wants to be on facebook to achieve higher levels in a game.  Maybe create a lounge area where you can kick back smoke a doobie and socialize with other game players.',
       'I\'m killing this games in two days I got to level 40. The strains are accurate with the reviews as well. Great game love the challenges. Played first tournament and won by over 1000. Hard work pays off just like real growing',
       'DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ENJOY WATCHING ADS !!!Another potentially  great game ruined by ads. not even a minute in the game and it tells me I need to watch ads. watching ads should be optional in all games and not forced upon your clients by making the game too hard to play without watching the ads. I don\'t get why game developers can\'t just make a great game you want to make purchases in. ads generate revenue for the game developers. let\'s not get them rich off of terrible IN game ads. Hempire is a great weed growing game. check it out n u will not be dissatisfied as you will be playing this garbage.',
       'Great game. The only thing I don\'t like is when you get jars there are too many  duplicate pieces but other than that awesome game',
       'I love this game but its on its way off my phone. The video ads are not giving the bonus they are supposed to. Please fix this! If the game requires 30 second videos to put out the bonus, then why are you showing 15 second ones? Its bad enough that we have to watch them at all please fix this.' ],

Really the only way you can stand a chance is buying packs  which still doesn\'t help as higher levels can attack and steal it. Finally the moderators are non existing and are often apart of the large groups attacking you. A terrible waste of time and money.',

       'It has a lot of room for improvement, I hope to see more as I play.  Edit: from 5 stars to 3 stars, many problems from the start get ignored by devs due to rich kids pumping money into the game, still an OK game though.',
       'Devs should add events or something where prizes has shields. Killing event is just too much a pain where bullying is tolerated. Universal shards are not universal as it covers only a few selected enabler shards...shady! Also sometimes or first log-in of the day it opens with phone media volume maxed and unchangable in-game, too loud. But overall not regreting installing this and will stay in phone for a long time.',
       'The game is great I enjoy playing it but I have two issues with it,   The chat censors are honestly a bit much, simple words that shouldn\'t be censored are and it\'s really annoying.  And the Grammer when taking the girls out on dates is so horrid I can barely understand what the actual heck is going on. I like reading the stories but I can\'t read if I can\'t understand' ],

     [ 'Not completely sold on the game. Major problem: hoarfrost was not designed for touchscreen! Trying to clear the frost moves the screen, pulls down drop down menu from the top, pauses repeatedly, zooms & unzooms repeatedly...nightmare! Game has too much going on with collections, story, various games....to enjoy the game. I like the parts where I find stuff. The rest just gets in the way and bores me.',
       'Good game and great entertainment so far, been playing for about 10 days. Some levels challenging but not enough to be discouraging. Good way to develop focus, observation and memory. Those rubies are hard to get though and expensive in real money...',
       'It\'s fun. It reminds me of another game I used to play, not sure if it based on that or by another company. I find the puzzles OK. Some are getting a bit difficult. I enjoy playing it but I get the feeling very soon I will have to spend some real pennies and when that happens I will probably stop playing.',
       'Time is far too short on some of the more difficult areas such as matching pairs and on others an abundance of it! But an enjoyable game so far though I only only been playing for a few days. Lots of options to buy but I intend to play this as a free game and see how far it takes me.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game.  You don\'t have to spend money to enjoy it either.  Illustrated beautifully and I love the fact items move around plus also have different modes to keep you intrigued. I only find it frustrating not having enough energy to keep seeking',
       'Really like this game, although some parts are not made very clear. I don\'t understand parts of it, but I\'m getting there. And it\'s a but clunky but maybe that\'s because I\'m on my tablet. As with all games, not enough, or big enough, rewards!' ],

     [ 'Ive been in love with MtG for over 20 years and upon seeing this app its fair to say I was extatic. However I have to agree with Andre Deen, The game does not follow its own rules. I had a battle in chapter 1 where I got to take 3 moves in total, from 64 health with a lvl 25 Nissa to death in 3 moves.... Dafuq. Never would this happen.',
       'Do the trainings, they are very helpful. Strategy, once you figure it out the game, is tops. Free exclusive rare if you enter referral code 19h56 - I\'ve been playing a lot so if you want a really great card, enter my code when you\'re in the activity hub!',
       'I won\'t pay another cent of real money on this app until they fix the unequal AI balance for gem matching. Bunch of scivers. Why do we have to play against AI in the first place. Aren\'t they talented enough to go for REAL Player one on one mode. So disappointed.',
       'I\'ve spent  quite a bit of time and money on this game in the past when it was challenging but fair. The game has become predictable and one sided. On average I \'ll match three the ai  matches twelve and does whatever it wants .for example the ai matches gems, cascades, it\'s ability appears and uses it in the middle of the same play? what\'s the point of getting good cards if the AI will not follow rules and do whatever it wants? I\'ve lost motivation, and others will also stop playing this game  if  changes in this area are not  carried out.',
       'Game is not balanced at all,  relies too much on luck, which is exactly what Magic the Gathering tries to avoid. OK to play for free but you\'d need to get your head checked if you think about spending any money on it. The only thing that makes it worth  your time is the lore borrowed from Magic the gathering.',
       'I like the concept of making Magic: the Gathering into a turn based strategy game, but in turning it into a tile matching game, there are a lot of balancing issues between the pieces, or cards for the mobile game, and what they do inside of the card game made by Wizard\'s of the Coast. Mechanics are wonky, and my biggest complaint is that the game is free to play, BUT it is definitely pay to win. I get that this has been attempted to be flushed out through the ranking/tier system, but it still shows who pays to win and who casually plays. Especially when it comes to planeswalkers.' ],

     [ 'Played many times and game play is ok and its quick to connect to opponents. But the dice suck!! Not sour grapes but all to often when you are in an unbeatable position the opponent will throw 4 doubles or exactly the right sequence of dice to win. This im sure is to encourage payment of coins. Not the best because of this bit could be.  Its a shame it ruins the fun totally!! Edited as the dice really are pants! Ive played many backgammon games online and they do not re-act like these do. There is definatly an issue that needs to be resolved as they don\'t drop as they should. I am sure the other reviews are accurate regarding the dice',
       'Really?? Its absolutly riggged!!, cant believe people rate it 5 stars... first you win, they ask u to rate it and them you lose with impossible dice combinations... dont waste your time and money with this app.',
       'I\'ve been playing this on my computer & 2 other cell phone for months. Since Xmas update I have installed & uninstalled from my cell 35x & the screen locks every time at 94% & won\'t play. PLEASE FIX!  Game was the best I\'ve found & I really enjoyed playing it.  Almost Impossible to use skills against unbelievable - impossible rolls & Dbls. Some players know how to hack game.  I Played in clubs professionally 38 yrs.  When I\'m winning other players roll 6-7 dbls in a row & win with impossible odds at the end of the game. 14 dbls in 1 game - NOT in real life. Never in life rolled 10 dbls in 1 game.',
       'This game is full of shit. The logic behind the dice is rigged to roll the exact numbers for you to lose. This in return causes you to lose free money and spend real money to purchase more. You can predict what it will roll. Uninstalled this!',
       'The game is rigged and they steal 25% of all your winnings... They\'re after your credit card like starved vampires after fresh blood! AVOID IT',
       'Ive had Backgammon Live and Playgem. This game seems a little better. Seems to help other players. Don\'t tell me the luck of the rolls!!!!' ],

     [ 'I enjoy the breeding and the animals, however the battle mechanics make no sense. I followed the FAQ guide (more like 2 sentences really) and my level 10 rare monster still lost to a level 2 common monster, even with type effectiveness.  If the battle system is fixed, then I will rate it 5',
       'Here\'s the deal. You guys make it really hard to get anywhere on the game. I can never get through the challenges because I\'m a poor person. While I have 31 million coins I have like no gems. So I can\'t get any of the good stuff.  I would really like to see that change.',
       'Not happy BUG ISSUES unable to collect from Festive Flower, just keeps spinning when I press the collect button.  Events are ridiculous if you are low level also forced to buy gems if want/need anything during events. Was a gr8 game but lately very buggy. Please fix. Even though I just updated, issue still exists.... Galaxy Note8',
       'It\'s fun but to hard to expand  to make room for new animals because  you have to breed to get to the mine. I would  like to  see boost on breeding and farming. It\'s impossible  to get gyms unless you  buy them or have to rely on people  gift them to you',
       'First snow event. Got my snowy owl, had space in my nest, can\'t hatch it. It\'s in storage with a black label saying goal along with 8 acorn tiles. Now what',
       'GAME DOES NOT WORK! Had to reinstall to get game to open, but graphics are lagging big time. Was excited about playing, but there\'s never enough time to complete goals/events, keep getting same animals no matter which ones you breed, and you can only send 3 diamonds per day. And there\'s never enough food!' ],

I feel that this is done to influence the likelihood of new players buying the in game flair currency. It worked on me, and I\'d hate to see the withholding of information work on you too.  That being said the game is fun, it\'s an easy way to pass time and runs pretty well. There are a few graphical hiccups which is a bit of a disappointment. I use an LG G6 so I\'ve got decent specs.',
       'This game is very fun I have a lot friends I go against. I\'m the top dog guy highest level and most money bla bla. But I\'ve had a problem that every time I get any money that I\'m saving either to level up or upgrade a building gets stolen from other people that I do not know. So almost every time I get close to what I need it gets stolen less than an hour later. Like again game is reeally fun and addicting but you guys need to put a time that it takes for someone to visit your board or a time it takes before some random steals money from you. Because I can not even level up due to every time I\'m 10,000 away it gets stolen to the point that I\'m at 8,000-13,000. It gets very frustrating when you get late in the game and need t o save up because building cost a whole lot to upgrade.',

     [ 'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!',
       'its frustrating on the pvp. you get disconnected and automatically lose. and sometimes they put you against someone who has better ships and level. they need to make it even and offer each player the same ships and same power ups at the same time. sometimes I get no power ups until round 3 and my opponent is already on level 7 because he gets better ships and power ups.' ],

Their is a lot of bales that are just being erased from the game because their is no limit to stop and no where to put them when the animals are full other then that the game is fun and time consuming. Plus it is a easy to kill some time',

Then the program closes or freezes. Please provide fix and I will adjust stars.   Update: I purchased this game directly through Google Play, the update or re load resolved my problems and the advice on cloud storage was a bonus, thank you. I have change the rating to reflect improvements thus far.',

     [ 'Even though the descriptions and dialogues in the game are bit off it doesn\'t completely take away from the experience of the game. It still does have some bugs, like the dialogues for instance, but the game is really addictive. It\'s one of very few games that I\'ve been playing religiously for the past few months, probably longer. That\'s the one of the main reasons why I\'m giving 5 *\'s. The game has an ENORMOUS amount of potential, I think if the devs got licensing rights then it would improve the game so much more. One thing I really do not like about the game is that it is kind of a pay-to-win game. You have to spend real money to advance quicker or become stronger in the game faster. Other than the cons, it really is a fun and addictive game. If you love anime, if you love fan service, if you love action games, if you just love Bleach in general then you will definitely love this game.',
       'Not very good it fell short of the other apps...it still missing half the content of the others while making it impossible without paying to collect keys.. shard collecting is lacking ...unless you want to pay for anything halfway decernt gameplay you won\'t find it here',
       'Only installing because i spent hundreds in the last one. Devs only care about your money, don\'t fix or take forever to fix issues, and the game is basically pay to win. Yiu can still get decently for free, but don\'t expect to get to the top that way. Take the 1 star reviews seriously... A lot of ppl stopped playing because of this games BS...',
       'After figuring out how to reinstall the game. . . and still having my account. I\'m so relieved to still be abke to play this amazing game. . . keep up the good work guys. But you need to put the reinstall instructions in the original game sign in error. I went through a lot before I figured it out. Love the apology gifts tho. Thanks dev team.',
       'For those who lost their progress, you have to choose the right server in the home menu. It should be there. Anyways, weird way to make an update but this game is pretty okay. Flash sales and stam refill should be the only things you spend magatamas on. Roulette is a waste. Overall it\'s pretty good.',
       'The devs don\'t care about their player base. They just want you to spend your money. I will rate more stars once you fix the MANY problems with the game' ],

       'Customer services works well =) but since the lastest update, graphics turned bad somehow, like the whole game is lagging or something. And I don\'t get why does the game keeps crashing. Lastly, I don\'t mind upgrading one pony once a day but seriously, the costs is too high. (Plus, I don\'t see the point of upgrading them anymore since the shops doesn\'t requires pony to reach a certain lvl) Still though, i like the concept of shops creating bits automatically.',
       'Fun game very addictive.  Only complaint is i spent over 5,000 dollars clearing off land an its hard to earn that much bits to clear already but when I came back to game it was all grown over again. Total waste of time an bits. Please make this different.',

I just want to finish it. I\'ve already had to restart this game from the beginning twice and I\'m sick of it.',

       'Drop rates for 5* could be better. I\'m not saying give them away, but 3% ? For veteran players who have to buy orbs, that makes for a lot of discouraging multis. Gameplay is awesome , and the guild addition has brought life back to the game',
       'Love the anime? Now love the game! Only issue is it\'s a bit hard on older phones as I get killed in raids being unable to control my character due to frame lag and complete freezes, which dont allow me to dodge or use strong attacks to avoid damage. Plz allow.for this in future updates. Moto G3 running latest android',
       'I have done about 10 multi summons and not once have I got a 5 or 6 star character. Really pissed me off. Cool game and concept but the summons suck!' ],

       'Was once a great simple game because it looked good and there was limitations, some updates were great the syndicates and special tournaments. But with a new look and a lot of bad updates have ruined this game causing a lot of loyal top players to quit in disgust. There is basically no limit to the money you have to spend to be within a chance of making it to the top leauges. Basically this game is going down the same road as game of war type games, for a small commuinty of players the future of this game dosnt look good. Maybe a few good updates may improve things but will never be the same. RIP UFM',

Unfortunately its absolute atrocious performance and memory usage means its a bit of a pain to start.

    description: 'Found your own Motorcycle Club in Bloody Roads, California:Chopper, Biker and dirty streets, that is what awaits you in Bloody Roads, California. Found your own Motorcycle Club (MC) and drive around, terrifying the neighborhood and get the district under your control. In Bloody Roads, California you become a merciless outlaw, who not only loves his bike but loves having power as well. Play with strategic thinking and tactic to get the best out of the game and always be one step ahead of other players to reach your goals.Of bikers and outlaws – the story:Back then, three years ago, I was making good business, mainly firearms. A bit of extortion, a couple girls. All on a pretty good scale. In those days, I had it all! But then I got too careless and the ATF raided my crib. Luckily, they didn’t have too much evidence against me. Still, that mess brought me three years in Rikers Island.

A bit of extortion, a couple girls. All on a pretty good scale. In those days, I had it all! But then I got too careless and the ATF raided my crib.

     [ 'This game has so much potential to be an awesome game except for one factor, you require way yo much real money to move ahead. This truly is a pay to win, change that and the amount of people downloading this game will remain playing imo.',
       'Its an alright game and i advise people to play but would be better if people who walk by your clubhouse could be mugged to get more money and maybe sneak attacks would be good so you might be able to take some money without anybody knowing and when people are bringing cigarettes to california you could intercept the vans. Overall great game',
       'Didn\'t like it at first but if you can afford to buy coins a lot more fun. Seals matchups for New York are complete b.s. though',
       'Great game. Cost alot.  Definitely more fun when you have alot of coins.   But bikers do cost way to much. There needs to be an adjustment there.',
       'Really like the game and could be a great game. I would rate higher but there are a few issues. First issue I see is it shouldn\'t cost so much to train more bikers. When you take over territory most of, if not all, the money you gain has to be spent on replacing the bikers you lost. The reward should be higher or the cost of training more bikers should be lower. The other issue I see is the goals section. A lot of them have too many requirements to reach the goals. Make the goals simpler. Also they are not set up in a way to help you progress in the game, they are pretty much random or the goal can not be reached until you are much further in the game. For instance, one goal is to get some properties to level 5. Once you complete that the goal jumps to make properties level 30. That\'s a huge jump and somewhat disheartening. It\'s kinda ridiculous to jump from lvl 5 to lvl 30. It takes way too long to go from 5 to 30 and will prolly make a lot of ppl stop/not want to play the game. Improve the goals section and make the rewards better and it will help make the game more successful.',

I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',

     [ 'The game is great.  Runs smooth.  It isn\'t country locked but the translator works great.  However,  if I could make any recommendations,  I would ask the developers to put in a realm chat instead of a global one. I would also make the private messages shorter instead of long chains. Maybe a feedback option in the  menu.',
       'Aside from looking cool, the controls and small graphics are annoying and cumbersome on this particular game.  Having to building 20 resource buildings and individually upgrade them is a royal pain and also very stupid with the timeframe it takes to upgrade each. My device wouls literally be pinging all day.  The icing on the cake was them begging for a 5 star rating by offering reward to do so.',
       'Its great game but the customer care service is awefull. The bundles are so cheap in some countries and so expensive in Europe and America. Plus the technical problems, I got zeroed twice because I couldnt loggin. The customer care is a joke, they ignore you or ask you to wait then wait etc....',
       'Make available better gears to all. I have lots of T5 but my gear is not same good like many few ppl in my realm for example they have 2000% range attack while I have 1050% so I do not have chance to win. If you are not sort it is just a waste of time. Without chance to win I do not want to play just for farming weak players is not intresting.',
       'Some things are a bit vague - like how to get Influence Points once you\'re in charge of a castle. And the lady at the top is rather... useless. But everything else works brilliantly.',
       'This game is a lot different from other RTS games, here if you want, you can play f2p as well. But even spending only 40€ and waiting for the right packs and being active for about a month u can get t5 (highest tier) and have the full expirence of the game as i did. recommend it a lot' ],

       'Very slow, lags, when you tap on anything, attack, raid, change base, deploy units, buy units.  Just takes forever. That\'s on Android phone, and on iPad 2, takes 5 mins to start, then will just crash, used to work sometimes.  I have been playing for a few years, and it just gets worse.  Otherwise would be good, but if you spend money on gold, it should work.',
       'The game itself is good fun, but it\'s ruined by anything but normal missions can\'t be completed without buying gold from the Gree store, the most frustrating thing is the constant crashes. I am running a completely up to date, vanilla Pixel2 and a 25mbps network and it will crash almost every time, no amount of updates to the game over the past 3 or more years, or my multiple platforms, has changed this. There is massive lag everytime you conduct an action, or change screens. Please, please make it more quick & stable!',
       'Game was good when was under the hands of Funzio.unfortunately ever since Gree takeover, there had been nothing but glitches, dishonest scrupulous non-ethical in-game strategies to trick players of their progress and money. I wouldn\'t advise players to continue spending or start playing this game',
       'Gree either just doesn\'t care about the customers that play this game,  or they have  hired a bunch of bumbling idiots. Always have the same mistakes and problems every time anything is changed, new campaigns, etc. Hard to advance if you don\'t spend real money, but why spend money on a game with such a crappy team running it??

     [ 'Fun game. Kinda far fetched and cheesy but I\'m addicted lol',
       'I love the game so far. I\'m not too far in it yet, but I\'m gonna be playing for a while. The one big issue I have with it, is that it is such a battery hog. It pulls so much power that my phone starts to get ridiculously hot and I can burn through a chunk of my battery within 10 minutes of play time',
       'I dont do mobile games but thats because most games are a pay to win model. This however has gripped my soul as its a game you can actually progress in without spending real money....thus making me want to spend real money anyway because i see it as a good investment. Well done guys you certainly deserve my thumbs up',
       'It\'s OK... But the reviews that say you don\'t need to spend money are lying. I have fixed every bench in town for a week and found no cement - but you can buy it for 96 gems. Yea right. Pay to play as always... Also its a bit of a grind game, doing the same things over and over which just get a bit more expensive the more times you do it. Its OK to waste 20mins on but I won\'t be keeping it that long.',
       'Loved the game until level about level 10 when I needed to open the bakery to make more sales, need cement to complete opening, I\'ve fixed every park bench in town 5x looking for this material, I\'ve found everything but cement. Unless I purchase Jems I can\'t move on, getting annoyed.',
       'I love this game and the updates. But now that you have to have certain blueprints to upgrade the factories and bakery it\'s taking up way too much room in my shed especially since I need alot of items for the upgrade. Including the shed. I think it\'s a great addition makes it more challenging just irritated at the lack of space.' ],
