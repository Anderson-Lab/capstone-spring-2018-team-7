        "My first played MOBA. This is excellent game and there's nothing could beat this game. Otherwise, please make improvement like losing stars cause of that AFK player. Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

        "I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I have to say, I didn't have high hopes when I started. 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop and I wanted to play more. It's a different take on a Final Fantasy game, and it really does feel like a Dissidia game in RPG form. The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

        "This WAS my favorite game and was happy to spend a small amount of money to make my team competitive. If you are a new player DON'T download this game unless you plan to spend thousands of real money you are too far behind to compete. It now takes about 15 million in game currency to max out a character with all it needs. you will only make about 8 million a week if you complete every task and join a good team. So basically 2 weeks per character and you need a minimum of 5 maxed characters to make a dent",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "From the most review, maybe Playstore should add rank and trophy for the most worst games update. And the MMORPG is a Role Playing Games, and the role for us is simple in this game, it is a same role as others, rank up your power, thats all. How can such game be called MMORPG? I suggest there is new class for this kind of games MMOPOG (Masive Multiplayer Online Power Oriented Games) + AEP behind it, A.K.A Auto and Easy to Play. Hail power which is as easy as to pay 😁.",
        "The good. - Visual : one of the best visual in mobile game in my opinion - graphic setting : the graphic setting are good, just like a pc game where there is a lot of graphic option player can choose to get optimum performance.   The bad  - Auto questing : seriously why bother to play if it use auto, it's much better if you guys upload it on youtube as a video series.  - story : not really interesting. - character creation is just too limited.",
        "Well... It's a good game. Better than the others... Tapi sayangnya pay2win aja sih.. Gw suka dungeon grindingnya.. Kalo bisa tambahin Special equipment yang gabisa di beli pake duit tapi di dapetin dari lawan boss , dungeon , clan war dll pokonya hasil dari loot. Tambahin juga sistem trade antar player dong pake red diamond / adena biar economy sistemnya seru.. Biar chat ga sepi.",
        "Why can't I purchase at the bundle shop using prepaid load? I want to but that red armor selection box so badly. Please help it always says transaction failed. My Wi-Fi is stable no problem with my connection. Please fix. I'll give you higher rating when you fixed it. Anyways it's a great RPG, it's well balanced and easy to play. Continue improving.",
        "Graphics is 5/5. Gameplay is 4/5. Control is 4/5. Given that this game's graphics is excellent, ithink the developers need to work more on making variations and unique customizations towards the characters. Now that there is a 3rd class, there is still no difference between the appearances of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd class. Unless you cast a skill, that's the only time you you'll know that character's class. I think this is what Netmarble must develop further. It is already given that most games nowadays are pay-to-win or pay-to-grow. So, making the use of excellent graphics by various character customization and great gameplay is to be expected.",
        "Graphic 5/5 Very nice for a mobile game.  Gameplay 2/5 Lack of depth in character customization. No stats or skills to change and can't change gender and looks that much in character creation.  Control 3/5 Nice but it would be better if we could aim which target we are going to attack with basic attack and skills. Like if we press the button there's some sort of wheel to control which direction we're going to attack.  Overall nice game but definitely can be improved."

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

        "So far so good, much type of game we can played. Very kind developer give a good item free. I liked it. More costum appereances will be good (dont made weird costums). The minus is city is to small for lot of player like that. Very crowd, i cant even see other player appereances. So camera angle maybe you can make lil bit wider or higher so city can looked much bigger",
        "I cant log in to my acc. [Even my friend couldnt too!] Once i could and i exit the game to check on something, When i return, it doesnt do the normal reload thing. It brought me back to the main menu n tht i hav to log in again BUT i cant log in. I even uninstalled and installed it back a couple of times. It feels like im just taking chances here to be able to play. This all started in the afternoon for me. Not sure bout the rest. But please take some action about this matter and/or respond to us regarding this matter, Thru facebook or here. I really like the game. Soo please. Help. Explain whats happening. Get it fixed quickly.",
        "The support work really slow. I have top up twice and they aren't sent yet to my account. Have report 2 days ago but no reply yet. I only can report the first transaction because the app is not allowed me to report again before the first one is solved. I topped up for event but the event will  end today. If this is solved after goddess kiss event, I just want my money back. I wont delete this until the problem is solved fairly.",
        "I love the game its truLy one of the best but after an update I can hardly play 1 minute at most and suddenly its shows unable to connect, I already checked my connection it was good! What happen? The first time I play it was very smooth..please fix this one..please..please...",
        "Awesome It's very addictive! The graphics are nice too but I was disappointed with the heroes - there are only three to choose from. And, you cannot change your avatar for easier recognition. The current thing is okay but sometimes it's difficult to know who is who unless you really pay attention to the name of a player.  Overall, it's awesome and highly recommended :)",
        "Had so much fun and thrill in playing the game. Graphics and overall performance is great!! Though i would just like to be helped with my old account.PLEASE HELP ME RETRIEVE MY OLD ACCOUNT :( I want to continue my old progress but since ive changed phone, Id have to redownload and log in in the game. Tho unfortunately you guys updated it from the last time I played it and now, When i log in using my supposed account it kept me getting right from the start in choosing character. How can i get my old character back? Thats so unfair :( I made all effort :( My username is PetLucifer. Also, does server has to do anything in relation to that? Cause i cant remember which server i used to log in"

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",

After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",

Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

        "the new fusion medals added make it so you can not fuse heros without spending money this game is officially broken theres no free way to advance anymore dont download. its very sad i like the idea behind the medals but whos going to grind with 0 progress for 8 months and still not get thier first 6 star .... its messed up",
        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

It makes you want to invest into this game. Not to mention how generous they can be with the free gifts and whatnot. Keep it up Netmarble!",

I'm disappointed that this game is changing drastically to a greedy game. Soon i will uninstall this game if this will continue.",
        "This game is awesome. Love playing it everyday and everytime. But  recently I have a problem with the game crashing almost all the time. Please help me fix this problem.  I also want to ask when will you give Odin a uniform? A better skillset, a heal, and a piercing ability for him to shine again as a god. Looking forward to it Netmarble.",
        "There are some incredibly predatory practices with the in app purchases.  For example, if you buy the new Emma Frost pack, you won't get her work fully leveled gear, and that isn't made clear on the purchase screen.  You will need to buy the package at least once, and possible multiple times over to actually advance her.",
        "This game was good. The past 6 months have just been a display of how game companies do not care for user experience but rather their pockets. Cash grab all the way. This game had potential to be the greatest, but a pure let down for the entire community.",
        "Game is easily a 4/5 stars, it's fun, addictive, and fair. It has had it wobbles but for new players, there is enough to do to keep you interested without needing to pay cash."

        "Use to like this game. I even spent lots of money on it. This game allows bigger groups to bully you out of everything. Especially kingdom 1308 group WOW. I have seen this group cheat repeatedly without any penalties. Also seems odd that this game crashes when you are trying to shield up. Allowing others to attack you. Don't recommend this game to anyone.",

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring.",
        "After playing this game it's extremely pay to play. You never get notified if you get placed in a higher tier. There is very low rewards which makes upgrading your weapons and armor a grind unless you purchase them. Whenever you get a duplicate insignia you're supposed to get gold but you never see it. Because of these things I'm uninstalling the game. It's garbage. Good job devs!"

        "Overall this game is really fun.. just that I'm from SG and my friend from TH we were planning to play together but we realise it's both different server we can't play together.. Is there anyway for you AOV team to make a server for all SouthEastAsia so many will all be happy... sorry for any inconvenience caused.. appreciate for you team to try your best. Without you guys we work get to experience such good gameplay. Thank you 🤗😘",
        "This game is awesome! And more importantly, it's waaaay better than the cancer graphics of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. This game needs strategy and teamwork, unlike MLBB, it's a very easy game that doesn't require brains. MLBB has a lot of cancer players, trashtalkers, and stupid players. Although, you can never remove those kind of players but at least they stay in MLBB, and smarter people plays this. This is the best MOBA on smartphones! Kudos!",
        "I seriously love this game and got me hooked to MOBA games. One quirk though, I got the skin for Astrid which looks like Arthuria from Fate Stay Night. One suggestion is to make her sword glow gold instead of red to make it match more to Arthuria (Saber). Thanks! Keep up the good work!",
        "So I played to get the heroes for free on road to glory. but then there was this one hero i liked. maloch. it says i have already gotten it. but i can't use it since i havent acquired the hero. and i cant buy it. so kept playing to get the next hero and still the same problem. its like its giving me false hope or assumption that i could get those heroes. but no guess i was wrong. or it is a bug. fix this asap",
        "I'm done. At least balance the matchmaking system and determine a players skill level. I was on Gold 3 then back to Silver 1 again? Wow Tencent. Good job making an enjoyable game, but this won't make me say that this MOBA is fine for me. Fix the issues first.",
        "update I wonder why game app like R.O.S and this moba AOV need a huge update. Please make this game using abit amount of size from before & please make game more balance. Player with low connection please dont make them didn't join any rank match or what.. they always make our game really bad"

Healing still fails when heroes uses their 4th skill at the same time with the heal(eg. Leo's passion skill cutscene doesn't interact with any heals) and its frustrating.  Will change stars once bug is fixed",

        "Enjoyed the early phase of the game but as days go by, it is getting boring and boring. Lack of events, very slow grind time (it takes too much time to finish a stage, tyrant, squad tyrant, conquest), very limited control all you will do is watch and wait for 5minutes to finish 1 fight, very bad drop rates its almost a joke, and worse is the huge p2p money pit devs. Smh. Not regretting on quitting this awful game",

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I love this game, it makes walks more interesting and makes walking different routes worth it BUT my progression has all but halted. I live in a quite neighbourhood with limited players which is not the issue, raids are the issue. I can't get even one other player to raid with in my area so now the game is basically over for me as I can't 'catch em all'. I'm likely to quit if solo players don't get the same chances as groups because I have no choice but to play solo...",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "Overall it improved so so much since it was realased but I still don't like one aspect about Pokémon GO. You can't have parties with your friends and go out hunting the fun factor would go through the roof if you could play with your friends and go find some Pokémon. I still do like the game it encourages you to walk and all but if you could see your friends avatar and their Pokémon that would be great. Also when you catch the Pokémon the animation is a bit too long. And it would be cool if there was a small minimap when you catch the Pokémon. Waypoints would also be much appreciated and it would be such a great feature. I honestly think the game is a bit lacking right now but I hope it will still be improved. Cheers"

But there's an issue, Roblox pleaseeeee fix the lag and add more available controls for mobile pocket edition is solo laggy and some gears to use are un available to use and not able to okay most of the games. The graphics are  really bad on mobile and you can't higher the graphics which is boring, but I still love this game its really fun.",
        "This game is AMAZING!!! Just fix a few glitches though. I play this game 24/7. I even get my tablet at bedtime and play on it. 1 last thing. Why did your moderators not get our reports and why can't we say simple words when we chat?",
        "It's a really great game but there are some flaws to it. First of the game is reall laggy for me and tends to always disconnect me in a game and I fell as if the reporting thing doesnt work either because they are never really blpcled for a while but those are tge only things but overall its an amazing game",
        "Garbage ot gives ur computer viruses. And games are limited on the phone or tablet people with out robux can't play bloxbrug so its not a goof game and people should be able to customize the character with out buying robux its just dumb",
        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",
        "This game is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fun!!! But then again must of the games kick me out so all I'm able to play is Keep city and Work at a pizza place"

I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",

Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "The graphics are cool, the gameplay is all fun and games, no stupid  energy system allows me to play freely as I want to. This is one of the best games that I have ever played and I love Sword Art Online. However, the only downfall is the scout rates for both characters and weapons. Allow me to give this suggestions instead. At least 11x scout give one guaranteed R4 characters/weapons. Other famous games do it, believe me. This will fix all those comments about scout rates.  Added : the game is still as good as it was when there is no R5 chara. Seems you guys haven't take my advice.",
        "This should be played in panoramic mode rather than portrait with a virtual controller instead like most, if not all other rpg type games on mobile devices. This game is a bit of a mess with its bugs and layout. Character and weapon scouting is rigged as you will mainly get weapons that your characters cannot equip or vise versa. Half of my 20 characters are sword wielders with no one above 4 stars, and I have only 2 weapons that are swords! This game needs to have better consistency with it's character to weapon generation.",
        "Nice game for mobile sao... no energy bar witch mean no limit to play time and anytime... easy to understand system and good graphic... just need to improve the heat problem little better next time coz either use wifi or data the heat from playing this game is to hot... others... it superb game for sao fan",
        "I played it multiple times. I did around ten 11x pulls, and never even got a 4 star character. Truly an appauling display of a gameplay experience for a great anime. I recommend not playing if you expect to get through the game with a decent character.",
        "Controls is trash, potrait mode screen hinders sight, and the warnings for boss atk all look the same. Cant see if i can parry or i must dodge. The jump is screwing with my ability to move, and the bosses aoes r so big and unblockable i might as well forget getting close to it. Rng for scouts is so bad i want to quit the game. Im stuck unless i pay money but it doesnt come with a garantee ill get a 5*. Fun to start playing for a few days but hard to keep playing the game.",
        "I dont have a problem with \"Scout\" since i got both GGO chars and guns.  Yesterday I can play it. But now I cant play.. after title screen it send error message. I tried my net in FPS game and theres no lag. Pls help. Also pls remove the character requirements in the quest. Like Leafa.. I dont have her since I only Scout twice 😂 I think its better if you just add jump button than swipe to jump cuz sometimes instead of dodging the enemy it just jump and receive tons of damage or even die. Btw. Main quest is easy but event quest is challenging and I enjoy it..  (This is the first time I write a long review) sorry if my english is bad. Thank for this game. I really enjoy it."

I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

There is a bunch of other awesome features that you don't even need to spend money on, so I myself would recommend this game to those who like this sort of thing!   Thanks developers, you're awesome!",
        "Servers seem to be stabilizing so I'm going to change my 1 star review to 3. This game would have been great if they used the same graphics as the story. In this day and age developers have made huge leaps forward in the department and this game doesn't show it. Its jam packed with things to do, customization and other things. If they update the graphics this game would be the masterpiece that it needs to be!",
        "Doesn't seem to work on my mobile data? I don't have high-speed, but other MMORPGs work perfectly fine on average speed. I get the error message \"Server Connection Lost (0)-1\" or something every time I load it, and have yet to get farther than the loading screen (where the current event pop-up comes on, after the download loading screen.) I was really looking forward to playing. If I can get the app to work (going to try online tomorrow!), I'll happily change my review! I'd really like this to work on my data, though; I don't have wifi at home.",
        "Fantastic game it takes some time to get used to the camera angles (It would be even better if you could rotate the camera around your character, it improves the atmosphere). Combat is ... Well it takes time to get used to that too that could use some improvements. Character design is good I like it Story is good also (Still progressing). Overall great game few small updates and changes will make it a even better game.",
        "Just as a personal opinion, a 60 fps option would be a good  initial long term patch to be working on. Also you need to realize the fan base your working with, I haven't played the pc version but it looks like some of your fans transitioning from pc top mobile aren't very happy.  Also the mobile rpg type game fans are pretty hard to please initially, we've probably been through tons of other games with the same approach as you. Other than that I would think about how to polish the game up a bit more, maybe look at other games and see what elements make them look polished verses your own game?",
        "I played this game religiously on PC, beat the main story. Hit Max level, made a massive guild. And also spent 100s of dollars on skins and rubies. I have 2 questions, 1) can we link our oc accounts 2) why isn't there a skin color change option on mobile?"

I missed playing games like this so much and I must say this game brings back memories when I played Naruto crazily. Brings the crazy inner gamer out! So yes! I love this game! Thank you♡ And everything is perfect too!",

One problem that have occured for some time, there's no more english subtitles. I don't know what will be the reason for that, but please bring it back. The cutscenes are not useful if you can't understand it.",
        "Its got amazing graphics and great gameplay..but when i close the game for a short time and reload it..the screen always goes black and nothing loads. Ive already tried force stop and unstalling and reinstalling it and 80% of the time its a black screen! Please fix it!! It's certainly worth 5 stars if it loaded 100% of the time! Thanks :)",
        "Best app ever. I really like It but one problem. Can you please allow spaces on the name like  *Otaku world*  Because it would be more better :D  And I like All the character's and the kawaii Ai chan :3  I really do like this game. I love anime and I love how you can chat with your friends. But if you touch the person in the menu like when you touch the Tummy when your on to the next heart. Can she PLEASE say *Baka! Watashi no yo ni watashi ni furenaide kudasai!* If you know what this means. Your Game is very fun ;)",
        "I'm surprised by how much I really enjoy this game. This really does deserve a 5 star but the reason why I'm only giving 4 is because there's only 2 log in options. I would really love it if there was an option to log in using my email account because I don't use Facebook. I'm really scared something might happen to my game progress.",
        "the game is almost perfection, however there are still room for improvement on minor details, like font and in game description as most of the description are cut off half way if too long. also events should be roll out more timely than to throw you ll at one there's too much to focus on. overall the game is great."

        "Highly addictive. Great fun. Only downside Is, when you get to higher levels, upgrading buildings takes way too long. I'm talking days! Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "I really enjoyed this game for a while. But anytime theres any sort of update the app wont load up. And it just so happens that whenever this occurs it's during a kill event. I cant explain how stressful this game can become if you actually commit to playing it",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "This garbage is nothing like ads show. It's a pay to win mmo that brings nothing new to the table. You can always tell a game will be garbage when their ads are fake. Uninstalled!",
        "Unless you are willing to line their pockets with cash your wasting your time on the game.  You'll never catch up to those who have been playing the game a long time without money.  Parents beware."

        "Awesome game! It is user friendly even on f2p players. May I just suggest one thing? I think it would be fun if you could get on and off your mount anywhere. Be it on the town or at the battle field. But so that it wont be used as a means of scape, it should have a casting time to ride the mount. Over all it is the best game there is. Love it to the moon and back! =)",
        "This game is awesome actually but the developer keep opening new servers instead of merge the server. So many people choose to stop to play Seal because of this since less people play in most server. So please don't waste your money and time to play it. You cannot transfer your character to other servers. You need to start from begining. This make the overall experience becoming so bad.",
        "Good game overal. But.. Admin.. Can u please explain to me.. How to use old account when i use other phone? Coz its keep make me new character. Cant use the main. I log in using samsung play. Or can i bind with other account? Pls help me. Coz i change use 2 phones.. And the other one always run off battery. Thanks",
        "I love this game, it's so addicting. But I only gave it 4 stars because we have too many servers. I highly suggest to not add many servers and just fix the older ones because the players in older servers are getting fewer. Like, I'm in S105, and it's not been a week but there's already another server? And it's draining players. Please stop adding servers so some servers will have players too.",
        "I really loved this game. Its content its gameplay indeed it is really my taste. However, i hope that we can transfer into other servers without restarting ones account. As well as the timing system of each events sometimes its not exact. Hope you guys work on it to make this GAME BETTER. Pleaseeeeeeeeee!!!!!!",
        "I was seal(pc) player long time ago, after go to college had to stop to play games on pc(need it for my degree) until i hear that seal on my region is closing, played for 5 years,vacum for roughly 3 years then closing. I just swipe left, right, searching for new game to play, then i found this one, indeed its good, but not even close to the seal pc. That being said, the game itself is ok, it like other game that already around, hack n slash, vip, etc. But i can't feel im playing seal on this game. It feel like playing common game. I can't express it properly, but ... Yeah, uninst, i don't want to ruin my memories bout seal."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

        "i really liked the game it has everything to be best game. But dont be soo greedy. please make some more events and make some balance in duel or whatever because of course i cant win against someone like 45lvl when I'm 30 no? And the summoning rate is low mystery amulets are only one for a week lol i think it will take 10 years to get ssr for me. I dont want to leave this game please make something thanks you.",
        "It's a beautifully made game with a good story line involved. Sure it can be pay to win and all that, but nothing that a bit of hard work can't catch up to.  The controls are easy enough to understand and the combat system is just as simple. It does offer a few unique things such as the shared resource for bigger and better attacks, but it only adds to the depth of the combat system. All in all it's a good game and well thought out.",
        "I loved the game when I played the beta. Turn based rpg with different parables within the story mode. Unique unit designs. I cant get very far with the game because the audio echoes itself to the point where its almost hard to understand what is happening. Its a good thing there is subtitles. The game prides itself on its audio aspect by recommending \"use earphones for best experience\" before starting, and I would really love to hear the game.",
        "I used to love this game hence  I moved to the English server... having played on the Chinese server, I noticed the drop rate for this server is super low. Also the packages in the game ate way overpriced. Some skins in the Chinese server are free (ie moonlight blossom yuki onna) whereas in NA server you have to pay to get it. Honestly if the playing field is equal between the NA and the Asia server were equal, I'll stay in the NA server. Right now I'm going to move back to the Asia server even tho I can barely read the story.",
        "I love absolutely everything about this game. Its perfect...accept for one very big detail. Sadly, the characters that have unique and strategic skills are amazingly fun but will never amount to anything in pvp. The good characters are all too easy to play with and it becomes dull due to the lack of thought it takes to win. PVP is a disaster in gameplay and matchmaking. Otherwise, this game is very good.",
        "It's a fantastic game. It would be nice to lock actions so when you're on auto you don't waste orbs. You can pay alot to get more summons but it's all about grinding out the materials and taking the time to level up the guys you want. Would recommend for anyone who loves a good farm/grind game."

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "Cannot get the app to load properly, but it is a really fun and addictive game. Great challenges, and I like seeing what designs others have come up with. I've won challenges with very little money, it is possible, if that is a concern for people. I would like to see challenges developed more quickly, and ways to earn more money. I usually have very little money to work with. Maybe have an option to get keys or money when voting. But overall I really enjoy the game."

        "Really entertaining story. Great tactics gameplay and characters. I enjoyed this much more than I expected. Steve Jobs said, good artists borrow but great artists steal and I feel that that is what this game did. Very heavy Naruto vibe with Logi and Dias. Then of course,  the Full Metal Alchemist feel with alchemy and the door of truth and leaving part of your body on the other side of the door in order to gain power. 7 kingdoms, 7 deadly sins. This had a good animated opening and song. This game has been very entertaining and I'm looking forward to the next episode to see what happens next. Good stuff, Gumi.",
        "Quite unique game with active players who already experienced the japanese version. UI needs lots of improvements, my goodness! Like Units page must have a back button, and be available not only when going back from Home (Talk abt inconvenience). Loot pieces on-hand should be available when newly acquired loots are pressed and hold! Screen transition also needs optimization for faster reaction.",
        "So far I have only been playing the game for a few hrs. The graphics are sharp and the controls are easy to learn. My only complaint is you can't turn the camera a complete 360 to get a better look at where you opponents are. Other than that it's a great game. Closest thing to Final Fantasy Tactics on Android. Love it.",
        "Best Turn based tactic game. You dont need to be a whale to be good bcos of10% \"rainbow\" summon chance. The stage and event is quite challenging. The only problem is MULTIPLAY. Please make the player can switch between private (code) room to public so that if we only wait for 1 friend, we can switch to public to fill the other 2 slots. It is because if we go to public there is a high chance our friend cannot enter our room bcos of full slots. And then force us to disband and recreate room over and over just to make our friend enter our room.",
        "Game is SUPERB, however it will be awesome if devs could implement following suggestion 1. Quest mission pop up is super annoying if we want to manually farm the equipment in the story mission. 2. Try again mission should be automatically enter the dungeon instead of choosing the team formation. 3. Auto go option, so player can easily farm the dungeon.",
        "Great VAs and story. What I mostly disliked is how slow the combat is even with the accelerated mode, to grind materials it can be quite annoying if you lack skip tickets. I hope they add an option to skip combat animation soon."

        "Time to Uninstall, new server open every week and nothing new about the game. Lag and disconnect every 3-5 min. It's got worst after S17 open.. this game is the same as Loong Craft just different skin. But at least loong craft server is much more sturdy. Please DON'T tell me to check connection or reinstall the game, because I already did it 3 times, connection it's perfectly fine, cuz all my other game I play run just fine.",
        "This game is really a good and fun game. Unfortunately, the dev ... just like most devs ... open the new server all the time which made players from old servers keep migrating to new one. After 2 weeks playing, you'll start to see empty cities in several nations. The dev nees to stop opening new server and start to merge the old servers. If not, this game won't last long.",
        "The game was amazing. Have a good quality in terms of graphics and smooth controls. However, I encountered problem in my account. After I reach LEVEL 35 my character was totally gone and advices me to create a new one. Please help me regarding with my problem. Any reply are very much appreciated. I will change my ratings after I recovered my character. Thank you.",
        "I really love this game. But my only problem here is the  issues of so many servers thats why other players wants to go to other servers to start playing again. Instead of focusing to the last server they had. When saying that the server is FULL it doesnt mean that all character here is active, when the new server is open everyone choose to  go there. What will happen to the other nation on the old server??? Some are ghost nation, coz everybody quits becoz of new server. Please fix this issues. Thank you.  Please bring back my 6000 power loss on my character on s25",

        "Nice game but the way they select the game players within the same \"strenght\" is unfair. Because they use infamy to measure your lv but at the same time you can get infamy even when you die in the first seconds of a match. In that way you are obligated to face strong enemies because your team is good enought to win the battle without you. In that case the game delievers a bad experience for the player.",
        "Plz push an update to hide chat button during battles, while battle the screen should be much cleaner with minimum icons on screen or transparent eg weapon icon. Auto on off header which shows ship names icons etc to enjoy the game screen on mobile.  Ship score is added but how know the quality / grade /% over the other strong ships where do our ships stand on that point of the certain ship levels.   Sea texture and colour need to be more improved, i really love the water in the poke'go. The way it appers its great. Plz add weather effects lightings nights Strom snowy etc head lights to ships, Reload animations, ship colour paint jobs decals,",
        "Could you fix the guild rivalry page. After battles when people go to check the quests etc. it does not pull up. Have to exit game and restart. Happens a lot and gets frustrating. Other than that it's a very good game",
        "Good changes, but could you guys bring back the big ol' red BATTLE button? The new one doesn't quite evoke that same 'YAAAARRGH!' feeling of going into battle. Thanks:)",
        "Bear with me here.  How about introducing a pulse that stuns? A yellow item, radius 5, 1 slot point and stun duration probably shorter than the Tesla stun in the respective training level.  OR!  have the fixers pulse gain the ability (training maybe) to stun enemies for like 1-2sec. Same duration as when a Tesla shield is forcefully taken down. (not so sure about the second one, but the first seems good)",
        "I love this game and the fact that all the pictures of the game above aren't hyped up. They are the real game. The game is good and I love being able to select my weapons I'm still figuring the system out completely but it's great overall. The only thing I might ask for is a slightly better tutorial"

Today 2/4/2018 just lost a big piece of equipment..email the devlp... almost sure they are going to do nothing..this is a big lost.. do not invest in this game.",

Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "Fun way to pass time and super addictive but most of the levels are insanely hard. Some can only be completed if you're lucky enough to get the bonus items in the right place. Also the safe box is getting on my nerves. I thought it was a limited time offer and would go away but it's been there for 2 weeks now!",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

        "I am really disappointed that it takes so much to upgrade each time is insane. I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!",
        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!",
        "Dont bother. You wont compete unless your willing to spend 1000s of dollars getting there. You can play 24 hours a day and you still wont compete with paying players. Your whole army wiped out in 1 attack and takes u over a week of playing constantly to heal only part of it only to be killed again. Even cities with the same levels get levelled flat by paying players bc of all the features u can buy to be steonger. Total bs. No fair game play. Dont waste your time."

The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",

        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",

        "Only given a 1 star so the devs hurry up and get the game working again or else it would be a 5 star. This is the best game on play store currently and square Enix have done a brilliant job. No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",
        "Support is incredibly slow, they will happily take your money and not let you have access to the items you payed for. Will update this review if they ever actually resolve my issue. It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved",
        "I installed the game. I was enjoying it then suddenly it stoped working giving me an error message of \"license stoped working\". I uninstalled it and will try to install it. I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",
        "I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.",
        "Characters repeat the same thing over and over and it gets really irritating. And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

        "I'm glad that you've finally thrown in 5v5. It's a lot of fun.  I'm aware you're trying to do your own thing as far as mobas go but I'd appreciate it if you'd consider adding a way to set up your own build before entering que. Many mobas do the same and I enjoy putting my own spin on builds without having to sit in the shop menu in game for 30+ seconds attempting to adjust everything from the standard builds.  Just a thought.  Thanks for this amazing game. =)",
        "The game is pretty good and the 5vs5 was the update I have been waiting for. Very easy to play nice graphics and controls are easy as well. But since the update 3.1 I have been getting bad pings but my internet is pretty good above 5 mbps constant an bing are well below 50. So have been getting thumbs down for rude pings. Kindly check i have been playing this gane for almost 2 years now. I dont want to remove the games.",
        "I've playing vg since its been 2 years before 5v5 update. After the updates i was start matching up time was taking pretty long and when it start to play the screen doesn't show up, after that it return to vg homescreen. Vanglory is one of my favourite game in these years and i don't want to take it off from my device. Try to fix the issue pls.thx",
        "Couldn't get free rewards for halycon, I clicked on them and it did nothing. I also had a rare mystery chest key and When I clicked to use it, it did nothing, not even get rid of the key. I had to reinstall and it still didn't work, please, help. I also never got that free chest for creating a profile. Very much appreciated if you help. I also don't know how to claim my five free heroes and one skin .-. And it shows I have no wins, which I do, but please, this really needs to be fixed!! I'm sure it's not just me who is having this problem. I also can't open my EPIC mystery chest, even though I have a key. Fix this.",
        "Nice gameplay, very good looking graphic for a MOBA game, on phone obviously. Very nice and comfortable controls. Impressive multiplayer and, fighting system. But The only problem i found is sometimes i still disconnecting from games due to low internet connection, but i got a solid 10MBps speed. I hope Super Evil MC quickly fixes this up. Really irritating when im fighting with enemy hero and you just \"pop\" disconnected. The others features are just fine.",
        "50 mbps connection with 47 pings tested during gameplay. Every time i start vainglory 5v5, works well. 10 mins in the ping goes to 30000 ms. I close the game and go to speedtest to check if my network works fine. ITS BEEN WORKING GREAT THE WHOLE TIME. i get back on the game and the ping is still 30000 ms till it goes back to normal after 5 mins. 5 MINS LOST. and after the game is over? DESERTER! do not push updates when your servers cant handle it. Its been happening to many players but they keep on thinking its their nets fault. Smh..."

        "Pay to win once you get to mid tier matchmaking. Fun still but some people de rank on purpose to fight people way below their character levels. Sometimes I get matched with people with 2 to 3 times my health and they also have more defense so it's as if they have even more plus can 2 shot me.",
        "It's not stable while playing, it says all the time network issue but, My net speed has 75 Mbps, still having problems while playing this superb game.  Graphics is good Controllers are best.  During phone calls , we lose the match haha usually.",
        "Good game  Except for the constant updates and also why when i use a breaker on someone(example i use laura shiba) and as she hits with her sword the strike move my opponent does still seems to overpower it..wheres the ethic in that? Lost many a battle due to this silly glitch..sort it out!! Once an attack has been made and is hitting the opponent regardless of priority moves it should still count!!",
        "Good graphics. I really wish you could sell rangers and monsters that you don't want. It is way too unorganized for me having all these warriors with flashing buttons saying UPGRADE, when I don't want to waste my coins and crystals on warriors I'm never gonna fight with.",
        "Its to much of a gamble. For example i had a match were i started of with block, defense, block. And my opponent had from the looks a breaker, breaker, attack. I got freaking trashed in seconds. Thats the biggest issue for me and like some people leaders are f@#$*** ridiculously powerful. Needs more balance",
        "I have been a power rangers fan for years until the movie came out i loved this game its detailed the controls are great and my favorite ranger of all times is Tommy Oliver the green ranger white ranger and red zeo/turbo rangers and finally the black dino ranger"

        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "I 'my semi-hooked in it.  It's fun and challenging .  The characters are amusing, especially Austin.  I  do, however,  feel the games are  set up so that there are times when  it is impossible to win.  Games need to be winnable.   Some should be just be harder to win especially when  money  can be  involved.  Still, I  like it.",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Pretty decent game! Some levels are very  difficult to beat! Graphics are good, but hate the music! Good game to kill time on a slow day! The only thing I would change is you could sign in with Google or Facebook, just not Facebook! Some people like me don't have Facebook but do you have a Google account!...",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into."

        "Another rip off game. That tries to slowly bleed you dry of money. The rewards for victory are so small it's almost impossible to upgrade your base unless of course you pay for a shield,but even that's a scam cause with a shield you can't atracvk enemy bases.  Everything is basically pay to upgrade or spend forever trying to save up and even then. Bottom line ftx games are a scam. A shame too I really liked the game at first. But once you start buying stuff for it, it keeps you in a position where you have to keep on paying to have a chance.",
        "Many time bought gold as soon you'll purchase gold the same time upgrades of building will increase by 20 bar of gold... I check twice before purchase was 100 bar for upgrade building as soon as I purchased went to 150 bar of gold ... the same building to upgrade... and rewards are like nothing ... used to loved it a lot but now seems to less liking it because of this..anyways game is awesome but need to invest a bit if you need survive out there in cartel",
        "Great fun",
        "Waste of time and money. You watch adds for a speed up, nothing happen, you install other apps for gold, nothing happen, you submit a report to customer service,nothing happen, they send back problem solved and they didn't do anything about. I bought gold for the app from one of their sponsors, nothing happen. I report it , a girl named Daria sent me back a email and said problem solved, guess what...NOTHING HAPPENED",
        "Total rip off dont waste your time or money. Ever since update..its horrible. The developers will swipe your gold away (basically your money) and give an excuse that your bank or Google issued a refund. After showing and providing evidence that your never received a refund...they do nothing about it! Straight run around. And good luck talking to support..generic responses like the one they give on here.",
        "This was the best Game i ve ever played but every new update creates alot trouble and tension of users. Forta spoiled the games fun. Now they want people to spemd money on scorpion. When they make them. They will introduce a sicario for that too... really dissapointed with tge way you people robbing money ftx."

        "Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It's entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",
        "Good game. Defintely like that you can play offline. Most of my issues with it are really minor except for the fact that the background especially things like walls, trees and hills can sonetimes block your view. There have been a bunch of tines where I couldn't see enemies that were right next to me because a wall was there.",
        "Great game so far! Love the old school feel to the game! Resembles Diablo a lot! But I love the Diablo series so being able to play a game like that from the palm of my hand...GOLD! Tons of customization from characters, skills and equipment upgrades. Most of the better items are obtained just by playing! No need to buy items, save those gems for more skills to adding more companions to fight along side you! Running low on gems...just keep playing! Love a game that rewards you just for playing! Keep up the good work guys! I don't post reviews unless it's worth it so......see you out there!",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell"

The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do.

Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun.

I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "It's good and alot of fun but it's a bit of a tedious grindfest. 150% item find and I found nothing after going through ten dungeons. I want to keep playing but it's just another pay to win type. I understand you need to make money but I can buy a full loadout of epic equipment and run through a great portion of the game in no time. It's definetly worth giving a try but unfortunetly it's not for me.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!"

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help...."

The customerservice page also seems to be a Facebook page, where upon successful contact of the customer service they will ask you for your device model your gamer ID they will ask you way too much information that they do not need as this is all computer based and should be quite self evident as to what server and person is contacting them.

I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",
        "I love the concept of the game, but there are some major problems. First of all the sound has never worked and that's quite annoying. And then there is that glitch that happens a lot of times when you try to start a race and it uses your fuel but never starts, and that happens consistently. Please consider fixing the problems.",
        "I really wanted to like this game and it's a great game don't get me wrong but it seems like you can't really do anything in there without watching and ad or buy something. I hated how the are so pushy with micro-transactions!",

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go."

        "This game is awesome and I love playing it. Im trying to build a massive farm in the village. Great time killer and addictive.You can build anything. The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I love this game. When my sister downloaded it on her iPad i was sooo addicted to it and now i am downloading it on my own phone!!!! I really recommend to try it at least for once. If you will do so you will not be able to delete it easily beacuse you will be addicted!!!!!",
        "Remove the villagers plz i hate that they keep coming into the house i build and dont leave i have built 10 houses for me and they just keep coming in and its really inoying"

The overall quality of the stories is good. The variety of characters is good, but it would be nice to have more than one female love intrest per story. Go Persephone! 😻😚💘",
        "This is great! The best romance game I've come across. Only thing is maybe more female love interests and definitely have a system that gives you like 5 hearts a day? Just to get those back because I haven't played the game in a week and a half because of no hearts.",
        "Hearts are too expensive and the hearts needed for some choices are way too high. Daily loggin rewards don't have a good enough chance to get them either. Stories are great and I enjoy them very much. Would recommend for others even those who don't want to spend the money. I myself haven't paid a cent because of the high prices.",
        "I really enjoyed reading different stories. Loving this apps.Just please add more tickets... and also it takes forever to waitq for the next season or episodes..it spoils my excitement.. please don't make us wait .. your stories are all really good..just make it more fast in adding new season or episode please please please",
        "I've been playing the game for a really long time now since I was 13 or 14 and am now 17 turning 18 this year and I'm sooooo happy with how it's grown but the one issue I have is the hearts thing. I can't pay the specific amount to get a whole stash of heart and it really bugs me because I love the options that you give us but I don't have hearts...can you please look into it and come up withe something ?",

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

Game WILL freeze and close once every now and again. No live pvp.  Pros: 94 different solo story missions. The rewards system (chests, gems, etc.) is well developed. \"Dwarven Forge\" is a live 4 player co-op mini-game that is really fun and seems to run smoothly which is great because it's the only part you can play with other live players.",

My only compliant about this is last month I was due a legendary chest and on 02/28/18 when I went in to get my chest it was in March already,  What the heck is up with that. Spend all that time going into the game and no legendary chest,  is this on purpose or a glitch? I hope it doesn't happen this month again.",
        "I previously rated this game 1 star. With the new updated version game play is exceptional.  The coop mode can suck depending on others and their network speeds.  If you want to get powefull fast you can buy you way there or grind it out.  I prefer the gind as I play just an hour or two at night. Lol.  Fun game.",
        "Not as good as DH4. Only one class of characters to play as. Lots of more side things, but most are not worth the time. Direction of how to do some things are lacking, so you're left to feel around in the dark a bit. There seems to be an update every couple days which is kind of annoying.",

Otherwise it's a great game and it provides me with hours of fun and relaxation.",
        "I have been playing this game since 2012. It used to be great, but in the past 1-2 years it has become insane. The events are ALWAYS overlapped with 2-3 events happening simultaneously, and they have become much more difficult to complete. It is literally impossible to collect every dragon without spending some big bucks, and the only way to enjoy this game is to focus on only getting the dragons you like. This still proves to be difficult given the 1000+ dragons released already...",
        "Game is ok easy to follow and play. Constslly full of ads and server sync so takes forever to get in if its lets you in and then start the ads, annoying request from side ventures to get more cash from you. Apple verson has more and programers to lazy to do same here but make you compete against them",
        "This game is getting better and closer to equal to ios but still needs some work. More dragons should have their own type and not all mashed into the star. Also all buildings and arena need this the type chooser. More mining land and better crops are needed. Please fix the emoji so android can use its system wide color emoji now. Out of curiosity why does ios get a new description announcing the codex and Android is always bug fixes. You guys could just copy and paste that but don't even bother to change for us Android users?",
        "I got a new phone and when I transferred all of my app's it did Not transferr my levels!! I had hours of fun, not so sure now. I still play and love it. I wish we could get more gold through friends or the wheel.",
        "Been playing for few years now. Used to be great game but now when I play all of a sudden the game freezes and everything Ive done in last minute or so disappears. I thought it might be my tablet but after purchasing new tablet the problem still exists. I now know its the game as I have noticed that when game freezes and then restarts, I have a progress sign appear and when I click on it it tells me the progress of a dragon that gives you two gold as a reward but I am doing nothing to trigger this. This is seriously frustrating when using a boost on bingo leagues as the countdown doesnt freeze. Fix this and it's 5 stars all the way."

        "Awesome game if u love strategy & buissness tactics with football......plz upgrade the game play in exhibition or others game play into 3d & give a weekly basis youth squad facility....fans need it...& love it",
        "Surprisingly deep experience. I suppose the obvious comparison would be to Soccer Spirits. This is a lot more grounded in reality (there's a lot less talking rabbits and little girls who can do magic), but there's more to do. There's also a dry cleverness permeating everything.  UPDATE: I've hit a weird and frustrating wall--the game isn't clear about when its days roll over. I guess it might be UTC (there are several indications that the game originates in the UK), but for a few days, my daily quests were rolling over at midnight Pacific Time (like most of these games that punish players for not playing every day), but today I noticed that there doesn't seem to be ANY consistency regarding when daily quests begin and end. Anyway, I'm docking two stars (I otherwise believe that this is a five-star game) until the game's daily rollover time is clarified. I had a nice streak going, that the game's failure to communicate ruined.",

I have been wanting a diamond character and now you took it away from me. How can anyone get a diamond level character now. There is no way to purchase them either as they are elite pack exclusive cards. Not very happy. Waiting for this to be fixed until I'm satisfied.",
        "Love the game. Hackers though ruin it, especially in faction wars in hard and fatal battles. For the ones who just updated, faction wars will show up within 12/24 hrs however not sure bout quest mode. Been playing actively for over 2 years, but still don't have All maxed out equipment or all maxed out characters. Hackers have everything maxed out which makes a mockery of our equipment.",

        "I love the game and new update. But i am soo disapointed, that you promissed us Injustice raiden and klassic mileena, still there are no challenges about them. Please make a new challenge a bout those charecters. Also injustice scorpion, undercover cassie cage and others. Please make this right.",
        "Best game I have played, however after the updates i can't seem to see other game modes like faction wars challenge mode and even quest mode. I have reinstalled a couple of times, I have seen those missing modes in a novice account but whenever I log into my wbaccount they disappear leaving me with normal mode and  the tower mode.",

Even with nothing else, I still have to do a factory reset on my phone to delete everything just to reinstall this game every time they decide to do an update!"

        "Best game on play store It's really a challenging game and also it's addictive Graphics are Damm good And story line is pretty good till now Waiting for chapter 4. But in chapter4 after completing a mission game freezes. And I loose all the awards.. Please fix this asap.. It's been more than a month for update to come and with this type of error it's sucks",
        "More and more focus on pay to win and the 4th weapon, the distance weapon makes it too complex and disturbing. In particular the boomerangs because there are almost no chances to avoid a hit. In unequal battles the inferior just got an extra disadvantage --&gt; no David vs goliath anymore possible. It sucks",
        "First I was very excited by the update. Then I updated it and there came the problems.. at first everything was ok, then I wasn't able to win any mission, game just freezed.. Then I bought a pack of cards and since I m stuck In a loop that makes me win the same reward again and again like if it was the first time when I open the app. I am not able to play at all, the app is basically useless now. PLEASE UPDATE",
        "This is the worst chapter or update in  the game.. when I saw notification of the update I was very excited but when I opened this game the main quest was insane difficulty so I started side quest which was easy difficulty, but it was not for me it was easy for the enemy.. I played that more than 10 times but I didn't win 2 rounds so I just came here and wrote this review... And if you think I'm a noob.. then yes I am but only in this chapter not in previous ones..",
        "At first look it didn't mesmerise me, but after 2-3 matches I feel in love with it! It is awesome and has tons of weapons and other stuffs. The multiplayer option is also great and chest opening is such a treat. One worry is that the weapon below the primary weapon is still locked (why I don't know), otherwise the game is superb. Graphics are top notch and fighting doesn't come more realistic than that!",
        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki."

        "Not really easy to understand how to get started playing the game. I had to figure out a lot of it for myself but having to do that got frustrating so after a few days I just decided to uninstall it. It presents as cute and entertaining but trying to learn a game with minimal instruction doesn't give a great first impression",
        "This is one of my favorite mobile games. My only issue recently is I spent money on coins after a level to finally finish it but the game crashed and I ended up having to start the game over smh it keeps crashing but this is the first time it crashed without fixing itself...hope you guys do something about that",
        "Update: I read where you stated\" Our developers only release levels after they personally ensure that levels  are beatable without the use of purchase's\".  I was wondering, do they play a level for a week like I am so far trying to complete it? Are they really playing or it's what the computer tells them? I doubt that any of you are actually playing this game.",
        "Sort the bugs out. Why does the game keep freezing and the screen going black. It's been doing it for weeks. And why does it take so long to get lives back? It's way too long to wait. Currently stuck on level 90 really starting to get annoyed with it must have tried over 50 lives and still can't beat the level",
        "I have played this game for months and it was fantastic until the last 2 updates. After those the levels became so hard it's impossible to beat them without spending money. If you enjoy playing the same level for weeks at a time then by all means download. Otherwise don't waste your time unless you want to spend money.",
        "Fun game but today while I have been playing, when I hit give up it keeps going to the 25 coins for 5 more moves no matter how many times I hit it. I have had to exit the app and reopen it to play the level again without spending coins. I hope this is just a glitch and not trying to get people to spend more money."

At level 13 played x 25 and had 27 spins, which paid rubbish, and all the gauge did was jot out and then return backward. At no time did it advance.

        "The game itself is cute. I went to level 175. It's addicting. My biggest problem is you can tell the game is set up to make you lose. So you'll have to watch the ads to get ahead or purchase coins. Either way, if there game doesn't want you to get ahead you won't.",
        "I love Peanuts gang and I love casual gaming on my mobile device! Great concept, great music, great story.... Only thing spoiling it right now is the balance on pay-to-win. Playing without paying should be a lot more balanced.",
        "I love Snoopy! This is a great game. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star is because it runs slowly on my tablet. I do not have that many apps on my tablet that can inhibit the game's performance so not sure what the issue could be. Overall I do like this game!",
        "After I purchased coins on 3/22 and while  using them the game froze on me in the middle causing the coins to go to waste. I would like a refund please.",
        "I love playing games, but it shuts down automatically for NO reason!  This causes loss of lives and levels, which is very aggravating!!  Please fix these issues",
        "I just started playing but so far so good and as a child  Charlie Brown was my favorite  cartoon so this is very nostalgic for me. This is the only game I play where I actually  haven't  muted the sound. Love it!"

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting"

        "Lolz.  I loves it.  Features and content are definately revolutionary from the first oac. Erm.... Trading cards,  hellz yeah!! Companions/ mounts features(like most of everything in this game) needs research, and looking into,  but most def a worthy investment. Having complications with the game? Uninstall, re-install,  restart,  search an oac blog spot,  get creative and learn your game as if you were trying to learn your characters skill,  the game is freaking s!(|{!! I give it a 4 never the less,(wich is most likely due to my service provider) due to complications ive yet to resolve.",
        "First, the game won't connect to my wifi so it wanted me to use my data.. Fine whatever. I download it all and as soon as I start, it asks me to talk to a flame knight healer, whenever i hit the bottom right dialogue button or select him/icon he just says 'flame knight to me!' over and over. After hearing this 50 times I'm uninstalling.",
        "Lost my progress in the game and customer care doesn't even bother to reply back. The developers don't even have the sense to sync the game with google play games. I can't even choose my old server. Don't play this game unless you want these people to steal your money and time. The second you reset your phone, it's all gone.",
        "If you are into mmo's then this game is perfect for you. There is stuff that costs cash but you don't need it to play I've played for over a year and haven't paid a dime. Great graphics and controls. A couple bugs but with such a big game it's bound to happen. Perfect for fans of wow or eso",
        "Guys you need to be a bit more lenient about the vigor. I got to level 15 and the vigor wall hits me. I'm new to your game and loving it so far. Just 1 major problem vigor runs out in 1 hour. I can't grind for the festive wings because no vigor. I understand you want money from people but the vigor is not the way. . Add mounts to buy and wings to buy add more cool vanitys to buy instead. If I could buy a flying mount straight up for 20 dollars I would. Or wings for 10 dollars I would. Please fix the vigor.",
        "Truely entertaining. There is a lot to do, and the storyline is engaging. The graphics are incredible without being too showy; in a lot of RPG type mobile games, I find it easy to loose track of my character because I'm distracted by the bright lights and excessive animations of skill attacks. This is often exacerbated by the sheer mass of other characters in an area. I have not had this problem while playing this game; other characters are nicely space and easy to ignore. Also; as a female playing a female character, I apprecitate the lack of obligate bikini armour."

It's a very simplistic \"Sims\" style game that focuses more on tasks and points rather than character building. It sucks you in and before you know it, the day is gone.",
        "Fun to play. Just the right amount of difficulty to make it interesting. Ptlrices (using game money) are fair. Even items you can purchase with real cash aren't horribly expensive. And, if your patient, you really don't have to spend $ to play and enjoy the game. ☺",
        "Love the game and concept but too bad there's no option to chat with other players outside your neighborhood to recruit members into your neighborhood. What's the use of having an inbox when you can't use them? They need to fix this so that it makes the game a little more appealing especially when someone outside your neighborhood helps with your ship and would like to thank them for their help and so on. I emailed and got no reply. The developers seem not to care about us and our opinions.",
        "I m addicted to this game. It's fun and keeps your attention. It's always so edging you can be doing. Only thing frustrating is you only get like 1 gem for completing tasks and the job stations get extremely expensive. It damn near doubles when you level up.",
        "Has been forced close more often on my android device since lastest updated. My keyboard is frozen when trying to type on chat and I made many mistakes also boring stickers.",
        "Its a very good game. I think you guys should add a gaming system and a coulple more things to the  to the function items list, a car and driveway selection and some poster to the piture itel list but thats jist in my opinion othwr that that thw game is a 5 star deal..👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

You have to back out and start all over only to have it freeze again. Will probably delete it as it's now useless to try to play.",
        "Frustrated.  I was in the 2000+ level and I just got a new phone.  All of my apps got transferred.  Went to bubbles and it started me back at level 1.  I will be disabling.  I can't start over and I spent money for more tokens.  Very angry.",
        "I don't mind ads, but one after every round is excessive, especially when you can't skip them. Perhaps consider only ads you can't skip when requested, like for bonuses and prizes. I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",

        "One of the best bubble/ball shooter games. And yes very addictive.  Only 2 negatives... bubble at the bottom unable to move to the left or right as in another favorite game. Secondly there is a creepy ad or something dark that pops up periodically between games.",
        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?"

I truly can give this 5 stars cause I played it for weeks and have come across the different scenarios in the game. Thank you for your awesome customer service and great game!!!!",
        "Great. But some of the bonus games for golf bucks are not winnable.  For example, long drive gets a longer required result each time you beat it.  I'm currently required to beat 415 yards which I am sure is impossible.  So why bother trying?",
        "Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.",
        "I have played and enjoyed this game just about every day for a year or more now.  For some reason and somehow, they've sucked the fun out of the game.  It used to be about playing and earning \"golf bucks\" to use for things like re- filling your golf bag with irons, etc.  However now, it's very difficult to \"earn\" those golf bucks, in fact, it's even harder to play the game.  Now you can go through a complete hole without having any cards that you can actually play.  Now it seems that all the game is about is paying for irons, etc., and/or watching advertising videos to obtain clubs.  Like I said, I really used to enjoy this game but now?  I think it's time to uninstall it and move on to something that is actually fun, not frustrating.  I'd rate this game as \"0\" now, if it were possible!!!",
        "It's a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it's way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we've all waited way too long it's time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????",
        "People will tell you that it's good for your brain or that it's fun, but that really isn't true, especially since it won't even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can't even think for yourself and try it alone. It's annoying. Don't get it. Go to a different solitary game."

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog.",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it."

You have to watch 6 videos to earn 1 diamond, and each video you only earn a piece of a diamond. Tried to watch 4 videos and says I have to wait 12 hours for next video? What? Unless you pay real money you will go no where with this game unless you have a zoo full of farm animals. Will be deleting now bc takes days and days of just collecting little bits of money, no real accumulation. I just collected zoo entrance money, a whopping 2900 and it didn't credit my money, but gives me the little 50 dollar and hundred dollar credits. Game is extremely boring. Goodbye.",

        "Diamonds are not rewarded after watching videos, dollars are slow coming in and very fast going out making game play very slow. The idea is great and the 5 minutes you do get to play are fun.",

        "Good game. Would like the animals to move in their pens. Also would prefer to have to make the pens have more specifications per animal. Size specifics. What vs grass. Number of rocks to make animals happy. More of a challenge. But otherwise a nice game."

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",
        "One of the dumbest cod ripoff i have seen and played in 2k18 so far. You need 20 bullets to kill someone with head shot. Dont waste your time with this dumb game. Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

        "Really wanted to love this game. Higham of Futurama. However, when I login I cannot do anything. Game stops as soon as I try to collect from buildings or click on a character. Kinda hard to enjoy a game which crashes every single time in about 2 seconds. I can see from other reviews that I'm not alone. Nice to see tiny Co taking it on board. Edit: not playex for two months, redownloaded expecting them to have fixed by not but nothing has changed. Game still unplayable, Bravo. Really impressed that they can ignore a game breaking bug for so long.",

        "Loved this game and played it everyday while it worked. But ever since the end of the Christmas event the game totally crashes after being on it for only 2 seconds. And none of the updates since then have corrected the issue.",
        "As a huge fan of the show, I would say the game does a decent job staying faithful to the characters, the story, and the recurring gags of the show. Sometimes the ever present monetization of the game can get a little blatant, but the developers seem to learn from their mistakes and have made a really fun game.",
        "Not challenging. Pretty boring. Game play is railroad... Chug chug chug choo choo... Don't even think it developes any sort of adventure or excitement. Graphic start good. Then go 8 bit? Frigging weird.",
        "Some characters like url can't be unlocked unless you go through a specific mission (moon part 4) and in order to go through the mission you need url... You need to finish moon part 4 to unlock the artifact for further expansion for omicron..... This makes no sense, the character can't even be bought.. so it's a dead end for the game, you hit a specific part and the game stops.  Can the developers help with this"

        "This game has gotten somewhat progressively worse over the years. To new players I would not recommend this game. They only want your money and give almost nothing in return. They just took the ability to transfer between devices on the same account unlimited times and reduced it to 3 times per week. This may not seem like a big deal but players rely on this sole game mechanic alone to succeed in events. The devs are just hungry for your money, I love it but I've invested too much, don't subject yourself to this.",
        "Two big parts of what I love about this game are its inclusivity in terms of skin tone and gender representation.   There are four different skin tones available to everybody in every situation. While there are many more variations in reality, it's refreshing to have more options than one.   Some items have gendered words in the their titles, but that doesn't restrict their usage at all. It's possible to mix and match anything and everything, regardless of each item's implied target gender.   I'm not sure if these positive aspects were intended or not, but they make me feel included, which is more than I can say for most games.",
        "The developers lock players (paying players) out of their accounts with sudden announced changes with no notice, thus unable to access all paid content. Also extremely laggy at times, support very slow and emails get ignored. I have spent $3000+ on this game, but not 1 cent more with these new changes.",
        "I love this game. Its very anime like I love anime so this was a very good game for me. But there's one problem I have with the game, why is it mostly you have to buy everything? And the people who don't have money or spend on things, we have to get everything while people who has money gets the nice cool things.",
        "No trade system, Why!?! Plus the reply on boards doesn't notify the person you're replying to; you may want fix that eventually. But that aside this game is great it's very inclusive of plenty of different styles. They are lacking a bit on male items but they've gotten better over the years! It's hard to get a high rank unless you slave over the game but you don't really need the events to get good items.",
        "2/16/18 Could you give us a way to transfer account or change account without installing and unistalling the app?  You did add a 'trading system' however it is not the trading system we want. You only change the name of the 'store'    07/19/17 So many bugs!!!   I like playing this game but it would be better if you allow us to send gifts to other player.  I've seen in the profile of other players that they want you to add trading system.  I think trading system in this game is impossible but please allow us to SEND GIFTS to other players.  3/20/18  The game often have unending loading so I often need to restart the game.  Fix this please.  I know you will not reply but pls. READ THIS AND DO SOMETHING."

        "Let me say that this game is sooooo good. It is the best Pokemon inspired game on mobile (possibly ever?) and highly addicting. The story is engaging and the graphics are beautiful and the nexomon you capture are well drawn and fun to battle with. Amazing game! Hope to see expansions in the future. For only $1 ($.99 cents to be exact) you get so much content. I wouldn't have minded paying $5 honestly (it's just that good)",
        "Just finished the game this evening. Overall impression is wonderful. The game play is smooth, and addictive. The controls are just fine. The story line is wonderful; it's very catchy and addicting too. The \"Pokemon\" aspect that many people seek in games is in this one. You do have the ability catch any monster you encounter, and you do use them to fight your battles. The battle system is set up very well, and it's balanced. The customer service is good, too. I had an issue where I deleted a save file and my diamonds didn't transfer over. The game developer reimbursed me with a smile. I strongly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good turn based rpg game on mobile.",
        "Not sure why this game has such a low rating. It's not pay to win like other games that have higher ratings. It's monsters are way better designed then other games in its category. And it runs so smoothly. And alot better colouring then other games to. I feel like this is what the pokemon games should aspire to. Maybe hire a few of there artists haha. Although if any of the game Devs are reading this. Maybe put a search function in the database cause everytime I click it I have to scroll all the way down again. Constantly scrolling down lol",
        "Other then the controls being a little Unresponsive at some times. Nexomon has been one of the best of not the best game I have ever played on the mobile phone and even better then some of my pc games and console games. As soon as I payed for the pro version so that I could use it offline (which was from the start) I've loved the it. I highly recommend it. And will recommend it to my friends.",
        "This game is absolutely amazing graphics are fun and well put together the nexomon are creative and awsome!! Side note: I purchased the 5 dollar gem deal and the 1 dollar premium had no issues. When I returned I tried to purchase another 5 dollar gem deal with caused my game to force close and when I returned my second set of gems did not appear yet my card was charged please reimburse my gems please please please and I will continue to play and buy from you . Your game rocks please help fix my issue 5stars all day",
        "Hands down ...this game is awesome- seriously even my kids say it's as good or better than the new Pokemon games .... The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay fun , it's more than I expected and worth paying for. I hope this company comes out with more like this.  Only bad thing is I had to pay for it on each device it was put on 😒"

This game is perfect! The only thing I would like is could you possibly offer other ways to get more lives? Like watch a video to fill up ( like angry birds pop) or spin the wheel? I just hate waiting soooo long when I run out of lives, because I want to keep playing!!!!",

The game constantly freezes, closes and then won't reload. I've reinstalled 4 times and that's it I'm done. Really disappointing as when it runs it's so much fun.",

Starting to get aggravated.  Thank you.",

Another thing is, the bonus blast, it is tok slow to wait for the bees to land on the colonies. Last, the yellow bee. When I finished the game the bees doesn't move smooth. I hate some part of this game! Waste! Every part of this game are waste. All parts of these don't work well. Please repair this application. Please make it compatible on my device",

Mostly for gameplay, + the ability to ff thru the long cutesy bonus animations at level completion, but this game fell out of favor with me as B.B. stole it's spot with optional paid ad removal which I was happy to pay, it's not offered in this game. The ads in this game do not even close when you tap the X, instead each ad opens in Google Play at least twice before the X will actually close it. Huge waste of my time & frustration! Also B.B. let's you earn 20x the in game coins & power ups per level, daily challenge, and tourney's than this ad whoring p.o.s.   This game may be fun, but very little reward comparatively & no amount of fun is worth that ad trap hassle b.s.",

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

Apart of this superb  I rate it 5 in all I love it  But still there are online player who ruin the fun by disconnecting etc  N nexf if you can increase the level of life or decrease the time taken to have life. As it weird you are enjoying the game but when the life is over after 5 match. It weird  Apart from this. You are way tooooooo Good",
        "To Konami! Game controls are still a nightmare. Can you fix the right  touch in advanced controls. We can't get the ball from opponents, we can't pass,we can't shoot. We need to do this several times for it to work. Do you know that we buy coins to enjoy your super amazing game? And we enjoy it only by at least winning in Superstar level which needs speed and accuracy. Do something and don't annoy us. Kindly",
        "Well overall it is good... Gesture controls are not that much good... So, i insisted to keep on classic controls... It helps me to make a perfect through pass and a perfect finish...but what i couldn't like is the finishing... I love football too much and i am fc barcelona follower... So i will try to make a sequence of passes and boom..! Goal... But i want to score goal by myself... Means that if i want to curve the ball so i can fool the keeper from the long distance... Similar in free kicks... There are many ways to curve the ball in... And game provides the static ways to score in free kick... So please add this functionality...  Moreover of that... I love the game ... It's good... And make it evolve",
        "It keeps matching me with players that are far superior, to the point that it was un-playable (against the computer). The dpad/joystick is a nightmare, it looks like it looses the directtion that was being pressed. When it was working with matched computer skill /player it and the controls were working it was great. It would be good if there was a setting to set your skill level, I'm not really interested in going through improving my skill,I'd rather just kill some time with this game on my commute.",
        "This is the best football game for a phone.... I love it but recently I'm facing some issues, I can't connect to online players or even play online with my friends, hope it is fixed soon... and I'd like a feature of donating players to a friend and I would like to see MANCHESTER UNITED team and munich in the team list... hope you do these. Thank you"

It openly offers over-priced items like they are a great deal (they aren't). Most of it's purchase items are more expensive than other games. It has a gem subscription but for only 10 days, most simular games offer it for the full month for the same price, while offering more gems.",

Except for the part when you raid somebody and the opponent's team always kills you before you kill them. ANYWAYS IT'S STILL THE BEST keep the updates coming IT IS SO FUN DESPITE NOBODY I KNOW EXCEPT FOR MY FAMILY EVEN KNOWS IT EXISTS GREATEST GAME EVEEEERRRRRR!!!",
        "Multitude of heroes to make your team. Not stingy about giving the player stuff. Potential fun for all, as casual game. Has PvP elements. Energy bar system replenishes when level up and even progresses in size as you advance. Should not be an issue until you get farther in, random energy gains also occur on maps with a little luck. Short tutorial at game beginning is torture to endure but is over in under 5 min. Great free game!",
        "Love the game so far. You could say I'm a try hard because I've only been playing the game for a month and a week and I'm already level 52. With 100% win rate and 83% defense rate  have one of the best teams in the game. And like I said before love it so far but for the next update. You'll should add friendly battles. Such as battling with your friends, clan mates, random players. Etc.",
        "Pretty fun game but I had an issue happy pretty quickly into the game and I'm hoping devs see this and help out.  I bought ten common portals for the 100k gold, after opening the first one the game decided to crash and I am no longer able to redeem my 9 other chest. I change to 5 star if we can this resolved. Thanks",
        "Hi, I don't know if it is a hack or what BUT even if my defenders WON then still it minus my POINTS and it shows that I LOST? Whereas the replay is different. And morover Aria's sand in eyes should also provoke the target. And legendary heroes are sometimes not getting worth. They need Interesting passives. Thx. Plz reply 😘"

Playing off the app brower is like threading a needle underwater. Should be rated \"R\" for language and content. Still requires some finesse when using phone app and Android tablets. Good support.",

        "Addictive and  overall  good game but could be improved. Anyone that's played for a number of years will agree that changes in the last year are ruining the game. The events pretty much every month now are ridiculous.  The instant builds & gold abuse are out of hand. Used to be a game of skill, a level playing field in regards to age, background & financial means, where players skill level & strategy were tested on the battlefield, now it's become a pay to win game where teams are assembled based on how much they will spend to win. For all the $$ Inno is making off gold purchases, they fail to invest back into the game experience for a smooth running game. Example, the game will freeze up on a player being op'd and they are not able to effectively defend. This issue has been brought up many times to Inno & has yet to be corrected. Players know the glitch & many exploit it, again making for an unfair playing field. Many long time & loyal players are choosing to leave the game after finishing up current, active world's due to changes in the last year or so. For new players, it's a fun & addictive game in which you have the opportunity to meet & play with people from all over the world, but be advised the description is misleading, it's not a free game & based on skill as it once was. If you want to win, be prepared that you will need to spend a great deal in the newer version pay to win it's become.",

        "Wow. I can't describe the stupidity of the first 5 seconds in this app. Asking for your phone number? You'll probably spam us. I bet you won't bother to even reply. Shutting down over basic safety? I can't understand any logic from here.",
        "Played the game for 4years, Its kinda repetitive and boring, you add updates but its too bland and its becoming a pay2win game, honestly I have lots of riches in the game, what can I say I cant use it in real life at all, which is expected, perhaps im sick to the environment of this game, all the saltiness..",
        "I love it! It is so fun to play! Thank you for making this! The only thing I hate in this game are the scammers. They make me so angry and upset. But like I said, I love this game!",
        "Good Game Keep It Up! Its A Really Fun Game And I Wish That You (Ubisoft) Would Make The (Ignore List) Unlimited So Players Can Ignore Spammers Cause Everytime That There Are Spammets I Have To Remove 1 Spammer From My Ignore List And Ignore The New Spammed (Please Fix It)  ☺",
        "I love the game but issue with new update in my iphone 6 plus every things are too small cant read even the controler not easy to use i have to scoll up the down bar this i hate the game now i need update like before size wise or control wise that was porfect for me and for all"

        "I want to love this game.  It's pretty. The characters are adorable.  The concept is creative. However, the controls are challenging at best. Also, gathering enough sunshine to do anything is mind-numbingly slow.  Thank you devs for neat but unplayable game.",
        "The storyline is a great idea, but unfortunately the execution iof this game is rubbish. Despite the lengthy and slow \"click the cloud\" interactions with in-game characters, instructions are so minimal that you get very bored with working out what you are supposed to do.  Graphics aren't really impressive, and although it is perfectly easy to understand how to move your character around the screen, doing so in these ways is a pain. I really wanted to like this game, but frankly it feels a bit like playing something a couple of decades older.",

When i was played it at first it makes me busy at all its good at the first but when im actually at the end the thrill is gone.. i have a KRIMSON (fire) and MALAKITE (grass) its hard to get the other Water Type Dragon and i dont know its name.. i actually back and back and back to the place but im failed and i hope there is a healing center to healed your Dynamons costing money..",
        "Nice try but....No!!!!   Good graphics and controls however, leveling is a grind most games you blink and end up level 10. Dynamons 2 seems to mix fighting the SAME trainers until it feels like a recurring dream and an obviously limited numbers of evolutions. I'm in the market for a new game!!!!",
        "Wish you could sell items you didnt want for coins.   Seems lower leveled monsters are sometimes just as tiresome to beat as the leveled ones.  Wish you could speed up game play in fights. Slow going back and forth attacks waiting for the graphics.  Otherwise fun game. Simple.",
        "Here are features that can improve your game Assorted items that are purchasable with in game money,cheaper discatch price,stat raising consumables,here one when I have an elemental advantage I dont really feel that I have advantage because the damage barely damage an enemy that is 3 levels below my dynamon,put logic too,your gonna need it",
        "I am lucky. I see no adds and it's fun. But it is too short and it takes a long time for my team to heal. Please fix this and add more types. I don't have enough room on my phone for dynamons world. So that's not useful to me. Thanks.",
        "Really disappointed...  it is a great game but there's a bug when the tutorial man tells me to use Canned Attack from bag when I open bag the touch is not responding i can't choose nor press on x to close the bag window pop up."

The achievement of puzzled theme d slots are brilliantly done with unique individual way of bonuses and incredible art work.never a dull moment you have got to try this ; been my favorite by far",

Then it's not free when u can't win enough to play ten minutes. Life in the fast lane. A good one gone for me.",

Other games have a fail safe & let you know you're hitting max bet before it just takes everything.  B.s. game.  Not spending anything else with these games.",

        "One of the best games i have ever played, phone or otherwise. Beautiful,fun, and has tons and TONS of gameplay hours especially as your civilization advances and you start having more than one family. Its like a farm game, except your people gain experience from doing the work you asign, instead of simply clicking crops to harvest them. Seriously, check this gem of a game out.",
        "Just installed the game and i already falling in love with it. Unfortunately, i can't play this game offline, like townsman or tribez. Please make it happen for us. Thank you by the way.",
        "Good game BUT Was really enjoying this game until I was required to have 20 crystals to open a new area. Only way to get crystals (without buying them) is to collect shards and the only way to get shards is to pray and watch ads. I'm OK with that except you can only collect enough shards for 2-3 crystals per a day. Would take 8-10 days to get enough crystals to open one area. To buy crystals and open all areas, it would cost me 100-200 bucks and this game isn't worth that. I guess watching ads isn't enough for this company. Will uninstall and play one of the other half million games available.",
        "Do like it, but takes forever to get what you need to craft enough to open the next area. Dont mind investing time or a bit of cash, but seriously.  Keep losing interest because canr be bothered waiting, to get enough stuff together,  plus crystals. See how this update goes.",
        "I really like this game. However, and I know you have heard this before but... I cant get anywhere  without spending money on gems. The tasks take forever. The game has glitches (one of my people was stuck at the top of my screen not able to do anything for 2 days! Weird right?). And is there really no way to move buildings once placed? Fix these and we're golden. Love the idea though.",
        "Why only 2 stars.......it takes forever to build....it's almost impossible to move on without spending real money. I've been trying to upgrade tge worship area for two weeks now the only thing left to do is use 40 gems to complete, the problem is they hardly give you any gems."

        "This is a very convenient app. All of my favorite stories are in one place. Just one issue only, I want to transfer my data to a new device & I am having trouble doing so. I have managed to successfully transfer all my old data to this new app before, but I would like to transfer my new & existing data to another device. I have registered & followed all of the instructions to the tee on the transfer form & it always says \"could not transfer data\" . Also there is no fill space on the form that prompts to fill in  'Support ID'. I hope this gets looked into.",
        "I find this app very convenient and like it a lot. But there are a few small bugs(eg. BMP's scene transition fx) and if possible, I hope the data on device can be stored in the SD card as it's taking up quite a lot of space. Thank you very much for the hard work and improving the app all the time, Voltage. ^^",
        "I have no problem anything except the roulette. I hope Voltage will change the value of coins from 5 to 10(bronze), 10 to 50 (silver) and 100 (gold) remains the same.  It requires unfathomable patience for how many days just to get the whole story. One chapter for 100 coins, I'm fine with it if it has only 5 chapters but aside from too many chapters it has also separated sequels and epilogues. *cries*  Please reconsider changing the amount of coins. Hopes for better system and greater stories.",
        "Loved it,even though at the beginning,i 'm a bit skeptical about it, it is kinda efficient in some way.but i do miss the standlone apps.also the login bonus is quite dissapointing,like we only get 5-10? At least give us a bit of generous amount like 10-20 coins",
        "For anyone looking for an MC who isn't a pushover, try the newer stories. Our Private Homeroom stands out as unusually well-localized, to the point it feels like someone studied the English speaking hemisphere of the Internet for modern slang. I very much appreciate the upgrade in sass and backbone, so it was pretty well done nonetheless. I've been a monthly subscriber for months with no intention to change this.",
        "Prices aren't competitive with paperback books. Why spend $4 per chapter when I can buy a 400 paged book new for $8. Also, the daily login bonus gives 5-10 coins per day; it would take months to unlock a single chapter at that rate. The only thing thia app has going for it is the free story every 2 weeks. 🙏🙏🙏 I suggest making this work more like Voltage's Lovestruck app & also letting us watch adds in exchange for coins."

Just another jackass casino. Plus I have no interest it waiting for this clunky piece of junk to load. Garbage. They could care less about your entertainment, they just want your money. Still a pile of manure.",

All they want is for you to start sending your real money to buy their play money. The daily bonus on this game is pathetic. If you collect the daily bonus every day and save up for a month straight, you would probably be able to play for an hour or so.... That's If you keep your bets small.",

Their rating of a 4.3 is a complete lie.  Every one I know rates this app 'bad.'   Every game on here plays worse than at a real casino!",

        "This game is good and the story was interesting. The reason why i give three stars is because the magic challenges sometimes need to consume lots coins or lunes. And everytime there is new event which need to collect bonbon... It is teally hard to collect it and instead we need to buy... i know this game is free for both pay to play and free to play... but all i see is pay to play since the bonbons need to buy and sometimes events that come back by popular demand also consume lots of money.... I actually liked this game but since you made this game really.... i had to give only 3 stars since the game had to use mk ey A LOT....",
        "Rather then an actual chapter as in some other games, game play is only a page in a normal book if you are lucky. I love the story lines but I would actually love to read the story and not be teased with a tiny blurb of the chapter instead. Maybe if the chapters were longer and worth buying tickets for I would actually spend more money on this game bc it's very cute.   Trying to play threw the stories are so annoying! You need sooooooooo many story tickets! The chapters should be longer per ticket.. it takes like 15 tickets to get threw a chapter! The only good part is u get 5 a day unless u buy more.... please make the chapter length longer per a ticket :( I'd like to actually read a story..",
        "I loved it , it is so addicting and the characters are gorgeous, but it is way too short. I find myself paying fake money from the game to buy tickets just to know what happens next! You might actually fall in love with the characters! That's how amazing it is!",
        "This is my favorite app and has been for almost a year. The only problem now is the adds they can get very frustrating and angering. I do put a lot of money into this game and wish you would consider taking away the adds per player after they put so much money into the game.",
        "I adore this game, I've almost had it for a year now. I chose Klaus and I am head over heels in love with him. I enjoy playing a little bit of his story everyday. The artwork is just beautiful as is the story. It's well written and interesting. However, there's one thing that really upsets me and that's the in game currency,  coins. They're incredibly difficult to acquire. Yes, there's the \"free coins\" but unless you want to spend actual money(which you're trying to avoid obv). The free options that take the least amount of time only give you 7 or 9 coins so good luck with that. Honestly, this game would truly be a 5 star gem if that was fixed. At least bump it up from 7 to 100 and make the offers that cost money actually work. I just did one(it was for a 1$ basically) and didn't get it. Otherwise, thanks for an absolute gem of a game c:",
        "This used to be my favorite Solmare game, but the pop-up ads have ruined it. They can pop open at anytime, playing loud music and ruining the experience. When they pop up, I usually just end up closing the app, no matter what I was in the middle of because they are so annoying. I will probably end up uninstalling this app because of them.  If this was not an issue, it would be a 5 STAR game."

        "Good graphics. Unfortunately, I don't like constant attempts to get me to spend money. The game itself was laggy. The tutorials were excessively annoying and intrusive. I.e. You level up, which unlocks a new feature, which triggers a tutorial, which forces you to stop what you were doing and do this. Right now. Can't do anything else until you do this tutorial. My last login. I immediately had a tutorial telling me to add my healer to the squad. Which was already added. So, the tutorial forced me to remove her. Meaning after that I had to go back and add her back in. Laggy, annoying, intrusive and begging for money. At least the graphics were good."

        "This game is so old school and gta 5 is so much better than this game but it is still worth playing. It has a lot of cheats and hacks but it is still very good. It plays up very x1000000 rare. This game is very fun and if you have seen my comment please download this game immediately because it's extremely fun and it is very easy to collect money ps its okay to play offline and if you have seen my comment i recommend you to download this game immediately and have a great time",
        "I loved this game wh3n I was young and this brings back the best memories of my child hood haha.. the controls are kinda lumpy when steering a vehicle. But all other movements are pretty good. Butt,if you happen to have a Xbox one s controller it works perfect on my galaxy s8 plus. Thanks for porting this game to android and giving the option to max the graphics out. Looks very good! Loving the portal game feel too haha!",
        "Just started, i am playing with an Xbox One controller and everything works perfect.  The only problem is you are stuck with the original controls and cant change the buttons functions.  I wish i could use the triggers for gas and braking for driving the cars like in GTA's 4 and 5.  Other than that everything is good.  A classic game, that runs smoothly, and is a great time nostalgia trip.   This one works so well that i am definitley buying the other ports as soon as i am done with this one.",
        "Game could be grate Game looks awesome but the controls don't work right. Walking and running is not fluid. It's stop and go. While driving it is very hard to steer while pressing the gas pedal. I have Max Payne and the controls in that are great what happened with GTA San Andreas. Please fix. Also could you make it so I can move the game to my SD Card. I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 4.",
        "Guys help please! i gave the game 5 stars because i like it so much. But there's a probleme that im facing now when changed devices i had all my data saved on a samsung alpha device, now i reinstalled the game on my new samsung s6 edge and i loged in, and there was no cloud save. Please help me find a way to fix this! Thank you"

Now instead of watching the ads for a bonus turn they tell you there is none then make you watch an ad that was even longer then the one for a free turn and they don't give you anything for doing so anymore. It's becoming double the ads and half the rewards. Not liking the changes",

But the rest of the things r fun. The best thing is..... This game DOES NOT have any adds AT ALL. I would waste my time, or do whatever i can, just for this game to be funner. But plz dont let me pay fees! Im only 7 years old n this is my grandmas account. Tks",

NO REASON TO DELETE THIS GAME!!!!!

        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Good game but I expected it to be the best.  No loading issues or bugs encountered so far. Game loading takes about 6 seconds so no big deal. If madfinger sees this please add new maps and skins and weapons in SGDZ and enhance the game experience at FB as playing the game at gameroom sucks. I promise I will bring you about 100 new players if you did that.",
        "Its awesome. Running smooth with maxed graphics on s8+ and I had no problems while playing it for 10+ hours.  May be starting area could be expanded along with more multiplayer features and interactions. More unique missions between lvl 11 and 15. Also smaller package (5$) could be added. P.S crashes when collecting contract rewards ...Puzzles sucks. Avoid multiplayer and arena untill is fixed",
        "This game has little bit inspiration from many big games like destiny (duh), titanfall, doom. The game does have similarities to dead trigger. All the random loot is cosmetic, guns are easily obtained through missions. Good performance on my S7, but need internet 24×7 to run, even during campaign.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks.",
        "Literally the best mobile game I have ever played. All IAP so far is cosmetic, which is great. Very similar to destiny with it's own flavor. I do wish you we're able to jump though and shotguns in pvp are OP. Game is optimized well for my mid-grade device. However, it won't run on my gf's ZTE Grand X Max which is very unfortunate considering it's basically the same phone as mine. Hopefully this changes soon because we really looked forward to playing together. Download this game!!!"

        "Players with higher ranks should not be able to play  against players that are lower rank with less experience. Plus the ring challenge if you don't reach  the 30000 you should get the amount that it stops on, instead of 1000 points.",
        "Want to love this game, but it just constantly cheats!! It would be more enjoyable if you could have so many free plays per log in to just enjoy some play, like other games do. Instead you run out of gems right away after being cheated out of one or two games, which really stinks!!  I'm not paying through the nose just to enjoy playing a game. You are too greedy and a big fat CHEAT King and it has really disappointed me, because the game would be great fun if I could actually play it!!!",
        "Uninstalling...too many hiccups! Costs too much too play a simple game of cards. This game is all about making a lot of money for 'King' corporation. Can't really say anything nice about this game. Pretty much agree with the reviews. (didn't even have installed for 24 hrs.)",
        "Absolutely addictive. Downside.. if you run out of gems, takes four hrs to get more. And constantly crashes on WiFi, and refuses to connect. The only 2 things that let this game down. That was my previous review. Now deleting game as it no longer loads to WiFi.",
        "So... if this isn't a scam... how can I quit a game before it's over and immediately be paired with the same opponent. Every time I've had an opponent drop out, it takes a few seconds to notify me they left the game. Every day a new reason to NOT pay a cent for this fraud. I play out of sheer boredom."

        "Absolutely sublime! This game is so awesome it's exactly what I want in a dragon game! Although there are microtransactions, you can absolutely play this game without spending a cent to progress! I have never ever payed real money to purchase gold, food and all other resources and I've played this game for almost two years The two tips are a little bit of patience and to keep on breeding. Even if you've already bred a certain pair of dragons, selling unwanted eggs is the best and quickest way to make gold",
        "Once you get to level 100, breeding a dragon is almost impossible to nil. Very frustrating. My roommate and I started this game the same time. I am level 115 and she is on 83. We will breed the same dragons at the same time, she will succeed 85% of the time on the first try, it will take me over 10 times if I even get it, this started after level 100. Good luck long term players.",
        "The events are annoying. I have reached the max on collecting eggs. I just gather then from doing tasks. Does that mean I can't participate anymore and am just stuck. I don't understand. Why would you limit the gathering of items?",
        "Have been playing this game for a couple of years now and I love it! Sometimes it's frustrating - especially when you'd need to buy something to be able to get all the prizes during events - but it just makes it more challenging.  VERY happy with the customer support. I had an issue with a gift not being added to my totals, so I emailed them and they fixed it without issue.",
        "The game is definitely addicting. But when I went into the Egg-straordinary Egg hunt island and tapped on a activty, it said their was a wonky spell and it completely stopped the whole game. I've tried different things different times, and it still won't work. I have played this in the past and the same exact thing happened, but with something different.",
        "This game is AWSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOme. I had 1023 gems saved up and then it glitched and now I only have 34. I love this game so much! Please help me get my 984 gems back! I don't want to rate it lower than 5 stars, but this has happened twice now...😟"

        "I'm a big mahjong player and this game is like mahjong on crack. i definitely recommend it to my fellow mahjong nerds. it's awesome with how many levels there are and boosters and achievements and the whole shebang. not just a regular mahjong game where you can only play the game and nothing more. if you like the whole saving up crystals and buying boosters and earning achievements jawn, then you'll love this game. side note, I also have not spent real life money on this game mostly because I don't need to. I usually will buy stuff for games only because I use the money I get from my Google rewards app cause that money goes straight into my Google play account. so it's not that I'm anti spending money on games, but I haven't yet felt like I needed to. it's not one of those where you need to spend money to have it be fun at all (well, not yet anyway! hopefully that won't change) or to be able to get past a certain point. so I totally recommend this to all my mahjong nerd brothers and sisters!",
        "It is a shame that this game allows one to start a new mod and a day or two later sends the player back to the original mod to collect hats, lanterns or eggs. A more polite end to an uncompleted game would be \"Try Again!\" rather than \"You lose!\" This the most rude end that I have seen on any of these games.",
        "So far its good! Just wish you would not link all your games like you do it bogs the games down. And wish you would fix it so that if you had a game several years ago in which you used your email address you could reuse it even if you can't remember your password",
        "A different spin on the classic MahJong game. It's fast-paced  and sometimes it doesn't respond as quick as I  would like. I wish the game would allow just a little more time because it is difficult to see the different levels to find all the matching tiles.",
        "I love this game. However I do have problems with the loading. It says there is no internet connection which is not true. I have fast ADSL and it is connected all the time. Why don't I have problems with other games then? They all work perfectly. Please look into this matter. Thanking you.",
        "I paid 1.99 for 40 eggs and game earned the other 5... and the \"unique prize\" was 5 gems.... I would think it would be something a little more...idk just more. Other than that, the game is awesome. Love the whole idea. Levels, like any other of the \"saga\" games with mahjong."

        "It's very obvious the admin, the guy who owns the game, doesn't care about this game. There are absolutely no English mods, however they let other languages moderate the English section, And they can get pretty abusive. Specifically Xero, who recently, is banning people who simply don't agree with him, and they are lengthy bans. It's a disgrace.",
        "Mods abuse their power. EVERY SINGLE NEW REGION (& country) has 90+ turks in it and they only vote for Turks. theres no point in a worldwide political game when they dont even look beyond their own borders."

Seems everywhere you go there are bullies. And they take forever to do a server merge when you're server is dieing. But overall still a good Game. Also there needs to be a server merge for a few servers. Some of the servers are dieing and some players are quitting because there's nothing new and the targets are slim to none. And alot are written to Joy City and asked for a merger and get nothing. Something needs to be done",

When swiping it doesn't always read the swipe and kick it for a try through ball. When shooting the swipe isn't constant, I can swipe as fast as i can and it goes 54mph. Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue. Atm the game isn't going to be played much more because it gets frustrating when it isn't working right.",

The  game  itself  is boring and  even  if you  spend money you will  never  be able  to  catch  up  to other player's.  In fact  the game is designed  to take your  money  and provide a very poor  gaming  experience.  I do not  recommend  this Game to anyone, waste  of time and money. Never download  this game nor fun even if you spend  thousands  of dollars game  you never catch up to others",
        "I really love this game, I have played this since it got released. However I only gave it a 4 star for this reason: I beleive that its a game that you can play and enjoy without using real money to speed your upgrade. However, I recently reached the appropriate level for me to play the seal, crusade and getaway, and Its just so hard to beat. It requires me to upgrade my empire beyond the natural process. Meaning I need to buy buy buy with real money. Im so disappointed",
        "Alot of room for improvement, take ideas from people and don't reward them, played for two years not a single lvl 5 gem. Waste of time.. be better if there were more opportunities for people instead of the rich buying way to top.",
        "The game is very interesting and addicting. Would be nice to see some improvements and changes to the game as well. For example, sea stones are ridiculously hard to get. It would be much appreciated if you could actually farm them.",
        "I started playing this game almost 6 years ago but it has become such a waste of time. Unless you have no life, a job that you can be on your phone all day and an endless supply of money, do not play this game. It takes forever to upgrade gear unless you spend thousands of dollars. It also takes me about 30-45 minutes of playing just to do daily talks. Such a waste of time",
        "Why are you giving up on little empire? The game is so amazing. Please bring more things than just new armor. Also more events like the weapon pack which makes the 999 weapons cheap."

I love this game but when I had to get a new phone I had to start all over, so I didn't play for a long time. I just recently redownloaded it and it still doesn't have a save option. When are you going to change that? I play one of your other games and it has a save option. When are you going to give this game a save option because I have mentioned it before and nothing has changed. I want to keep playing but I would also like a Google play save option in case I have to get a new device.",
        "This is a great app. It has great graphics and doesnt make up anything from the actual show like other games do. My little sister is just crazy for this game. She even pursuaded her friends to get this game! Amazing game, no flaws. Definetly worth 5 stars!",
        "I like this game. But there's a bug. When I try to watch a video to play a mini game for free, the video freezes but the pop up ads don't freeze.... It doesn't make sense.  Why add pop up ads when we're already watching them for the free mini games.  At first I couldnt put this game down, I became addicted, but since the bug started to happen, I started to lose interest.",
        "I'm not sure what happened but my game reset. What also stinks is my game used to be glitchy when I'd leave the game a day later and come on, not even two seconds passed in the game. If highly suggest to stay on online mode since that seems like the only mode that keeps time",
        "This is bullcrap! This is the second time this game has all of a sudden stopped working and I cannot get back in to play. I am soo disappointed that you keep letting this happen!! I seriously could use some HELP!!! Please FIX this issuse immediately!!! I want to continue to play MLP... :'(",
        "I will give this game 5 stars if u can get some help.  When ever I try to open my inbox to look at my shards or collect the hearts I have been sent,  my game just crashes. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game,  playing offline,  clearing the cache data and almost everything else I can think of. Also when I try doing anything with twilight I can't do any tasks, plus I can't find twiligr either.  Please help me. I love this game. But I may stop because it keeps crashing"

        "This game needs a lot of improvements. The castle/home screen keeps pixelising or bugging out when I tab out of the game and back in, sometimes it does it on its own too. The picture also wobbles a bit while zooming in or out. I'd also improve the tapboxes since tapping on the sky takes me to the fortifications panel for some reason. The map also seems pretty dull. Apart from all that, the UI is simplistic and I like it. I just wish there were more things to do.",

I did the math someone attacked 2 of my forts but didn't have silver to claim them, so I didn't bother sending that much support (just trickled). Guess what the person was a pay to win and had sent rubies, I lost both my forts. That's why rubies are dumb."

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is glitchy, the story line is inconsitent, you have to always keep watching ads. On top of that you rehearse multiple times and it doesnt tell you have to get an a. I picked ballet and forced me to do hip hop for season 2. I tried to like it, but it's glitches before the dance perfomance how am I supposed to remeber the routine when i watch multiple ads and do routines that are not ment to be for the perfomance. Idk if its glitch ir a bug but it's just really bad. It is a cute game. Just not consistent."

        "Enjoyable and would have been 5 stars if not for the fact that you can't transfer your items between phones, even with Facebook save game syncing. So if you upgrade your phone, all the items you saved up are going to stay with your old phone. That's pretty maddening.",
        "Great game, but when I change devices, my power ups aren't there! This has happened twice now where I connected to my Facebook and then switched devices only to lose my boosters. This has made me lose over 100 boosters. It is a serious problem. I would not recommend investing in the game if the boosters just delete between devices. I have enjoyed playing it but that is a big problem.",

And you have to buy trending games or else you will lose subscribers you will also lose them if you don't make a video for a amount of time. You have to buy this game it is an impeccable game anyone can play the game and enjoy it",

I played this game for hours upon hours and while it saved all my achievements to my Play account, it clearly doesn't backup there because when I had an issue where I had to reset my phone, I lost my entire progress in the game. This is 2018 kids. This is unacceptable.",

I was able to touch the screen and hear the click noises but was stuck on loading screen. Fun game if issue could be sorted out. Please assist.",

The rewards for victory are so small it's almost impossible to upgrade your base unless of course you pay for a shield,but even that's a scam cause with a shield you can't atracvk enemy bases.  Everything is basically pay to upgrade or spend forever trying to save up and even then. Bottom line ftx games are a scam. A shame too I really liked the game at first. But once you start buying stuff for it, it keeps you in a position where you have to keep on paying to have a chance.",
        "Many time bought gold as soon you'll purchase gold the same time upgrades of building will increase by 20 bar of gold... I check twice before purchase was 100 bar for upgrade building as soon as I purchased went to 150 bar of gold ... the same building to upgrade... and rewards are like nothing ... used to loved it a lot but now seems to less liking it because of this..anyways game is awesome but need to invest a bit if you need survive out there in cartel",
        "Great fun",
        "Waste of time and money. You watch adds for a speed up, nothing happen, you install other apps for gold, nothing happen, you submit a report to customer service,nothing happen, they send back problem solved and they didn't do anything about. I bought gold for the app from one of their sponsors, nothing happen. I report it , a girl named Daria sent me back a email and said problem solved, guess what...NOTHING HAPPENED",
        "Total rip off dont waste your time or money. Ever since update..its horrible. The developers will swipe your gold away (basically your money) and give an excuse that your bank or Google issued a refund. After showing and providing evidence that your never received a refund...they do nothing about it! Straight run around. And good luck talking to support..generic responses like the one they give on here.",
        "This was the best Game i ve ever played but every new update creates alot trouble and tension of users. Forta spoiled the games fun. Now they want people to spemd money on scorpion. When they make them. They will introduce a sicario for that too... really dissapointed with tge way you people robbing money ftx."

        "Overall great game as far as playing is concerned. Major thing that could use work is matchmaking. Currently an 89 overall getting matched against 98-105 overall players. No chance to win and may discourage some people from playing the game. The gameplay is awesome and I have lots of fun, 100% worth your time if you avoid Head-to-head or tournaments (unless you have money or don't mind being poorly matched).",
        "This is my full honest review. Madden Mobile is back!! I'll admit before it was not fun and I complained that you need to pay to win but EA really did good when I came back to play. The game is fun and is somewhat easy to get 100 overall players and now they are bringing back Draft Champs and I have seen early drafts and it looks great. The promos are great. I would like to say great job EA on bringing this game back and making it fun. I always want to play everyday and build my Ultimate Team",
        "I have played this game for 3 seasons now.  I can't even begin to say all that is wrong, but one of the things that stands out most to me, is that your players stats mean nothing.  You spend a lot of time and effort completing events and grinding, and improve your team only to find out that when you play a team way below your level, it seems that that teams players are much faster and tend to play way above their ability.  this game seems to have the liberal bug that everyone is equal.  I am done with this game, don't get caught up with it, it's not worth the waste of your time",
        "Thanks alot EA for this new head to head style. Great to know that all the grinding and work put in is only allowing those who have a 100 overall or better reap the rewards. Everytime playing one of these individuals they have a counter for every single play. This really turns me off to the game.",
        "For the person hoping to find Madden 18, this is the closest thing you are gonna get. Yes, it doesn't have practice mode or my player mode, but it DOES have a incredible roster of players that you bargain for. The graphics are pretty good for a game on a smartphone.  Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE for NFL fans. 10 outta 10.",
        "You know I really like all of the Live Events but when I get these old collectible cards that aren't worth anything I have to cut them one by one. It takes way too long and I've got over a hundred. I would suggest having a way to group delete or in Madden terms \"cut\" the old dead weight."

This app has great opportunity to be the greatest boxing app. Thanks and good luck",

More things to do for random rewards like something that takes an alloted amount of time to do and it costs gold or whatever and uses builders to finish.",
        "So I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 3 due to the fact I noticed that to upgrade the gold mine from lvl5 to 6 it takes 4 hours and from lvl 6-7 it takes a FULL DAY. Other then that pretty fun game. Just some rediculously long wait times on certain things.",
        "Wicked game! Been playing for a while now.  Loads to do! Although the layout seems a little confusing and over the place. But in saying that the game has good graphics, story and characters. My only issues are, the price of things and how long it takes to upgrade things the more you progress through the game amd of course the confusing layout but that's due to so much content.",
        "This is a great game. It's not over complicated and very simple to understand everything. It is much better any other of those clash of clans type of games. The only thing I find difficult is getting the resources to level up skills early on in the game also early on in the game it's really hard to raid when skills cost 3.5 rage when I can level it up to reduce the cost. Other than that this game is very awesome. I rate it 4* all around because \"nothing is perfect\".",
        "This game forces you to buy gems just to progress your hero's. It's too much. They rarely give you anythong in the other options to get what you need for your hero's. Also they only take gems for certain upgrades. This is a joke and shows how greedy these developers are. Not worth a dime.",
        "This game is a complete ripoff. Content is beyond boring. They update the game MAYBE 1 per month. There's bugs that don't get fixed and the only new content you should ever expect to see is content that costs real $. Awful game. Do not waste your time."

        "Good graphics. Good units. Awesome skills. Nice drawings. All in all, this is a really good game 😁👍👌But I have a problem. It keeps stopping everytime I open it. And I've also been addicted to this game for more than a month now 😄",
        "It's been a year since I've last played this, still fun. I've been playing this from day to night as far as I could remember. Hopefully, the bugs where the downloading restarts are solved. Nice Gameply as ever, getting hooked to this once again.",
        "This game is fun and addictive. I like that you don't have to work very hard to get decent leveled characters, and having everyone be overpowered makes the game fun. My only problem is how multiplayer is a little wonky sometimes, mainly when the app suddenly freezes during a battle.",
        "Feels satisfying and stress-free , cute characters too. I just have one problem, when it gives me a notifications of free polygons or similar to that, I go check but I don't get anything. There appears nothing in my giftbox.",
        "Great graphics and music and very f2p friendly for a gachapon game. Lots of banners with guaranteed top tier units so if you follow the Discord or Reddit community's advice on when to pull, you can make the free gems go a long way. The more characters you have, the more quests you can do to get more characters, so it may seem slow in the beginning but eventually your character collection will snowball until you have more waifus than you know what to do with!"

You guys always claim how much you appreciate your players, why not show your appreciation by increasing the number of spins a player can win from 5 to 8, 8 to 10 and so on. Now that would be a great update  (without making it more difficult to win free spins) that all players would appreciate & it will make your game more fun to play. Knew U wouldn't respond.",

        "Great balance between encouraging players to support the game through purchasing gold AND rewarding them for playing.  Plenty of attention is given to players who do not want to spend real money,  as you can make 5-10$ equivalent in gold per day watching ads and playing the game, not to mention the free chests you get a few times/day. The offers from the chests only ask for 5$, a very fair price for the goodies you receive.   The buildings and landscapes are beautiful and detailed. There is a wide selection of buildings and the cities really come to life.  This is a great game to relax when you have a few minutes of downtime, I'm dont play many city builders but this is one of the best.",

Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",

Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",

        "It would be nice to find a better way for allies to communicate via voice chat. Communication is key to victory and should be given to those who earn it and are serious about the game and want to become the Elite. Overall a great game even after 3+ years of gameplay. You will make tons of friends here so join already ;-)",
        "After newest update, can no longer play on an S8 plus because most of the controls are off screen and can not adjust it to be non full screen mode anymore",
        "Good game but needs a fair play policy players level 80 are attacking players  at really low levels not giving them a chance to build up.",
        "Plarium do not like Aussies. They charge us extra money for offers.   A top end offer is $100 USD for the Americans. Which is $120-125 AUD after currency conversion for Australians. Yet for some reason our offers are $160 AUD. $35 AUD more then we should be paying.   I do not know how this practice has gone without incident as I thought there were supposed to be good anti descrimination laws and consumer laws in place that prevent the charging of extra to countries just because they do not like that country.   This is a morally disgusting practice as it is the same concept as charging more to others purely on the basis because they have a different skin colour, gender or religion.   I want to know why Australians are paying an extra $35 AUD then we should be as other mobile games. One example being Battle Mobile do the correct currency exchange rate and only charge $125 AUD after conversion from $100 USD. If other mobile games do it correctly why are Plarium choosing not to?  Edit: @ Plarium employee who just lied in response to me. Plarium set all prices up themselves through Google Playstore. NOT Google.",

        "This is an updated version. My last post was from I think September or maybe October, but this game is truly AMAZING!!! The story line itself is great as well as the side story's that you can read as well. This game has changed so much from when I started playing this game in August. The events are great but I think the developers can give a little bit better rewards then just XP juice and more jewels as well as heart stamina, but other than that the game is perfect no glitches and non of that stuff. The one year anniversary was amazing thank you for that!! I can't wait for season 10 and the future seasons of Moe Ninja Girls!!!",
        "There really isn't anything negative to say about \"Moe! Ninja Girls\" the story is great, every character is deep and likeable, even if you're a free player each chapter is long enough to keep you coming back and paying is definitely worth it,too. It looks great and sounds great to boot. I honestly don't like mobile games at all but this is amazing and would be even it were a console or pc game. To me this is THE perfect app on mobile so download it now! And devs: I hope you continue to support the game because if you guys keep making seasons,I'll keep playing. Love you guys! &lt;3",
        "The story is really the best part of the whole game. The ninja fighting seems to be arbitrary , as you can have high stats and still lose a match. Collecting new gear is fun but you don't get as much new gear as you would like. Sometimes the game stretches the abilities of my Amazon fire eight and crashes under Google Play add in. This story definitely makes it worthwhile playing though it's funny and titillating!  ;-)",
        "Amazing story! Great characters. Other similar apps dont compare. Im playing completely free so far, just finished Season 1, and many awesome event stories. Well worth my time. Yes you have to wait 4 hours between chapters, but who cares. Its actually a nice pace.",
        "Cute anime girls. Only things is that the gameplay was really simple. I've played some dating games before and usually there's more options or they appear more frequently. And the ninja fight mini game was also simple. I don't know. This game seems to get good reviews so maybe it's just me.",
        "The game's quite sensational! You wouldn't believe how hooked I am to this game when I finally found it then played it. The story is quite good, the cast are very unique. All in all, a great game. Oh, it would be nice to add some mini-games that allow players to gain nineys/gems other than the ninja fights. Also, there were some hick-ups with some of the dialogues where the words don't make sense but it's still readable."

        "Incredible mobile game, even for older gamers! Incredible mobile game, one of the first fully realized AAA titles on Android.  No stupid IAP, micro-transactions or paywalls after initial purchase.  Vast, procedurally-generated worlds with numerous biomes and biome-specific items, bosses and events, making for great replayability.  A deep, relaxing game of crafting and building OR a PVE game OR multiplayer. Even has a great tutorial and cloud save to sync across devices.  Playing on Nexus 6p and I have no problems with controls, even as an older gamer.",
        "Hey,  so this is gonna longish review... what I have to say about this is while  it is similar to Minecraft in the way that it is open world it is a completely different game. It has the graphics of your old 16 bit Dungeon Crawler games in a huge and immersive environment that is always changing. As a PC player of the game I can say that I am pleased with the port over onto mobile devices. I wouldn't ask for anything different!",
        "PLEASE Fix it. First I Love this game, only I can't access the game online. No cloud saves, no multiplayer, I got this to play with my son and so my kids can play together. Would love to give the app full star's, please fix this so that I can. All that asides its still a lot of fun, still recommend this highly. Just got to update what I said, now I can't even access the game. All the gear that I've made/found is gone if I have to reinstall. If I didn't like the game I wouldn't mind but I do, so it's only disappointed me more. PLEASE fix this so that I can play this awesome game with my son before I fined another great game we can play together on our phones. Maybe I'll start with that minecraft game he's going on about.......",
        "Great game, and enjoyable by whole family on local multiplayer. Terraria PE has come a long way since its early days. Waiting for new updates. The only issue I've seen is that for some reason 360 Security flags this as a trojan malware possibly due to so many access permissions that Terraria asks for. Devs this is something you may want to clear with them. Otherwise keep up the good work.",
        "I LOVE the game but you need more bosses And wepons that you can forge together to get unique wepons and armor (like say you want the special effect from one armor set but you want the def fom another you could forge then together and get the special effect and the def). You also might want to add a extremely hard boss like duke fishron, but lots of them! It would add so much play time onto the game, but you would like i said earlier new armor add tools.",
        "I've played this game since elementary school till now, I'm still fall in love playing this game. Even though sometimes it gets salty when you lose something or the bug, but... Idfc =D. For the devs, could you add more stuff from PC to this mobile version ? It'll be cool to have chimney and other good looking decorations for the house"

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "This rpg is best so far.. I've tried many rpgs like avabel,  toram etc.. This is the best so far...with great controls.. i love it.. But it would have been better if we can fully inspect other players... Also PVP for pvp players coz most of the rpg players are up for pvp instead of pve.. I hope u'll fix it. :) sorry for my bad english lol.. And this is the first time i wrote a review XD.. Love this game..",
        "Amazing game, loads of fun. if I could just control it better. this game is great! it's got really good graphics and it's an acceptable MMORPG. especially for on-the-go, in your hands, and your phone, it's great. however the controls are really rough, I can't really move and turn my camera at the same time; and that is what really gets me. it takes me out of the game when my camera doesn't work well with trying to attack and move my camera and trying to move and jump at the same time.",
        "Yea this game is awesomeness!!.  I've been playing for about two months and unfortunately it's already getting repetitive. All the running around without mounts is boring and I think you desperately need to introduce dungeons and a solid PVP system.  I'm really liking the characters, graphics and the controls are out of this world awesome. The man quest is fun but the side quest need some work. Thx guys and Please please, considering adding to the game.",
        "OK been playing for a week now & can rate this a 5* all them way! Graphics are awesome, story is cool. Run's smooth on my tablet. The download was huge but worth it in all the bonuses they give you after, wow! When I hit B.W.T. and said I need to download more I sighed loudly haha. Then got the bonus stuff and the game is just cool. Pat yourselves on the back nice job!!!",
        "Asobimo strikes again! Combined from the unreal engine graphic and asobimo's creativity, this game really gives what its promise. The graphic is amazing, the gameplay is addicting and story is interesting. Unlike the others MMORPG in the play store in which almost every game have exactly same gameplay with only the UI and Characters that make them different.. the tittle as well lol This game is far different from those \"crappy\" games. Worth a try and worth your time. the size of the game is kinda huge tho it means the game has quality!",
        "This game was awesome, though the download was lengthy. I would love to give a better rating, but after I reach chapter two the game stops. I can't get it past the part where I pick which character I want to play. Overall, when they fix this, It will be awesome! I was actually able to choose everything for my character, attributes, looks, etc. The only thing I have wished so far is that there were different races to choose from as well. If they did that, this would overall be the best game I've ever played, from game consoles and all."

New & old player can snatch 1 SSR player but this new event though why you make it more depressing feature ? i figure playing this game is like working to get money.... i thought this game suppose to be fun and bring childhood memories, i know you need effort to get gold ticket but this \"effort\" is all based on luck already see many people day 1 got 0 gold ticket day 2 got 5 gold ticket...... just how? seriously if u want to make new event at least make it friendly for user i dont see point to play this game all night long to get that rewards your just making people to stay aeay from your game not attracting them shame event",
        "the game is just awsome but it has many cracks. the problem now is that matches don't start they keep loading forever this all happens when the photos in the missions menu appear white space. i don't even know the reason behind it ! i would rate the app 5 stars if it got fixed.  everytime this happens i have to reinstall the app",
        "Remind me of childhood anime.. Good game but have some minor bugs as far as I played.. Should be add ability to substitute players in middle of match, not only when half time rest.. Maybe some dribble or combination attack skill should be used to pass multiple players and get our player closer to the keeper. Please add more story match. Also fix regular online match, it's always freeze.",

Even if it was massively  over priced. Would be even better if you could save load outs for weapons and perks.",

Also improve tha game's matchmaking skills",

So, to publisher is not enough income of adds on game worth of 2$, but have in-game purchace worth of HUNDRED of dollars. Really? On a casual kid's game? Greed to infinity and beyond.",

        "Great Game and concept and all... But the multiplayer is so offballanced. I'm only like level 3 and yet I keep getting people who are at least level 80. Also the new zombie hero (Huge-Giganticus) needs to be nerfed as soon as possible. Lastly, whoever makes the daily challenges needs to stop, they are practically impossible to beat and the reward isn't that great.",

Moreover, players who had issues about the internet connectivity problems of while they're watching an ad and letting your opponent to win in multiplayer. Not only that but the Super Block Meter is keeping a lot buggy. Fix these problems now."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks.",
        "This game will cheat you! I  upgraded a bunch of my characters but the next time I logged in nothing had saved! The funds I used to upgrade were also gone, of course. Don't waste money buying anything because the upgrades you make just disappear."

        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!",
        "Could be better. It is a great game. Could use different music as it's literally same as the penguin race game. It also contains false advertising. It says, 'Buy anything and get rid of ads for free'. This is not the case when pressed on. You have to pay £0.78. Sort out your English.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "I played this back in high school and thought you know I wanna play it again, it was my favorite. , VIP access? Are you f***ing kidding me? I will never play this again, you ruined the best game out there for what? 20 dollars a month? For one that's more expensive than xbox live is. And 2 that is just selfish. Its an app, you guys had it right the first time."

        "Brings Back Fond Memories I love this game! I spent countless hours playing this in the early 2000s. The controls are easy enough to understand and the text is legible on my LG V10. I don't if I'd be able to read it on a smaller screen, they are not kidding when they say this is meant for tablets. If you've got a tablet or phablet I can't recommend this game enough.",
        "A classic perfectly adapted to the phone platform This game is a MUST-have for any rpg lover. The D&D mechanics may seem i bit weird in the beginning, but you will learn in time. The replayability value of this game is almost infinite. Personally I have never played any kind of game that would allow me to play as many hours in so many different ways. The game excels in its easy to handle mechanics, fun dialogue, compelling story, great ammount of side-quests that are actually enjoyable. Hands down best Apk for this platform. Worth every penny.",
        "Great Classic CRPG BGII was definitely a breakthrough in its time, but it still holds charm and depth that many newer games can't even touch. I have this game for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and I can tell the chip set on the phone is grinding gears with the games engine. It's playable but only when the right character menu is minimized but it still gets choppy when multiple spells are being  cast. With the specs on the s7 this shouldn't be the case. Hey Developers any input/ advice on how to solve this issue?",
        "Amazing! There's a lot to love.  First, if you played the original, this is just as good with extras.  Granted, it's a bit harder to see everything, but it's what happens when you take a computer game and make it available for a phone.  Beamdog has brought additional characters, adventures, magic items, portraits and voices to the game to expand the character creation.  Some expansions are dull (like the arena unless you love grinding) but more of this rpg is on the way.  It's truly the best classic game reborn.",
        "I have a special request. I have purchased very possible version of the bg series, and have played as long as the game has existed. Call me a war vet asking for a wheel chair ramp but could you guys implement the imput of  points or the option to roll. 20+ years of rolling for stats has earnt me the option. Other than that perfect game, worth every licence for every platform. Either let us input stats with option to roll or make a shadowkeeper for android please.",
        "Game is great, as I've played it on another device. However on Note 8 it does not take up the whole screen, and the usable screen is significantly smaller than on s7 edge, and is barely playable. When I force it to full screen in settings, then touching on sides of screen are not recorded accurately. For example, when I try to resize the text box, it toggles AI instead. Makes the game virtually unpayable."

        "I love playing this game. But please fix the way cards are displayed. Make the full screen view of the card actually full screen. I want to be able to see the Dark Magician's eyes clearly. Duel links is better at this than you. Also I don't get why I can't get rid of cards I don't need. I can only use 3 of the same card in a deck. So why allow the accumulation of more than that? It's a waste. Again duel links does this better.",
        "This game is very fun, but only when it's actually able to load. Over half the time I want to play, the game won't load at all and is just a black screen. I'm getting REALLY tired of the non-loading, but I can't delete it because it really is a fun and interesting game. I'm hoping the loading issue is resolved in an update or something because it's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel! Lol",
        "Cards are well presented in this game, and it's easy to read the effects. Graphics are done well. The problem I have though is the controls. The buttons are very small and make the game a lot easier if the table scrolled. It's not that big of a deal I could be changed later. Other than that, it's a good game and it brings me back to the days when I used to play Yu-Gi-Oh in high school. If you like card games I definitely recommend it.  Forgot to mention one more problem with the game. Sometimes it will prom",
        "This game on the note 8 isn't working. The buttons by the edges aren't responding and the overall touch responses are very unresponsive. I don't have a screen protector on, I was playing this game in both full screen and regular size, and I even tried to use my S Pen; no response on several buttons, especially in deck editor. Please fix this asap.",
        "Well... All my friends tell me that this is way better that duel links so I tried it out... I would say that links is better because of one thing, they have better game layout. If u make the game better with multiplayer like links and card layout like links then this GAME will be over the charts!! Can u make quests and other thing. Al im saying make it a bit more like links from layout to gameplay. But all in all it is a bit better than LINKS! Oh and another thing add trading ect",
        "I used to play the game all the time and it worked perfectly fine. There are times it gets slow while loading because there are some not needed graphical effects which don't have an option to disable bit otherwise it usually works. I stopped playing for a while when I got a new phone and now when I try to log into my account it does not work. I tried to use the forgot password button and it gives me a temporary password in my email but it does not work when trying to log in. I would love to be able to get my account back, I put a lot of time into it."

        "Great game! The only thing I can think of to make it better would be to have a google+ login. Some of us prefer not to bind to FB. But, all in all, great. Edit: cannot get daily login rewards \"abnormal time setting\" my date and time are consistent with where I live and I have not altered them in any way. (Auto set) Still no other way to bind account except Facebook. This will eventually get you a lower rating from me.",
        "At first looks simple and can just auto everything, but you'll eventually reach a point where strategy has a truly major impact on gameplay. Really well-made, only complaint is Gem Card gem bonus should be in Mail, not Daily Task, so busy people can maintain their purchases. Edit: Also the potions used should not be deducted if disconnected in middle of battle. Kinda expensive to keep restocking certain potions.",
        "The game is good... but 100k download is suck atatistic for a 2 year old game.... u guys need new user base... dont u guys advertise in google network ads or adwords at least.... even brave frontier got 10 mil download from playstore",
        "i think this game is so great.the story line,the grapichs,the gameplay,everythink is great. except one: LOGIN!! why must use FB account??? why not google account or use ur own system???.who was play this game too but he's login use guest account cause he doesn't FB account,and when te app update he loss his all data in his account.he was level30 squad when that.he very disappointing and stop play this game again.now just me who play this game until now",
        "As a f2p gamer i find this game quiet balanced. Not too overpowering privileges for cashiers makes it an enjoyable game. Been playing for 2 years. One thing that concern me is that i wish there are chat notification 'cuz i find it hard to communicate with my guildmates. And also there is the combat system which is a piece of shit actually because i have a warrior squad with 6.2k power just lost in the job change level 6 with 5.5k squad power which is frustrating considering the big power gap. Please reduce the difficulty in accordance of the recommended squad power and maybe i will have a better opinion on this game"

        "Tactical monsters is a great turn based strategy game. There's enough complexity to make it interesting but not so much that it's overwhelming. It has both single and multiplayer game mode options as well as fun challenges. Collecting cards is addicting and fun. Warning, it makes you want to play  more! One of my favorite things game is how fast it is. Battles are quick but still enjoyable. It is possible to do well in this game without paying. One last thing I like about this game is the support. The developers are constantly updating the game and fixing issues.",
        "Great game, but after the last update the game isn't stable, when you play pvp often the timer freezes and you can't do anything beside closing the game, or you just cant do any action, and then you miss your turn, please fix it, and I'll give it 5 stars because the game is really awesome. Problem solved!",
        "i uninstalled the game but i made sure to bound my account to googleplay however when i installed the game again i cant get my previous progress and have to start over again please fix this.... Overall the game is really good for people who like to play strategically.",
        "For a game called tactical monsters, I was unpleasantly surprised that most units are actually humans and not monsters. Fighting is very basic with only having melee and ranged arrows. No magic, no way to buff allies, not many choices in combat. Overall a very boring and lackluster tactics wanna be type game. Hexes for movement are also very small and no back button to take back moves. I would not recommend playing this on a phone at all- Reply to Camex Games: First, try using spell check next time. Second - I did play several missions past the \"tutorial\" and none of the units given had magic or skills that opened up the game past a hack n slash. Third - Its not my problem to play dozens of hours in your mediocre phone game waiting for it to get interesting. If your game isn't good within the first hour, no one wants to keep playing for the next 10 hours. Fourth - how many monsters you have hidden in the game is irrelevant, as the units you get at the beginning of the game are mostly human, in a game called Tactical MONSTERS. Fifth - Giving monsters 3 basic skills that don't offer much tactical option when you can't customize them, isn't interesting. Sixth -- Add a back button",
        "Game is awesome! One of the best tactics game I ever played, and I play those a lot. Would be a great implement if we could zoom in or out during battle, and also some little story on campaign would make it more enjoyable. 4.9*",
        "I can't open game it go on 100 and then say network problem so fix it my all friend are playing this game and reach much higher and my game is not starting 😢😢 plz plz plz fix it for me if no then sorry I had to uninstall it"

        "I love this game. Reminds me of the old GTA games. Sandreas, Vice City Stories, Liberty City Stories,  you know. Controls are a little diffucult but if you have a OTG cable and a controller, it makes the controls a whole lot bearable. Besides the little difficult controls, graphics are great, games runs smooth, voices in the game are amazing, and this mobile verson of Vice City is just amazing! I am really enjoying it so far. Definitely worth the $7 and the 1.5GB of space. Thank you Rockstar Games for making this mobile version of Vice City, and for android too!",
        "Well worth $5 Great story line,  interesting characters,  lots of missions,  ive only played gta san andreas on pc, before,  but i may actually like this one even better. Using samsung galaxy TAB S, just one request. The car driving experience does not reflect in real time, in respond to my steering.  Hard enough to complete driving missions,  this makes it almost impossible. Love it other wise. Thanks in advance.",
        "I think the game is great but there are no missions available after a certain point.  There's no real stopping point it just ran out of missions.  Part of the whole reason to play gta is for the story.  I'm still waiting for Tommy to take on the people that he used to work for now that he has all this money and power.  And what happened to Lance?  Like, the story just stopped.",
        "Fun All these kids reviewing this game low. . This game is old and they aren't going to go in an edit anything. Its not made for a controller if u want to use a controller buy it on a console. If u don't have enough space on your device that's your fault for not reading the description. If its not working on your device email them they can help u out or give u a refund. They will never have gta5 on mobile it be like 10gb maybe more and drain ur battery in 1 minute.",
        "A- but loved it! Def better graphics than GTA III. Might have to tweak the display settings of you plan on using in different devices. Not all work flawlessly with high graphics. I wish there was a cloud setting or something to switch my saved info on to another device. Never the less this is still a classic as well and very happy with it! Lookong forward to get San Andreas!",
        "Cant re-download I have downloaded this game before and while clearing out my phone space I accidentally un installed it, so when I tried to re install it after. it wont re install it says error so if you can help I will insantly give 5 stars because ir if a fun game to play. Error occured on samsung s4 mini. Got reply instantly by email 5 stars for you rockstar ☺😊🙋🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

        "To the guy that says stop bitching cuz it's free. Reviews are so they can get feedback to improve the game. What good is the game if you can only play 2 games a day? There are too many other games out there that are free that customers can get chips to play for hours. This game should take care of their loyal customers before they move on to some of the other games. So many have posted about the small amount of chips received and they added the spinning wheel, maybe by reading the reviews they are listening and trying to improve chances of getting more chips. If everyone continues to give low reviews, maybe just maybe they'll increase our chances to get more daily chips!",
        "Purchased 90 rockets pack. Explained to me how I used all 90 in one game? Smh, that's too much.. So y'all want ppl to purchase rockets each hand. Y'all can do better. Chip packages as well. Maybe u will get more to contribute to the game. Smh, better chip packages probably will definitely help this game. Especially the price of chips to play verses what the rooms payout... Really is at a disadvantage to players to even purchase.",
        "I usually love this game. However, today I decided to treat myself and purchase some chips to get the last two battle ships that I needed to get 800 chips. The game is so frigging rigged it's just sad. It took all 600 chips that I bought and all that I won trying to accomplish a goal.  I will NEVER purchase chips again, especially in this game.",
        "Most of my purchases lately have been strange disappearing chips and rockets i have spent SO much  money on this game!!! and another thing i could not access any games for 2 days now but it TOOK ALL MY CHIPS AGAIN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU IN REGARDS TO THIS.",
        "Good variety of games. Not many free chips once the first few rounds are played when compared to what the rounds cost. Be ready to buy, buy, buy if you aren't patient. They have added many more chances for free chips. Thank you guys.",
        "I love the game again.  I'd been struggling with glitches and now they're fixed  I'm especially loving the free chips you give sometimes daily!  I've become re-addicted to it!  The new format IS easier to see, but it gets slightly boring when the two cards you CAN daub don't get any numbers!  It looks as if you're phasing out the gems, which is fine with me; I'd rather have all free daubs, chips, and only a FEW coin power plays.  The free daubs make all the difference between winning and losing.  Also, would like to see winning bingos actually give me the items I need to complete rooms and for you to increase the daily chips for every completed room."

The new Legend, Level 13, mission 3, \"Impassable!\". By the time you have passed the top half of the mission,  you don't gave enough goes to beat the level,  like I say, impassable which makes it impossible. Con!",
        "I am absolutely addicted to this game! It is by far my absolute favorite game on my phone EVER, hands down!!!   I'm always so excited when my energy is refilled. I'd play it all day if I could! ❤❤❤ this game!  Getting to new levels is always so exciting and it's challenging in a fun way. If you love puzzles or beating a witch that's trying to stop you, then this is the game for you!!  Thank you for this game! I recommend it to everyone!! 😅😆😆😃",
        "I really enjoy this game.  I play just before going to bed just to clear my thoughts of the day.  I play when I'm standing in line waiting on a purposely slow person as not to snap off. It's a good game for me.  I can give it 4⭐, an increase from previous rating.  8/13/17 Just about 2 years later from last rating. I'm still playing.  10/11/17: I continue to play this game with the added annoyance of the interactive advertisement.  I am to the point that i will purchase this game for a small fee (.99) just to get rid of the interactive advertisement.  Interactive advertisements are there but it's not a requred interaction.  They have added a timer.  Great job.",

        "Now a days while playing the game closes and a life is also lost. New levels should be added weekly instead of monthly.In spin the wheel many times the reward are not added. Pls fix the problem immediately of game closing and spin the wheel.",
        "The game is fun but it cheats way 2 much! I should have beat a level again and it made me lose. I'm almost to the point of deleting it. I was in level 195 with 1 move left 2 beat the witch. I only needed 3 and made a 5 move play and I lost again. This is about the 10th time I've lost due to this game cheating. I haven't deleted yet because I like it but if it cheats again I'm deleting it like the other games that cheat. Today 2/15/18 the game is still cheating. I watched 3 vids and it said I didn't watch until the end. Ugh this game is fun but I'm ready to say forget itttttttt bc I keep complaining and new issues keep arising and they aren't even responding."

Also cant wait to ride my bike when i get to that part. and great fun on the sk8t board and really is a joy controller support as well. thanks Rockstar GAMES for cool bmx bikes ! it would be nice idea to be able to customize bikes and skate boards we could only dream. thanks for all the effort that was put forth in this Rockstar title. some of the oldschool best.",
        "I thought it was going to be hard to manage this game with the touch controls etc but NO totally wrong, it's super easy as they've reworked them for IOS and Android and you can also customise them too, plus the game still looks great even after so many years. The only place I can say where it loses on performance for some weird reason(patch maybe?)is when you enter a bathroom(lol)but who the hell stays in the bathroom for the whole experience haha. I definitely recommend buying if your a fan of the game!",
        "A great port of a fantastic PS2 game with amazing graphics for a phone.  I play on the Galaxy S5 which is a pretty old phone and I only have to deal with small frame rate drops in high population areas in game. Other than that, the game is the same, amazing game I grew up playing on the PS2 and Wii. I would recommend buying the game.  ONE PROBLEM: I recently received a phone upgrade and went from using a Galaxy S5 to a Galaxy J7 and for whatever reason I can't play the game on a newer phone. Pretty strange to say the least.",
        "yes, the controls can be annoying at times but nothing a Moga gaming controller can't fix!! makes the gaming experience a WHOLE LOT BETTER!! Love this game cus it's a ps2 classic always loved it!! ALWAYS WILL! just wish they made a 2nd one to this plus it works great on my razor phone sadly couldn't play it on my axon 7 due to the axon being a 6.1 software.",
        "FFS Rockstar, Works great with my Shield Tablet K1 but won't even install on my Shield TV 2015 because you guys marked it incompatible despite allowing it on the STV 2017? They're the exact same device? It works perfectly once side loaded as well. Please whitelist the Shield TV 2015 R*, Nvidia have confirmed its your issue so please fix it asap.",
        "When it comes down to mobile games, I could never really choose what games to download. The moment I saw this game on the Google Play Store, I lost my mind due to the fact that Bully is by far my favorite Rockstar Video Game! I've played it on Xbox and now on the Mobile addition and man, I got to say that Rockstar did an amazing job with the updated graphics! The game play is amazing as always and the controls are very easy to manage! The game never lagged out on me not once, and I've got to play it on my new Galaxy S8. I recommend this game if you're looking for a great story line and free roam experience. The map is decent in size and you get to beat people up all The time lol!"

        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "Good game but......after a day into it you make no coin. After every level upgrade it pushes the (buy) equipment option. Not to mention every time you level up. You got to.exit out 15 boxes.before you can continue. Good game but, it's a failure on the free to play aspect.  My rating is fair and final. It's a (ok)  game but many better ones out thwre",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",
        "Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s"

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance",
        "It's a great game where you can race and customise your own car. However here are some ideas I would like you the imlament please  1. If the cars from the NASCAR can get the custmizeing like all the others.   2. To extend the custmize can yo add a tab where you can put spoilers, air intakes And other things you would put on a car.  3. Finally to make this game real racing 3 if when a race of just go to see all the car you have.  There be a \"i\" button that will give the player real information about the car the player is looking at."
