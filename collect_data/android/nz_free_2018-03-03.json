     [ 'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.',
       'This game is have potential, don\'t ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What\'s the point of "playing" in this game?',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.' ],

Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless',

Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message "go online for more episodes" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'U want 5***\'s, well hard is ridiculously too hard, it has impossible levels that  you only win,  when king wants you to, this is so utterly ridiculous! Really makes me want to uninstall the game. I will give it another try, I\'m waiting for the game to divvy out more tries.. I mean 35 tries is stingy for a hard level, how about 45 tries instead?',
       'I\'m a addict when it comes to all the candy crushes I\'m currently on level 1060 (a really hard level) and I\'m  upset cause I get almost threw with that level and the app just close very upset fix the glitch please.. Other then that like I love candy crush but it still get 4 stars!',

I know I logged in yesterday and didn\'t miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you\'ve earned.',

I hate to Uninstall being I\'m at level 727 & Hitting the (X) does nothing but frustrates me & I\'m just about to delete. 😠 Please change some how some way.',
       'One of my favorite games, but after the most recent update, just like most of the reviews in the last several days, I\'m stuck at 705. I should be at 1153.

     [ 'Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It\'s not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please',
       'Love this game! The only part I don\'t like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won\'t buy any diamonds. I\'ll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.',
       'I like the game but waiting three hours for two passes is terrible.  And we have no other option to get free passes it is either wait or pay. I feel like I\'d we got more than two passes I would be okay with the wait. But waiting three hours knowing I am going to use those two tickets in less than a half hour is crazy.  Then I will lose interest in the story and forget what had happen, it isn\'t okay. But other than the wait for passes I really like this game.',
       'I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don\'t mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don\'t have then you should find a different app.',
       'Great app, just too many of the same type "romance" stories over and over again. It feels like only one person is writing stories on here, when It claims to have over 55,000 different stories. Each time i try to search for a new book to read a new, the same twelve pop up over and over. Fix that please. I very much enjoy supporting community made books but it seems like it\'s just a popularity contest on here, with the same story line and plots being used far too much.',
       'I love the idea of this game. But think it\'s absolutely stupid that everything costs so much gems and it ruins the whole game. You can pick any food choice bc you need 20 if not more gems and it happens so often. Would not reccomd this game TO ANYONE' ],

There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars.

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'You can earn a Max amount of 7 chalices at one time, and it takes a long time to re-accumulate chalices (some levels require the max amount of chalices in order to play level), and do not like the timed levels at all. I am on one now, and don\'t even want to play it, as I have run out of time, and it uses chalices up each time I play, and lose. Please remove these, liked the game a lot more before the timed levels were added. Otherwise, love the game.',
       'Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.',
       '2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove "pay to open" boxes or they don\'t go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low.' ],

     [ 'Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.',
       'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'It\'s been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there\'s no rhythm at all. Why don\'t you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it\'s only getting worse..',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.' ],

And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',

It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',

     [ 'Slotomania is hands down the best fb has to offer.  The tournaments are some of the most challenging I have played.  They appreciate fans and the time they spend here.  The developer\'s must be building their apps with personal touches.  I get the sense of one on one attention during play and think to myself...No it\'s an app silly!  Of course it shows best in the generous bonuses and free chips.  This game is BIG fun.  I am sure Slotomania will continue to thrill all who play here!!',
       'Don\'t know how you ever going to collect all the sloto cards cause they don\'t come out. Free spins on the ace game I virtually non existent just about ready to remove the app',
       'It has great pay outs but the only negative thing is it takes all your winnings plus some for instance I had over 300 billion coins and I\'m down to 500000 haven\'t won since',
       'It\'s addictive but it\'s to hard to win money you have to keep buying it BECOUSE you lose it all in your spins. It\'s fun playing but it\'s hard when you lose it all rite away.',

     [ 'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential',
       'Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don\'t mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉',
       'Best game EVER!! I love this game sooo much! The only problem is that you don\'t get to move on to the next level fast enough. I do hate that so much.And also e everything costs diamonds and u don\'t get alot of that.  But other than that, good game!! Highly recommended.',
       'In the beginning, I absolutely loved this game, but now, I do admit that it get\'s a bit boring and frustrating after a while because getting cash and diamonds without paying real money is incredibly difficult and time consuming. I do like that they fixed the reaction time for voting because it used to be sooo slow. But overall, I highly recommend this game for any kind of fashion lover who is willing to have the patience to play it.' ],

     [ 'I love this game, i\'ve been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can\'t see or control what I\'m doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.',
       'Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it\'s trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.',
       'Very addictive game.  Next version here are some thoughts:  show some flames on re-entry.  Docking clamps so you can put fuel into orbit and pickup additional fuel so you can go to Venus and return to earth.  Put the rest of the planet\'s in there.  Make it so you can take cargo such as rocket parts to moons and other so you can build a rocket there that can go further due to low gravity at launch.  I really liked this game and a lot could be done with it.',
       'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.' ],

The minus is city is to small for lot of player like that. Very crowd, i cant even see other player appereances. So camera angle maybe you can make lil bit wider or higher so city can looked much bigger',

It feels like im just taking chances here to be able to play. This all started in the afternoon for me. Not sure bout the rest.

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not.

       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'Its a good game however there isnt a very clear plot to the game therefore it doesnt hook the player. Others may argue thaat the game is just meant to be  a bit of fun and there isnt supposed to be a clear storyline however to me i feel like its a bit boring. Anyway its a good game i would recomend it to my friends',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and' ],

I know this seems minimal, but at the end in completing the backyard it will in fact be important. Please help',

I\'m so glad, I\'ve been able to play past what I could yesterday and redid my review.',

     [ 'Well let\'s see ..played the game fixed 7 cars and I made about $70,000 on the game I bought another car and had to replace just about all the parts on it I bought all the parts and was in the process of putting all the parts on it and in the middle of that ,the game shut down on me I opened it back up to continue playing and it had started back over from the beginning at the tutorial and I lost all progress. y\'all need to fix this. until this is fixed and or I am put back where I was on the game then I would not recommend downloading this game or any of the other mechanic games for 2018, much less even playing it. it\'s a waste of time and data also had a trouble with the other 2018 version mechanic game you will see a posting on that one where it\'s not giving enough time to fix panels and it\'s not registering clicking on panels to find out if anything\'s messed up on them .thanks for the problems and the issues. This game is on this phone of mine and the other game is on my other phone developers. You\'ll see a post on the other garage mechanic 2018 game by Wesley wright. Yaw need to fix these issues ok , because these bad ratings I have been seeing by others isn\'t looking good for you games.',
       'Game is great but I would\'ve loved some more features or more cars it gets repetitive real fast please add more features like OBD SCAN or inside car customizations also pc version you can change rims and wheels lights bumpers and add more cars not saying you should add all that but maybe some if possible to make it less repetitive',
       '"Breaks" is misspelled, and the photo button is in German or something. Cool game, can really help someone learn how a car works.',
       'Hi, I think this game is great, but it has a problem. Whenever I try to scroll on the menus all the items in the menu dissappear.  Would you please see what you can do to fix this?',
       'I tried to play but i can only paint the car. The engine parts changin creates problems,u cant select the part to disasembly...',
       'After playing this on the PC, I had high hopes for this. However, it never quite delivers, even though the potential is there.  Unfortunately, all you can do is restore barnfinds, rather than helping customers. This is a really a big miss, as that\'s what a mechanic often does.  The bodywork repairs are so dumbed down, which is probably done to make it more accessable for younger players. Unfortunately, by doing that, it doesn\'t feel engaging at all. It really feels like a toddler\'s game in that respect.  Fixing the rest of the cars is more to my liking, although it feels like it us missing a ton of content. I want to repair stuff myself instead of simply buying parts, test things with meters, lift the car with proper lifts, tyre machines, all that sort of stuff. Obviously a mobile game cant always create a carbon copy on a mobile platform, but in this case it feels like too much content has gone missing, even for a mobile game.  And last but not least, making people wait for new cars to fix with timers on the barns is just a no-no. You want us to play, but not too much. You rather have us pay to play properly. For me, that\'s probably the most annoying part of the entire game. Due to repairs being dumbed down so much, you fly through \'em. So after 10 mins of playing you get stuck waiting for a barn to open up. Terrible. Feels like there\'s an \'uninstall\' coming up...' ],

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.' ],

     [ 'Game unresponsive to any input on Nvidia Shield / Android TV as of the Feb 28 release.  It worked great before. Now the game starts but then it’s unresponsive to any input (controller, remote, keyboard). Other games work normally. I tried everything. Running latest version of OS, cleared game cash, game data, uninstalled game, restarted Nvidia Shield then reinstalled game. Same thing, not accepting any other input.  If this problem is resolved, I will edit my review back to 5 stars since I love the game.',
       'Update: the game keeps stealing coins from me. I had 227 coins, won a single prize, immediately play a game or two with the character, and the next time I looked I only had 16 coins. And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I\'d love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn\'t block the view of oncoming traffic.',

Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.' ],

     [ 'So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',
       'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that\'s by design so I spend money. Which I won\'t do. I just want some "bubblegum" to past the time.  Now, it\'s making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...',
       'I  love this game but why does it take 30 minutes for a life to refill and also why does everyone who plays the game not receive ten lives only some of your players this needs to be fixed it\'s not fair I\'ve been playing for years and only receive five lives at a time when others receive ten lives.I play other games and the lives refill every 7 to 15 minutes. Can you please make changes',
       'Nice game challenging to think ahead. But, basically this game is cheating on you. Levels are far too difficult to complete without boosters. So, after failing several times the not so random appearing tiles give you a lot of boosters. That prevents to uninstall (at least until you master the highest level and you enter the Legends Arena) !' ],

     [ 'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can "regrow" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It\'s so simple but soothing and really addictive!!',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.' ],

THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',

I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',

     [ 'Well, I still liked Duel Generations better, and wish that that game would work again, but I have to admit that visually and game play wise Deul Links is pretty amazing. Especially for a free game. I haven\'t gotten very far into it yet, but so far it\'s intuitive and just really slick looking. However, there is one reason I still would prefer Generations, and that is because I loved the inclusion of ALL versions of Yu-Gi-Oh, not just the first series. I grew up with 5DS  and Zexal more than anything, and I wish that those series could be incorporated into the game somehow. I\'d love to be able to play as Kite or Astral or something.',
       'Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it\'s been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you\'re at with the game!',
       'this truly an amazing game, there\'s really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad, I just don\'t see why you\'d need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it\'d be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they\'ve purchased IRL. I bet that\'d get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊',
       'My app is not opening. I love this game wish you have have out more different cards in the packs. I would like to see swords of reveling light. A bunch of rare magic and trap cards. You should not be able to use Odion\'s chain reaction duel sense in the PvP duels.',
       'Never played Yugioh this is the first time in this game and it is easily accessible with this game to get into this card game. I liked Yugioh better than the other TCG game like Pokémon,Hearthstone,Magic etc and I thought they are kind of more complicated for me because of their sourcing system like mana and energy while its all about monster cards, traps and spells etc. Very good card game and newbie friendly in general both those wanting to get into Yugioh and card gaming in general :D',
       'Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you\'re a competitive player that doesn\'t like to get bs, don\'t play this.' ],

     [ 'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'I love the game!really entertaing!but i HOPE you ADD THIS WISHLIST!Here\'s  my wishlist of superstars to this game that will make it even better,FIRST OFF,REY MYSTERIO,HULK HOGAN,THE BOOGEYMAN, SHANE MCMAHON$, AND LAST FOR THE BEST,THE DUDLEYS AND THE DX! (Including  new age outlaws ajd xpac too)and change the shirts of shawn and triple h into the dx shirts PLZ! I mostly think you\'ll  add these legends for RAW 25 years characters and rey as the royal rumble character!',
       'reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.',
       'So honestly i love most of this game. However, you can notice that when gathering loot chests, there is a normal wheel of fortune scenario, with a decipherable pattern. However, if you look closely the game changes the options on the wheel if you come close to getting one of the better options. So instead of getting a 4 star superstar in big bundles you will get the crappiest 2 star superstar and in others you will get 150 cash insteadof a superstar. Ita ridiculous because that means that how much ever money you spend on the game, they rig it so you cannot win the bigger items.',
       'Definitely a good game. Not into always writing reviews but this game calls for it. The only thing which irritates me again and again is the opening of loot cases because no matter when I click I would never get the desired character or thing as it changes the order once I click it so that I end up getting something worthless. The order doesn\'t change otherwise. So is this just in order to avoid players to gain good characters so that we have to make in app purchases ? Have given it a good rating just because of the actual excellence of the game.',
       'In the famous words of Ric Flair Wooo! This game is the best they got characters like AJ Styles to Characters like Goldberg and Mankind swipe control i like i like it all besides a few things the theme song for this game is terrible and i dont like how after you win the wrestlers theme song  doesn\'t play that would make it even better if you could update that' ],

They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',

I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',

There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',
       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general.

       'Very great game, I can pic some logic questions here and ask it on my friends ang classmates. It really gives me a brain exercise. Wheneve I feel bored, this game takes my bored away',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'this is a very good game for training your concentration, you cant just randomly played it.. timing and dexterity are main thing here, and love how this game makes my heart race, just as any good game.. really loved it.. and the premium for no ads are cheap, thank you HBA dev.',
       'This brain definitely makes me feel like the front of my head is working. But the constant advertisements between every few levels is very annoying. Especially when a level takes 15 seconds and the ad runs the same length.  Would suggest the paid version if you like it.' ],

     [ 'EDIT: My main complaint was the constant downloading, but I just discovered that you can do a Batch Download through the settings! I recommend doing it after you are done rerolling (4000+ files), but it makes the game SO MUCH BETTER!   My other issue is a personal preference: I wish I could play this in portrait mode. Landscape only makes it somewhat less than a mobile game IMO.   That being said, the game itself is AMAZING.',
       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. The Color stones that are locked, can\'t be unlocked using gems anymore. Didn\'t see it in update, please fix.',
       'Best mobile final fantasy game out there. You get all characters without money. The only thing you pay for is gems for weapons and armour. Haven\'t paid a cent yet and can complete the hardest content to date.',
       'Great game to pass the time. Love the nastoligia. I hope more variety of monsters come soon. Bat,goblin,bomb,wolf repeat....haha. there are more but still pretty lacking given how many are in game. I like the progression system a lot and easy to farm gems.',
       'Great Final Fantasy game. Though the combat is a bit more simplified than a typical FF (since it tries to emulate Dissidia\'s Bravery system in a turn based setting) it still requires thought in your actions and deciding when to hit HP or not. In terms of content, the story is an interesting take on Dissidia\'s lore and it seems to focus more on the mundane interactions between the diverse array of characters.  Story chapters are still being released (looked up what to expect from the current Japanese version and we still have a ways to go) thus introducing more and more characters. Overall it\'s a fun take on the FF franchise that brings together many of the characters that remind fans why we got into it in the first place. My only gripe is that chapters 8 and 9 can\'t get here soon enough (2 characters i am particularly looking forward to)',
       'I\'m so sad I missed out on getting Squall! Must have been an event-only thing. Oh well, I managed to get Setzer and Vanille, so that\'s something. Game is great, can\'t wait for the rest of the story. Also will any other characters from other Dissidias be in this? I\'d love to have me a Lightning or Tidus.' ],

     [ 'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I could only rate this 1 star as the app does not open, it gives a message saying Unfortunately Super Mario Run has stopped working. Disappointed as I was hoping to get My Nintendo points.  Installed on both my tablet and my phone, neither installation works.  Very disappointing.' ],

     [ 'A very good puzzle game. Worth the few dollars for no ads. Literally just used my Google Rewards to pay for it. I have only really played Connect.   My only gripe is that the squares or hexes are too small so it is very hard to navigate the puzzle without breaking previous connections. My other issue is that at times connections randomly disconnect. Fixing these issues would make the game more relaxing',
       'I hink this game is great! It is fun and super addictive and has helped me through boredom. The only problem I have with this game is the tangram graphics as it tends to bug quite a bit. Overall I think the game is amazing and I hope to see more stunning content!',
       'Love how many different types of games there is to play very addictive and if you get board playing one game you just pick a different one. It\'s great for those who don\'t sleep very well like myself. The only fault is there is far too many adds please get rid of them 😊',
       'Absolutely love this app. Its a great way to pass the time and the fact that it has multiple puzzles all in one is fantastic, since my attention span wavers. This keeps me constantly bouncing around to different challenges so its hard to get bored. ❤',
       'Way too many ads! The puzzle content is fun, but the "new" games you unlock are just variations of the first ones you get. The amount of ads make the game play really annoying.',
       'I find all these puzzles are fairly easy.  I played every game.  Master skill and managed to beat all 50 all games. This app makes you feel smart. Its so easy that it\'s a good game to play when you need to multi task while watching tv. I went public and noticed there have been hundreds of others already mastered this app as well.' ],

     [ 'I like the game, and it\'s addictive, but the mechanics are absolutely flawed. There have been tons of instances where the game has unfairly screwed me or other player\'s over. 1. Places mystery boxes in front of the player who drives second, but not the first player. 2. Hills like to stop a ball, that is being shot full force by an iron club, in it\'s tracks. 3. The swinging spike balls only affect some players golf balls, but not others.  Things like this piss people off, because they expect the game to be fair. Those small things easily aid a player in losing a match.',
       'Game cheats, puts you against lower lol players with better equipment who make ungodly shots, or much higher level where you don\'t have a chance. I hit things that aren\'t there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.',
       'The game doesnt allow you to get a proper pull back on your swing. To much clutter on some stages. Plus those who play too win always beat those who dont',
       'Uhm... Playing cod pissed me off so much because of the hacking I stopped playing. Same goes for this game..good luck to all that want to play and get ripped off. F U .',
       'Where to begin with this garbage game. The game designers aren\'t sure whether gems or strokes should win the hole. Oh..out of bounds shots don\'t incur penalties, which is idiotic. Also, pairings vary wildly in an unfair manner. You could have someone with 500 more exp. than you..hardly fair. Also, the opponent might have a tail wind of 4mph, but your shot moments later has a headwind. Again, poor conception and unfair. Just avoid this game. The inconsistency is bewildering and having an opponent win the hole even though they hit out of bounds is stupid.',
       'Completely rigged!! If u spend a ton of money on this you will be fine! I am uninstalling. If they make it fun and not have to spend crazy amounts of money to win and be fun then I may re install.' ],

I\'ve tried a few times to get free gems by installing game\'s or completing a quiz but I only sometimes get the gems after. And the casino boat thing is a joke. You barely win anything😕 I noticed nearly everyone is complaining about the same thing so I\'ve been waiting for this to be sorted. Nothing has changed so I\'ll be deleting the app shortly..... What a pity!',
       'If you love using your hard earned money for virtual play this is the game for you. What starts out with gems being a few at low amts as you advance the gem amt grows ridiculously outrageous. Move on because this game will break your bank account quickly.',
       'It\'s a pretty entertaining game. BUT you have to buy EVERYTHING with gems (aka real money). Programmers focus excessively on making players pay even before they are hooked to the game!!! After getting to the second street zone, I find myself unable to continue unless I pay. I find it a little lame after all the effort you put on creating a pretty good game. Bye',

It\'s designed to suck out as much $$$ they can get from you. I\'d recommend you get other apps and just skip out on this one.',

Club can\'t beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don\'t know if it is a bug or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It\'s a great game to be honest.',
       'This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.',
       'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       'It does look good but I get the feeling it\'s a "stolen" idea of the game Last Day on Earth because it\'s almost the exact same thing with a few minor differences. But I\'m ok with that. I have both games and play them both. But this game has very sketchy game play, even with the graphics on low on my device, it\'s all fidgity while collecting in the resource areas. This game, though I think has better overall visuals that LDON, it still has a ways to go to get to a better game play as LEON. Keep up the good work!',

This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',

       'I downloaded it to earn gems on a diff game, and after playing the original Clash Of Clans, this is a very confusing duplicate that is hard on the eyes as far as setting up the base. I find it difficult to navigate or remember where anything is',

IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1.

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',

Fix then 5 stars',

I finally have a little sneak peek, although…                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads…ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It’s still great!' ],

     [ 'The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says "combo broken" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!',
       'Love the game! But since the update I\'m unable to purchase cars/cash. Every time I open the game it says I need to connect to the internet to make purchases even though I\'m connected and can still play multiplayer etc. Any help would be great',
       'LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT NEEDS 2 MORE THINGS TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME.  Make a motorcyle update where us players can drift motorcycles. And also make more customization options where we can add body kits exhausts spoilers coilover axle extensions and more. Thank you and please look into doing what i asked so us players can enjoy this game that has a bunch of potential. Thanks',
       'One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.',
       'New update sucked. The game is really good but its really laggy now, like i get lag spikes every second when i play in a track. Please fix this cuz i really want to play this game. I wont blame my phone on this one because in the last update, it ran smoothly, no lag. Plus my phone is an ASUS, a gaming phone, there shouldnt be lag in games like these. Please, please, please fix it and I\'ll put the ratings back to 5 stars☺️☺️',

     [ 'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It\'s not really fair for those who aren\'t of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there\'s a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)',
       'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game.',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted' ],

     [ 'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'I have downloaded and uninstalled it and did the same process over again and I still can\'t play it. It keeps telling me that it needs an active internet connection to play. Well, I can play my other internet based mobile games and I am writing this review from the same mobile device and everything else that requires internet is working so it is a fault in the game itself. It\'s a shame because I really wanted to play this but now I am going to uninstall it and not bother with it again because it is frustrating me. If the issue gets fixed somehow then I may think about playing it.',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'This game is fun but I don\'t know if it\'s a bug or they\'re doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there\'s no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I\'m about to uninstall this game.',
       'This game cheats! Don\'t get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn\'t for you. But if you don\'t care that much, like me, it\'s absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',
       'I am NOT PLAYING THIS GAME ANYMORE.. all they want is your money.... they rarely give you  free dice and when they do it will be 1 most of the time.. as you play you will see that the dice don\'t roll your way as much as they did when you started, causing you to use your extra rolls, buying more dice.. I mistakenly pressed a large amount purchase, I contacted them and they made it impossible for me to get a refund.. they gave me an email address and 6 times it was returned to me, saying that they refused receipt..  DO NOT BUY EXTRA ROLLS..' ],

     [ 'It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn\'t cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.',
       'Although FoE is very enjoyable, it can get very complicated, especially for new players. The biggest drawback is the lack of instructions...new players, unless taken under the wing of an experienced player, have to fumble through at first, many times guessing or using trial and error to accomplish the simplest things.',
       'At first I was a little unhappy with the amount of stuff I can do with spending diamonds, but I now find it refreshing, not to spend active hours on a game in order to receive a reward. I\'m glad they reward patience.',
       'This is a really good solid game that you can play at your own rate. You don\'t need to spend money and someone can\'t attack and wipe you out in a night. Many faceted play that will keep you busy and entertained from start until......well, ever I guess.',

       'It\'s,........AMAZING I LOVE IT RATE IT FIVE STARS BUT THE  problem is that I got 50 diamonds and the story said research the pottery but I need 100 more that equals 150 diamonds so I need more diamondsBUT I LOVE IT ITS THE BEST GAME!' ],

     [ 'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10',
       'Need to fix glitches in the lunges. Stunned when picking up a coin or going through it in to a enemy when instead of stopping. Random stuns even you have a successful strike. And you need to put more green and red guys in sooner. Also theres a glitch where the black dot turns grey and you strike but its too early.' ],

Full of bugs and the game freezes constantly and if it crashes mid game you wont be reimbursed your wager or energy. The old family feud was great. This is just garbage. Uninstalled and moving on.',

       'Geared only for Americans, takes an hour to get another ticket, answers like "go for a run "are incorrect only to find the actual answer is "running" are a few reasons why I have not enjoyed the game.

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',

Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',

I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',

     [ 'I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I\'m not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain\'t getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I\'m from Michigan,we\'re both married ,but there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜' ],

You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'For the fact that we can\'t sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it\'s a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it\'s in the real The Sims games.' ],

     [ 'Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',

The group event games are picked I think to take all our chips so we will be forced to buy I believe that until you make the payouts on the slots better you are going to lose a lot of customers.',

Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products.',

I waited for update after update --- but to no avail. I was stuck. Not so fun anymore. So I uninstalled and reinstalled --- and lost over 13,000 points.  But at least I got to play again. I built my way back up... only to have it glitch again, sending me back to the Feather league. More frustrating than fun #Fail' ],

Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I\'ve ever played',

       'I\'ve just realized that this game is for people that have gambling addiction trates, people who will keep spending money to advance.  I got a offer to buy a car in the game, limited time offer it said only 10,000 tokens, so I looked up how much that was out of curiosity? $149! Are you for real? Someone must be on drugs to come up with these prices. I just feel sad for the ones that do pay for these so called offers. May Gameloft be cursed until you take away your greed.',

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.' ],

IT\'S AMAZING AND I BET YOU\'LL HAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 4 MONTHS!!!',

       'This game is fun but one problem.  My ball keeps randomly rolling off the edge for no reason. Plz fix this then u will get 5 stars.',
       'This game is great. The levels are challenging and fun but personally I think this game could be a lot better if you added a level editor so you could make levels and post them online for others to try. This would totally make your game a lot more exciting and fun.',
       'It\'s a great game, but after about 5 or 6 months it doesn\'t load probably get it but be aware that sometimes it won\'t load I have it and it is terrible that after a short time it won\'t load the game!Please fix this!',

     [ 'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!',
       'After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. 😄  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it\'s time for me to kill more zombies 😎',
       'I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn\'t have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time',
       'The idea of the game and the graphics are sweet, solid story line.... But what makes the game blow and not want to play anymore is how you have to level up the guns ( which is impossible to get to where you need to be with the weapons power level wise unless you drop cash.  You shoot a zombie in the head, that should be it....it shouldn\'t take 5 shots to kill the fucker. Wanna make it tougher? Just add more zombies then. Don\'t make them impossible to kill. You should also be able to reload when ever you want. At least the first few levels were fun.',
       'Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it.',

       'YAY! FINALLY A GAME LIKE MINECRAFT!!!!!!! Except it doesn\'t have stuff like the animals, buckets, iron doors eg. But what is the Nether react core? It is just a made up block. But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch\'s, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, "Minecraft". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man\'s best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!',
       'Love the game! My only problem is that for some reason, when I grow wheat and try to get a cow to follow me, well they just ignore me. I haven\'t been able to find carrots for the pigs either. Frankly, I would like to be able breed animals pure and simple. Otherwise good job',
       'I really like this game. I\'ve never played Minecraft and since it cost money to download the app, this is something fun for me to play and not need to spend money. The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn\'t seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there\'s a lot I haven\'t figured out yet, but it\'s been fun learning.',
       'It is a nice game but it is just shot of (some) things.. e.g animals, red stone ,pail (can contain milk ,water and lava or it can be empty) , red stone torch, paintings (diffirent sizes),mobs. Also, it would be nice if you can label the items that we picked so that it would be easier for us to pick the item that we want. I hope you can add some more items into the game.it will be more thrilling to play. Thanks' ],

Most troubling issue is that after I spent $119.99 for 200,000 points I believed I would be able to purchase all vehicles and packs in this App and developer\'s other iterations of this same type of App. Turns out I wasn\'t able to purchase all vehicles in this App but couldn\'t use my points across developer\'s other racing App\'s. Now I\'m stuck with 185,000 points and pretty much out $100.00 does not make me happy at all. I would like this developer to contact me somehow as I don\'t have contact info. Thanks' ],

     [ 'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game but it takes far too long to progress. Gems are way too far and few between to enable you to \'buy\' better vehicles to defeat the boss. Then you have to also use more gems to get weapons! If you don\'t spend money it takes a long time to get anywhere. If there were more gems available this game would be a 5 star game.',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!',
       'I would give more stars, because it\'s very addictive and fun to pass the time. But it just contains WAY TOO MANY ADS. Like holy crap I  get 3 different ads back to back after every single run. Kills my battery quickly and I spend more time watching the ads than I do actually playing the game.',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me' ],

     [ 'I love that you don\'t lose troops while defending. The only problem is the cost to heal them is rediculous. There are many aggressive players that assault you early on in the game and unless you pay money it becomes difficult to maintain a stable civilization. I believe it would be better if there were cheaper or easier ways to gain resources for those whom don\'t pay to win. Thank you for the amazing game though! Love you guys and I will never quit playing!',
       'I like the game but there is some bullying that happens. No limit on how many times a player can attack you. I was attacked 60 times in an hour by the same player killing every troop I had, cleaning out all my resources and destroyed one of my bases. It is just plain malicious. I have brought it up before and no one cares to do anything to fix it.  Update: I sent the above message months ago and received no response. This is classic "pay-to-play" tactics that promote bullying to get you to pay for upgrades. I won\'t be playing anymore.',
       'I like the game. Has a few things that are a pain though. Like you cant share resources if they were bought, what does that even matter. I also dont like that your avatar can only be your facebook pic or an in game one..give me the option to upload my own pic without changing my facebook one.',
       'Very unbalanced.  Dominated by purple, orange, and blue hordes. If you start as any other horde color you will be raided constantly with no support. Be prepared to spend lots of money on peace shields...',
       'I don\'t understand the hype. 5 minutes into it and was already waiting an hour for an upgrade. No activities or anything else to do. One last thing, you only start with a 24 hour peace shield... n I\'m out.',
       'Game starts off fun for the low level people.  Leveling up for mid level people is next to impossible without spending a lot of real money or playing the game 24/7.  You have to constantly keep your troops hidden and protected as there is always a higher level person out there that will injure/kill every single one of them.   Training 100k+ troops takes MONTHS and they will be killed instantly the moment you forget to protect your troops for an hour.  I don\'t know how this game is rated so high,  it must be from all the initial reviews submitted by early new players.' ],

You can pay 2 bucks to remove the ads, but isn\'t necessarily going to make the experience better.  The ads are short, for the most part, but still can get annoying if you\'ve played 10 puzzles in a row.  And considering you can complete a puzzle under or around the 2 min mark, those ads add up.

       'I didn\'t hold out much hope initially but it\'s a fabulous game. Graphics are good, there\'s a story and multiple maps etc. Its easy to progress and the special event maps were hilarious.  Definitely suitable for the majority of players and even young ones. There\'s no gore or unsuitable scenes and no constant push to buy ingame content. I wish more game developers thought like this. Properly enjoyable',
       'Great game, incredible customer service. You will never get bored with this game. Play daily as much or as little as you want. There are seasonal (timed) events to play and ongoing daily (no time limit)searches. We have all been there, missed an achievement because we logged on 10 minutes late. NO MONEY has to be spent to truely enjoy this game. Your progress or fun level isn\'t held hostage if you don\'t want to pay to play. Customer service is incredible. I was stuck and the response was quick and helpful. Even when I still didn\'t get it, think if it was a snake, it would have bitten me, they helped and never made me feel stupid. Install NOW and start having fun.',
       'Energy is spent too quickly, kind of their way of trying to make you to buy gems. I get it, and I would buy them if they weren\'t so expensive! I can barely make it through a single task, it does get quite annoying.   Maybe give us the option of watching ads for gems or extra energy, and an ad free option with minimal cost so those who would rather not have the ads get to benefit too?',
       'Love the challenge,  the mini puzzles.  The only draw back I would say.  As a new player having enough energy to complete some of the old challenges example (Valentine\'s 2017) is almost impossible.  Would love to figure out how to gain more energy. Fan page as far as I can see does not help on this.  Other then  that very enjoyable game.' ],

     [ 'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'A lot of Numberlink programs have "fake" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard "rules" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn\'t do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I\'ve been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.',
       'Edit: New horrible LOUD advertising you can\'t stop. Very disturbing to others and prevents usage around others.   Great puzzle games, lots of levels from easy to very hard. However it will eat your battery like there is no tomorrow. If your phone is plugged in, it will overheat. Use for more than about 15 minutes and your phone will burn your hand and shut down.' ],

     [ 'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'Good for killing time. Some of the computer driven opponents seem to have a very decisive advantage at initial start of certain stages, and some of the smaller vehicles are too sensitive on the controls  but overall decent game.',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.',

     [ 'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'The best game on market right now. No ads, unless you request it for coins,(which I doubt you\'ll need to), many modes, including HELL(Infinite waves), MAP(To gain access to abilities and magic) and BATTLE(Normal wave advancement with bosses every 5 levels.). By far the best game that advertises it is not pay to play. Because it\'s not, despite the option to buy coins.',
       'I\'m really loving this game it\'s simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!' ],

     [ 'Games are great and always challenging although I cannot believe that top place persons can make 3 selections per second and analyze each move.   Update: the more I play this app the more I am sure these top people cannot be making that number of moves in one second. It takes at least a second to view any new cards and decide your moves. I believe a computer is actually playing for them. These top numbers are not realistic! I still enjoy the game but makes me feel really inferior.',
       'Just love the challenge of completing the cards. Great customization, tracks your best score and compares against others playing. Would be nice if you could replay a Winning Deal immediately after not \'ve finished it, if you want to try and improve your score. If you can replay them, I haven\'t found how to do it. But that\'s a small thing. Just love solitaire in general, but this app specifically. Had it for a couple years now. Love it!!  3/1/2018 - Follow up. This app has now used over 4 GB of data for February. I had 6 GB plus and I got the notice from T-Mobile that I have 1 GB left. Checked my data usage and solitaire showed to use 4.3 GB for month. What the bleep is going on? I love this game, but not at the expense of all my data. Hopefully that\'s a bug. If not i ve got to uninstall. Please tell me that\'s a bug.',

       'As of this morning there is no tab for daily challenges... Which is frustrating since I\'m trying to complete them on the day.  The adverts are ridiculous.. I know we can skip them after 5 seconds but to display an advert after almost every game is beyond frustrating.  Furthermore for some reason my bottom navigation which is found on my screen is never visible in the app, forcing me always lock and unlock it if I want to use the home, back or options buttons.',

     [ 'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don\'t waste it here. Good luck!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!' ],

     [ 'Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D',
       'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed',
       'I love the first one and second game of this but the third one it\'s not so good I feel like no one should get the third one only the first and second Dumb Ways to die you can\'t even play the games you did on the first and games you did on the first and second one only the mini games and it\'s only four of those so this is what I\'m going to say about this app' ],

       'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',

If that was not bad enough, the entities get stuck when the blade goes through them (mostly when the goblin guy spawns). Im going to keep the game installed in the hopes that these bugs will be ironed out soon. I love the idea this game presents, but I literally can\'t play it because i cannot progress through the beginning of the game due to these bugs. I reinstalled the game, but the issues still persisted. Please fix so i can enjoy your game. Thank you.',

     [ 'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'I love this game. At first time I open it after download, it still okay. But after that, at second day I open the app, my phone will be turned off immediately. I try to uninstall it and just redownload today, but still same. My phone keep turned off if I open the app. Please fix this, I really really want to play :(',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn\'t take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.' ],

     [ 'I used to be so excited about this game. Best slots out there with fun games, great graphics, and variety, but the game is too greedy now. I do not mind throwing some money at a well developed game that deserves it, but you never win anything in return. Just want you to keep spending. Such a shame, love several of the slot games.',
       'Best casino slot games, choices and addictive! I have tried others but I always come back to Club Vegas. I can\'t wait to see what "coming soon" is all about. Thank you!',
       'Small payout compared to size spent, not enough action. Not fun when all you do is get rolled. Nice slots though if your willing to pay up.',
       'Money sucking app from hell! Slot winning payout set ridiculously low so that you are forced to purchase coins to make this game playable and fun. Not cool! Stay away!!',
       'Edit 3 update: I have reported the developer to Google, it\'s been over a week without a reply after being ripped off during the " minimum x3 wheel event" good luck getting support after you have purchased and something goes wrong, these leeches won\'t be getting another cent from me.  Edit 2 Bought $19.99 coin pack during "guaranteed 3x wheel event" only received 2x on wheel, currently have a ticket open with support, if not rectified will be reporting to google.  Edit 1 And the raking over the coals continues, since last update most of my lucky spin levels have been downgraded to silver, such great value for sapphire vip tier. Buy coins watch them get sucked away, rinse and repeat. You\'ll be lucky to get 2 spins from your bonus at sapphire level.',

     [ 'I kind of miss the old version because isn\'t that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍',
       'This game is both funny as serious it\'s a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game☺',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',

     [ 'What a good little game. Nothing special in the graphics department but it delivers on everything it says and shows. After playing for a little while I couldn\'t help but feel like I was waiting for a little bald guy to want to eat me if I got an answer wrong, "cans we eats it precious". Jokes and riddles. Very good game. Well done.',
       'Game is really good specially for kids . Makes them think. Only bad part of this game is the list in answers.. they are already displayed. This makes the game very easy. It would make an awesome game if user had to enter the answers.. hope the developers fix this!',
       'Way TOO MANY adds. It\'s more a front end for advertising & the questions are way to simple to the point of being inane. Mildly entertaining if you like to feel smart but only a diversion for a matter of minutes. Personally I much rather apps where for a payment you can remove the adds but this isn\'t one!',
       'The concept is cool and the riddles are fun but I dislike that it gives you four options to choose from and most of the time, it makes it very obvious what the right answer is. I would love this if it let you type in your answer or give you a section similar to hangman and you can fill in the letters for your guess. That way it actually makes you think and figure out the riddles instead of picking the word you think or know fits best. I also can\'t stand how many ads pop up during a game so simple like this. If they limited the ads and changed the layout and used a different font style I think it would highly imporove the game. But that\'s just my opinion so don\'t let this review stop you from trying it for yourself. I just think a little more time and effort could\'ve gone a long way for this app.',
       'I think instead of giving me an A+ on everything including the one I PURPOSELY did wrong is dumb. If we get 1 right make a 10% if we get 5 right male It a 50% if we get 7 right make it a 70% and so on. So instead of giving an A++ when I got 4 right give a D or F.',
       'I found "500 Riddles" to be somewhat misleading.  After the first few levels the riddles started to repeat.

     [ 'Kind of reminds me of skulls of the Shogun (although I don\'t know which was developed first). Haven\'t played multi player yet bc I\'m going to get schooled! Great game. I love all the different tribes and take no issue with shelling out a few $ to check the all out. Of course playing the free tribes leaves little to be desired if u can\'t afford the extras. Best game I\'ve come across in a WHILE.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'This game is amazing! I\'ve never been so hooked on a game before but this is just fun to play. You won\'t realize how quick time flies when you\'re playing this. I love it so much I\'m taking my sweet time collecting all the tribes. And the graphics is just fitting for the gameplay, everything about the game is just peachy. Totally recommended.',
       'balanced and very deep. You have fulfilled everything I ask for in the last review whether you read it or not. The \'modes\' list is a little sparse, however, and it would be great if you would plan some modes as a side project or something. Not that it is easy making a new mode. Well nonetheless, god job',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.' ],

       'These guys just made one game template and copy it over and over, just changing the core concept of the tycoon, be it sheep, cows, os whatever.  The game is always the same, they didn\'t even care enough to change the UI graphics or even the "story": "Guy reads journal with a revolutionary (insert concept of the game here)".  Whoever made this game, please make something decent and not copies. You are getting money for people that don\'t notice this, you should be ashamed.',
       'I love the game but I would rate it higher if you didn\'t have to pay 3 dollars to break into your gold wool bank which is totally stupid. I mean what pathetic jerks would make you do such a retarded lunatic of a thing. Stupid money hog game makers. Go blow your stink foul breath somewhere else',
       'It would be better if dog biscuit would be avaliable. In game can\'t buy new dog. So people are fade of it. They can\'t change dog or can\'t feed it. So think on it and do the changes. Afterwards the game will be good.  Neither, make the dog biscuit  avaliable with gift box. Don\'t only listen to comment also do the research on game. And changes needed do it quickly. If you can\'t do it then close your work.',
       'Money hungry app full with ads, ads in corners, ads in bonuses, heck even ads for every 15 min play, buy bait everywhere, discount notif never go offscreen even after declined. Control is just a joke, offer eagles with high speed but everytime try to click it, houses get on the way, open windows in process, heck, they didn\'t even needed, everything can be done by control bar. Outdated linking apps, yield no resource when finish their requests. Lastly, scam store review, plz don\'t believe these reviews, all bribed.',
       'A poorly optimized, unprofessional version of Egg Inc. A terrible clone. Also, the developer is clearly deleting comments and paying for good reviews or something because it\'s a very mediocre game and literally EVERY comment had the word cute in it. That\'s for a reason, we\'re not all as stupid as the kids that play this shit.' ],

It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',

HORRIBLE!! unless you can fix this, you\'re not getting a good review on my hand. Oh and also, for anyone wanting to know, it\'s 21 dollars a month for some bikes. Not in real life. Wow such a great deal... No really a great deal.' ],

     [ 'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'It\'s a really great game! I\'m really looking forward to an update. I think it\'d be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I\'m looking forward to see what you guys do!',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can\'t hit a single shot so I have to restart the game.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.' ],

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',

Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',

    description: '2DEGREES DATA HUNT 2degrees Data Hunt is back, its game on! There is 200 million megabytes of free data all over New Zealand, all you have to do is find it between 13/11/17 and 06/02/18 and it’s yours.  Using the interactive map as your guide, find 2degrees Data Pins throughout the country. When you’re in a Data Spot you’ll be able to collect data by spinning the Data Pin to find out how much free mobile data you’ve scored! All the data you collect will be loaded to your 2degrees mobile account. You could win up to 10GB – how much free data can you hunt down? Not a 2degrees mobile customer? Don’t worry you can still join the hunt, just sign up to 2degrees mobile before the 06/02/18 and any data you’ve found will be added to your account. Please note that only 2degrees Prepay, Pay Monthly, Business Choice and Business Connect customers are eligible to redeem the prize data. INTERACTIVE MAP AND DATA SPOTS The Data Hunt interactive map will guide you through the gaming experience. Make sure you have location services turned “on” then you can use the interactive map to locate the many Data Spots throughout New Zealand. When you’re in a Data Spot you’ll be able to ​switch to live view mode, this will allow you to spin and collect Data Pins. DATA PINS Every Data Spot has its own Data Pin, loaded with a range of free data values. When logged in you’ll be able to keep track of your Data Hunt progress, with live updates telling you how many Data Pins you’ve collected and their value. You can only collect data from a Data Pin once, but don’t panic, there are over 1,500 Data Pins to find and there’s up to 10,000MB to be won per 2degrees customer. GOLDEN PINS If you are a 2degrees customer, keep a look out for elusive Golden Pins. Golden Pins will pop up for a limited time every once in a while, track them down and give them a spin to score massive data amounts. It pays to get to these fast, because they don’t stick around for long. SNAP AND SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS Whenever you collect free data you’ll be able to show it off by snapping and sharing a pic with the Data Pin. We’ll be keeping an eye out and getting in touch with the people who post our favourites, so make sure we can see your post by tagging your photo with #2degreesdatahunt.If you think your friends will want to join the hunt, you can send them your unique invite code to score double data if they start playing.  Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Apple is not a sponsor or involved in the activity related to the Data Hunt App. For full Data Hunt promotions terms and conditions and Data Hunt mobile app terms of use see 2degreesmobile.co.nz.',

You can only collect data from a Data Pin once, but don&#x2019;t panic, there are over 1,500 Data Pins to find and there&#x2019;s up to 10,000MB to be won per 2degrees customer.<br> <br>GOLDEN PINS<br> <br>If you are a 2degrees customer, keep a look out for elusive Golden Pins. Golden Pins will pop up for a limited time every once in a while, track them down and give them a spin to score massive data amounts. It pays to get to these fast, because they don&#x2019;t stick around for long.<br> <br>SNAP AND SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS<br> <br>Whenever you collect free data you&#x2019;ll be able to show it off by snapping and sharing a pic with the Data Pin.

Also make sure location method set to "high accuracy". Hopefully this helps someone, app now seems to be working fine for me',

If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. 👌👍❤',

It hasent changed since when I usted to have it it would be nice to get some new maps or bikes and maybe change the layout of the menu. And maybe even a multipler more where u play with other people/friends and just free ride or challenge to see who can get more points. Other then that it is a crazy fun and addictive game.',

One more thing......You should not keep all levels payed. You should keep it like, if you beat a certain record or you finish the course faster than the time given already. Otherwise, HATS OFF TO YOU ILLUSION LABS...GREAT WORK!!!',

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',

     [ 'Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it\'s in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn\'t even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can\'t have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this',
       'This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling. It requires spending more gold or gems rather than actual skills with over priced weapons and gears. The controls are not sensitive and clunky. Overall. Could have been a great game but greedy developers.',
       'I have been searching for a game that suits me and i just found it SF2 is on my top three list of martial arts games. But there\'s a problem, your opponents who r not shadows are shadows so please change that. And could u add a multiplaer mode. Anyways good game',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.' ],

     [ 'If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don\'t mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.',
       'I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There\'s ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there\'s one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It\'s miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi',
       'Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there\'s some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That\'s pretty lame. Other than that great game',
       'That\'s crazy you allow hackers to have the highest score and also show the video. Say that person isn\'t cheating and I\'ll show you a video where he shows how he does it. A-hole.',
       'Fun...until you had to beat an opponent to proceed to next level. These opponents are too much of a jump up on the difficulty of that level. So can\'t pass...no longer fun...uninstalling',
       'Terrible game....but does have good controls... I would honestly suggest playing trial xtreme 3 before this....definitely not worth the ad you have to deal with popping up every race.' ],

     [ 'My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I\'ve got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, "mass" and magnetism... But it\'s really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can\'t... Because your "pencil" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don\'t get in your way as much as this one.',
       'It\'s an alrite game. Some people like this kind of puzzle, but I am not too fond of it. Being a freeware it has ads that can pop up before and after each puzzle... so prepared to be annoyed. Game has many solutions and offers hints(not before... you guessed it, watching an ad first) so you can atleast get through some of the harder levels. I\'d say give this game a try until you get frustrated by the app, not because of hard puzzles but because of ads.',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜' ],

     [ 'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'I\'ve reached on level 93 been at it for almost a week now. And it makes absolute no sense no matter which way I go. For example I will shoot a blue colour to burst the same colour and another colour shoots out. Can you fix this? It\'s frustrating. It\'s a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',

     [ 'I absolutely love this game. But sence this update has came out all my trucks seem like there missing a 2nd gear they almost stop at 30mph and makes tbe truck not go pst 30 utill i switchs in the 3rd. Please fix this. I love this game is one of the best offroad games ever. So much more better then gigabite offroad. By the way the motors on this game sound really cheap. But the gane runs vary smoothly on my Samsung galaxy but not on my android tablet.  Please fixe these bug then i will rate a full 5 stars woth no, if, ands or buts. Thank you for your time.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a while and I absolutely LOVE it. but the new update could definitely use some improvements. I have everything in the power category and the suspension maxed out. But everywhere I drive I just flip over and barrel roll everywhere. When I drive foward my truck wants to do a backflip and when I brake it wants to do a front flip. Also, I wish you could change the color of the roof and frontlights (aka the lightbars) but the front light bar doesn\'t even turn on nor does the top light bar that looks like the front one. Please take my review into consideration. Thanks.',
       'Love the game, used to play gigabit off-road but the devs stopped updating and there was nothing left to do. This game has so much, there are some nice trucks, you can have as many of them as you want, and there are some nice customization options. I don\'t know if these are things that are allready in development or your plans, but I would like to see more mud and maybe something like a newer powerstroke/super duty body style.',
       'I love this game so much it\'s so fun and the gameplay is great. it got even with the update but the update also made the gameplay kinda crappy like when i drive on the side of a hill or just drive and turn my truck flips over all the time and it\'s not as fun to drive cars cause the mechanics for the vehicles feel way  different and not as realistic as before the update. Please fix this i love your game',
       'Only reason I wont give 5 stars is BC anytime you go back to the menu or try to go out riding it will crash. If not on one way it will be the next. Get the crash fixed and ill give it 5',
       'I love the game, but me honetly I do a lot of bogging and I would love to see in first person camera when your riding in mud for it to sling by the windows I think that would be pretty cool and the option to switch back and forth from gas or diesel motor if we have bought the diesel motor. It\'s just some suggestions but love the game!!!!!!' ],

My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',

People paid 5 euros or even more to eliminate these ads, and now what do we get? 4 measly hearts (i. e. 4 chances to continue from checkpoints) for watching 30-60 second commercials? If I would have known it would become like this I obviously wouldn\'t have paid for it. Shameful.' ],

With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Its a great game but ive fully upgraded my earth space ship and i am level 10 on earth and mars. I have about 8000 people on europa and theres no more planets to discover so its boring now. We want alot more plants and diffrent upgrades!!' ],

EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams.

How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc\'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there\'s better players @ the position that you\'ll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!',

This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can\'t, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru',

It\'s the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦',
       'Please read this EA. PLAYING WITH THE SILVER PLAYER IN SEASON VS. MY ELITE PLAYERS ARE VERY UNUSUAL THAT ALL THE SHOTS OF SILVER PLAYER\'S GO IN AND ALL MIND IN +20 ARE NOW WOW VERY NICE GAME EA. Also When playing the auction menu when I did not Win the auction. It supposed to give me back my money coin but it did not happen. It\'s an error on your part so GIVE ME BACK MY COINS PLEASE.

When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool.' ],

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',

It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star.

     [ 'So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn\'t find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren\'t extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don\'t know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I\'m not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.',
       'Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it\'s not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I\'ve survived 24 nights but I don\'t even have the achievements for"survive 5 nights". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don\'t because some of the zombie achievements I\'m not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I\'m currently at 59. GG!',
       'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'I think that this game brings back memories of the times that we all played on the first one and seeing this new one with more actions and abilitys and many more things to do is just what I would expect from something from the old stick war 1 game and I just would love to see more stick war games like these overall I love this game and I think it was the best',
       'It\'s nice how you\'ve mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn\'t expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!' ],

     [ 'Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven\'t grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it\'d make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there\'s no use for coins.',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'First off, I\'d like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It\'s amazing.  However, I\'ve been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can\'t pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I\'m on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.',
       'This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I\'m very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing' ],

     [ 'I got to level 7 on big fish casino to get 60 gold. yet when I went back to reap my rewards I was startled! then my feeling of "startled-ness" changed to one of despair. For when I went back I realized I wasted all that time going to level 7 on big fish games and instead of having 60 gems I have 60 minutes of wasted time. Great game. Horrible reward system. I will rate the game 5 like it should be when I receive 60 gold. Unfortunately I like the game so I will continue to playing. I am level 27 after all.',
       'prices in the game are not well distributed. you can unlock new players only with gold but gold is obtained so hard. on the other hand, money is useless after some point. you can only use upgrading players but it also requires gold. you can obtain golds with watching ads and playing every tournament over and over again to level up and gain gold but after some point you cannot unlock new players (therefore cannot unlock new tournaments) because it requires so much gold. the game forces you to buy golds. fun game but only a short period of time',
       'It is the best game I have played so far but I wish the creator adds that you can fight people online in this game because it doesn\'t make sense that in  basketball PVP you can go against people online . Why not add online in this game and creator if you are reading this comment can you please add more bags add like a legendary you buy the legendary bag it has like 1,00000000000000 gold .bag for 1,00000 cash and in the legendary bag add like 1,00000000000gold like this game so much',

     [ 'Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it\'s class.',
       'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'I would of rated this 5 stars if I didnt loose all mt progress I tried logging in to google play but it said sorry mayor this city is linked to another device. This is the same phone I\'ve had it on so im really really ANGRY about it so yeah. Help me get my old city back ELECTRONIC ARTS . My city had over 100,000 population I had the airport Dr vu\'s tower and the port and everything else apart from the building so yea. Im so bummed. HELP ME PLZ',
       'i like the quests to earn gold keys & platinum keys. other players can see what is in my storage & i hope EA can block/fix that. there are still video ad problems; a video will either play or not; and it will not return me to game; and/or it will not offer the three choices. 02/20/2018. how many times do i have to rate game?' ],

The animation is beautiful and smooth and runs well on my phone. Please never change the way this game is. It gives you the option to buy things but it is very fair to those who can\'t pay due to money issues so I would definitely recommend this game. The developers should be proud of this game because it really is beautiful designed and made you can tell alot of care and effort went into perfecting this game. It\'s worth the wait on each episode, I love the stats from other players feature and how you can go back for free to see how different choices would of effect the game differently.

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',

     [ 'I played this a while back and decided to come back and see if anything had changed and it sure did. There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I\'m glad I\'m playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.' ],

     [ 'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'I love this game but, I download it several times! And the download process is always stop at 98.8% and not finishing. And its say Download Error please check your connection setting! But my wifi connection is fine.Please help me ASAP i want this game so much',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'I rated this 1st for 5 star but now I am changing it to 1 star... RR3 very good update for 2018 but for ur 5th birthday congratulations.. N gift u have given to us is very worst gift n worst car u have given us free..... I was expecting very good gift from rr3 n millions of players play the game n u give such a cheap car n it\'s like tortoise.... U could have given a better car so that the players fell happy n play the game' ],

     [ 'This game has so much potential to be an awesome game except for one factor, you require way yo much real money to move ahead. This truly is a pay to win, change that and the amount of people downloading this game will remain playing imo.',
       'Its an alright game and i advise people to play but would be better if people who walk by your clubhouse could be mugged to get more money and maybe sneak attacks would be good so you might be able to take some money without anybody knowing and when people are bringing cigarettes to california you could intercept the vans. Overall great game',
       'Great game. Cost alot.  Definitely more fun when you have alot of coins.   But bikers do cost way to much. There needs to be an adjustment there.',
       'Didn\'t like it at first but if you can afford to buy coins a lot more fun. Seals matchups for New York are complete b.s. though',
       'Really like the game and could be a great game. I would rate higher but there are a few issues. First issue I see is it shouldn\'t cost so much to train more bikers. When you take over territory most of, if not all, the money you gain has to be spent on replacing the bikers you lost. The reward should be higher or the cost of training more bikers should be lower. The other issue I see is the goals section. A lot of them have too many requirements to reach the goals. Make the goals simpler. Also they are not set up in a way to help you progress in the game, they are pretty much random or the goal can not be reached until you are much further in the game. For instance, one goal is to get some properties to level 5. Once you complete that the goal jumps to make properties level 30. That\'s a huge jump and somewhat disheartening. It\'s kinda ridiculous to jump from lvl 5 to lvl 30. It takes way too long to go from 5 to 30 and will prolly make a lot of ppl stop/not want to play the game. Improve the goals section and make the rewards better and it will help make the game more successful.',

     [ 'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.',
       'Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.',

It is wonderful for me because there is not a single problem. It doesn\'t seem to be bad for me i  meant the game was not at all bad and it was particularly different from some of the reviews means some people said this game this and that but it doesn\'t seem to me the same thing because each of us has a different choice but according, to me it was great, amazing, wonderful game. Thanks for making this types of games and it is good because it teaches us something so thx once again. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋',

So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',

     [ 'This is one of the best strategy RPG I\'ve played in recent years. This is exactly what a mobile RPG should be like.   There are a lot of twists and turns, funny and interesting interactions and I like how the creator is also involved in the game. What I love most about it is that there\'s a story being told. Even after you lose (and you will lose a lot) the story keeps going forward.  The thing I\'m not that big of a fan of is the micro transactions in this game, there are quite a lot of em, I understand why the creator does this but if all of the money he gets from micro transactions goes directly to this game in order to improve the game I\'m all in.  Good job on the game, creator!',
       'Hmh. Where to begin my experience with Lapse? Well, it is a definite "give it at least a try. It is completely free as well. Any money you give to dev will be out of your own willing. And honestly, if you play this game and don\'t give a few cents to this guy, you are either very poor(understandable) or pretty much a cheap arsehole. Clearly the dev worked a lot at this game and the game with his endings and twists and turns is easily worth at least a $5 or £5. It is a simple phone RPG and I honestly had more fun than with games which costed me 10£. Great story, very well written with plot twists and funny characters interactions. Loved it. 8/10',
       'Your actions have consequences, sometimes applying the F-it adjustment is great for rewards. Also really captures the idea that even though you are being corrupt it\'s for the greater good, an interesting perspective. Absolutely love this game',
       'Very interesting concept, there are a lot of mysteries to solve and the game really challenges you to manage what few resources you have carefully. There are few outright good options, most of them force you to expend a resource in order to obtain another (eg let corporations dump nuclear waste for some extra cash), and sometimes despite your best efforts you get killed by radiation or overthrown by your military.',
       'I haven\'t finished the game yet, but this is WILD so far. It\'s very addicting and has me seriously thinking about the consequences of my actions.',

     [ 'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'It\'s pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It\'s hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it\'s a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There\'s multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don\'t recommend this game.',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....' ],

     [ 'The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.',
       'GG easy. everyone whining being pay to play this that. i never bought anything and I\'m loving this, just need a little patience and you can do many things untill one thing gets done or upgraded. I\'m high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.',
       'I love the game.  The thing is, this game just gets boring.  For example,  all you can do right now is to vanquish invasions. That\'s basically it. The portal is not always open.  The tournament? Well the match ups are way too oblivious.  My in game friends already have started quitting coz of these problems. You have to add something fun soon. Well it is still a fun game tho.',
       'Would be a great game if it wasn\'t blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can\'t defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don\'t get attacked too much and lose all your resources.',
       'Been playing since early access relese. Game is very well built. But like all other games. The ads now bugged. The daily quest for the ad has never worked for me. Starts ad restarts app no credit. Oh well its an ad right. Well now your forcing me to watch them. Please fix So can i atleast finish those 2 daily quest?!?!?!  Also since update my androids menu buttons overlay all buttons on far right/left hand of screen depending on tilt. Phone is an LG stylo 3. Please address and i will rerate later.',
       'Everything is pay to play. The constant need for microtransactions is absurd. $10-$20 at a time. If you don\'t pay, you have to wait days to upgrade resources. If you want to compete, no matter how much you level, you are just under supplied to win, unless you my for resources. Game play is awesome, but setup is garbage.' ],

It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',

I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',

       'I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people\'s choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player',
       'I love this game....  But I would like if there we can play offline....  And there is so many hackers!!!!!!  Try to band them..... And please Change that there is two missions in a day so we can open chest.....  So we can get skins...... Please..... Thank u of u guys change....  Love this game....

     [ 'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!',
       'It\'s been nice...I\'m happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you "Dataverse", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long.

As the level goes up, maybe the minimum increases slightly.  *Tools!!!! Ive never seen a pawn shop without tools. We need tools *Cars, go carts, motorcyles, 4wheelers. Wheres that stuff at?. *Guns, no guns either. Like civil war era type items, unless these are all avaliable at much higher levels.',
       'Overall this game is fun. Only bad thing to say is there is way too many ads. I believe it discourages you from playing the game longer due yo an ad every like 30 seconds',
       'Game was going ok the bam , hit a brick wall and all of a sudden bidding went stupid.. you either go backwards because you don\'t win any bids or you lose thousands on the ones you do " win " on.  Very disappointing.   Clearly set up for those buying players who spend money to play.',

     [ 'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I\'m not a game player, but this game is a lot of fun, AND, you never have to spend a dime! Of course, unless you want to spend money!  I do wish the direction went into a little more depth. It would make it a little easier for new people to understand the extra things, like the snow boarding and the regatta.' ],

     [ 'Extremely fun, I had an old account and I was level 27. But I had to get a new phone and did data transfer in time. Now I gotta start all over... But it\'s still really fun. Just kinda mad that I can\'t get back to where I was.  Edit: I keep getting communication errors and haven\'t been able to do a mission all day. All my stamina, gone. I let it refill still couldn\'t finish a story mode even. I had a good connection too',
       'I only rated it a three because this game needs to fit my screen. I own a Galaxy S8 and to have a title such as Naruto published by Bandai not fit the screen is something I\'d think they should fix right away so new players don\'t have this issue and leave the game. I love the gameplay a lot and the raiding part is fun, I just don\'t like not having a clue ifnI\'m spending ryo or the in game currency.  Please fix this issue.',
       'It is one of the best game I\'ve ever played on mobile. I have just one issue. In this update, the traps don\'t work properly as before. A person is standing on the trap position but does not get stuck/hit by that. It took alot of time to set those traps and with this new update, all goes into waste. Please fix that.',
       'It\'s very fun and addictive but there\'s a bug few and then. I lost my 50 shinobite while summoning just like that because it was stuck at the summon loading page and I didn\'t even receive any ninja cards. I hope you can fix it and also refund my 50 shinobite at the very least. 😭',
       'BANDAI! What are we supposed to do with all the extra Ryo/Gold that we have?? Add costumes or something cool! Come on now. I\'ve paid over $500 dollars, y\'all got money, I know you do, you also have time! Just please deliver something great in the future, Special Attack Missions are a lot of fun :D',
       '50 summons (30 tokens 1000 shinobites)  I got 24 2 stars, 25 3 stars and 1 4 star. Why was my luck this bad,  was it because I did not pay any money?  A pay to win game' ],

     [ 'I love these games, really, and I was on a roll, but I can\'t get pass level 48 because my Wiko LENNY3 touch screen isn\'t responsive enough to register both fingertips at the same time. EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can\'t wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.',
       'Brilliant follow-up to YELLOW! ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! And, there ARE games trying to pretend that they\'re the same...only Bart Bonte does it right!  I try not to let myself do too many levels at once, just so I can extend the game. I can\'t wait for the next color!',
       'This game and yellow have single handedly improved my relationship with my niece. She loves playing these games over and over every time she comes to visit. Christmas day she didn\'t want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.',
       'By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another "Yellow 2", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)',
       'Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I\'m familiar with Bart\'s mind by now. &lt;3 I think it\'s great that clues are available though and that they don\'t give everything away right away. It\'s a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!',
       'Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bart Bonte! I\'ve been waiting for a very, very long time for this game to come out since I first played "Yellow". Thanks a lot! But here are a few other questions I have for you: what will be the next game? How long will I have to wait until the next game comes out? Could you at least give me a hint? Thanks!' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ],

     [ 'Great game, no build waiting times, lots of strategy, a mix of tower defense and rts. Really is a game with a lot of effort put into it from non greedy devs. Well created hiker games. One small point that a future update could sort out is making a feature to create the same bandits again. Rather than manually going in and picking them again. And if you have spares, to automatically put them in place. Also duplicates seem to have no purpose as of yet....',
       'At first I got a clash of clan type vibe due to some mechanic like throphies and graphics. But the game is widely different and in a fresh new way. It\'s basically tower defense where you play both the defender and attacker roles which is done very well.',
       'Love mini games, also building tokens to obtain chests... please keep updates coming! And would love to zoom in more but I dig the overall quality of the game... when can I use my convoy to attack towns and castles?!?! Later on in the game?? Thanks!! And I would buy more gems if the price was reduced... fyi',
       'This game is  great and is very addictive. The gameplay is smooth and battles are amazing. The only problem that I face is that it never matches me with people with same power in ambush mode.Most of the convoys are always powerful than me. Please do something on this issue',
       'Very interesting game!  However I\'ve run into a bug where I can\'t build the building that stocks gold, and am therefore stuck not being able to further improve my buildings. Otherwise all good!  Thank you for reaching out, I contacted the team by email and it was sorted, brilliant customer service!',
       'Since the last update (25.02.2018.) my screen get\'s frozen at the very beginning (at preview of Hiker Games logo), can\'t play :( otherwise awesome game.  EDIT: they helped me fix the game, thank you! Love the game!' ],

     [ 'It probably doesnt mean much after all my complaining but this really is so much better now. 5 pvp bars to fill based on damage dealt to opponent. You dont even have to win anymore! You can now still boost your deck even if you cant afford to pay too much (I pay for cheaper offers whenever i can). Thanks so much for listening to everyone and making this game great! Keep it up guys! Nice job!',
       'Fun game! Update is great. It\'s easier to grind towards those PvP cards when you can still make some progress even when losing a match.  Those who say it\'s now 5 wins for a pack haven\'t played the update. It\'s 5 phones destroyed , or 5 life bars taken. So if you lose a sudden death match where you\'ve taken 2 of your opponent\'s life bars, you still get 2 \'wins\' towards a PvP reward. You can lose 3 times and get the cards. You don\'t have to win 3 which can be hard with all the cheaters you encounter.',
       'I want to give this five stars as I really enjoy the gameplay and I\'m practically addicted to it. The update has made PvP overall more fun for me as there is less pressure to win, so everyone still gets something out of it whether they win or lose, which I\'m happy for. However demanding so much storage space on my phone makes it unplayable even after deleting most of my other apps, music, and photos. I really want to keep playing and this seems to be an issue with other users too. I hope this gets fixed soon',
       'Broken phone idea. Good But the PvP pairing needs looked at.  Glitches where health jumps back up on characters when no spells cast at all. Really pissed off that PvP is either the opponent does nothing or you can\'t even get to the other player and I\'ve tried different decks',
       'Lag still in new update. R u running 4k graphics when you mostly on phone or tablet? hate how you want to drag a card but lag doesn\'t play it and you loose. There are plently of games with quicker response times and equal in appearance graphics. Lame 5 game PvP. How does the leveling even work? Too big gap in skills of opponents.',
       'Was on board since release, fan of the content. I wish the game was good; and that it was getting better but Devs have decided to take their game in a different direction. If you want to win bring lots of $$$$ and then pay some more $$$$ when they nerf your cards in a couple months or cheat, I guess, they don\'t give af' ],

     [ 'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',

My favorite"ZEUS SLOTS". Not fair, I\'m not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is" WILD STARS"  . However, "ZEUS" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.',
       'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!',
       'People are losing alot of money in this. This game no fun no more. And all u say are im sorry to hear....blablabla....it is imposibble to win and when we win some we lose a alot. Huuge dont care about our complain as long they make money. More player hurts, more player lose, they just dont care as long peoples make them income. Very very bad game.' ],

       'The game really very good.. it really liked concept nd i play it for hours.. but after unlocking paris I am facing difficulty to complete the levels.. even though i play efficiently some levels just cant be completed they require special add ons or purchases.. this makes game frustrating..even after giving my best i am not able to complete levels.. if its due to any error plz correct it asap otherwise i have to delete it coz i cant go any further in this game with this nd its frustrating me.. thank u',

       'It\'s a good game don\'t get me wrong but even though you\'ve upgraded things fully you still need to use the spoons to complete certain levels which dose not make sense unless they want you to spend your money to go further. Good game but you can only go so far without spending real money.',
       'Its a great game with good controls but the amount of real money you have to spend is just astronomically bad. I dont mind spending a few bucks a week to get through a lvl been stuck on for a while but this game is money sticky and it would seem no matter what stratergy you use just cant to seem to swing it....annoying',
       'Good game been playing it everyday for a few months. Ive been getting the daily bonus but what is annoying is when you get to day 7 the next days bonus is back to day 1. Why not continue with day 8 then day 9 and so on. Getting better things the longer you keep coming back.......😔' ],

     [ 'Simply wonderful app!! My daughter\'s speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it\'s repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn\'t get enough of it! Now we\'ve moved on to shapes and colours that she\'s working through now at 22months. It\'s truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where \'Z\' sounds out as \'Zed.\'',
       'I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!',
       'A great app love the fact that they included games for the parent LOL  I would like a continuous flow though instead of having to press the forward button every time  you\'re done with one segment',
       'Well I can\'t give 5* till I fully know,but my four yr old loves,it she\'s left handed, and has some problems with some words,so this helps with that,so I think its a great app so far',
       'Thank you very much for making this app available without any advertising or in app purchases, and also allowing it to store on my sd card so as to save my phones internal resources.  It is very much appreciated.',
       'Awesome app! The games are fun and straightforward, the characters are cute and the music is enjoyable. Lots of smart accessibility features for parents, too.' ],

Pretty good app. Challenges are obviously based on bankroll making it more of a player\'s game instead of a winner\'s game because poker is not a winner\'s game. Long play on shootout can be annoying but why you buying in at 2k? You get to play daily if you like to play for free and can even complete challenges when you went bust.',

If you contact support they just send out a form email stating that "Help is on the way..." but they will not fix the issue of bots.

The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'From beginning to end I\'ve been pleasantly surprised and let down but mainly let down. I was all for this game when it came out but now you wanna make a quick buck on a scenario app... pay more for something that should be part of the game. Overall good game business practices not so much.',

       'Quite an enjoyable game and different to games I normally play.  It is a strategy game were you have to try and create a deadly virus and wipe out the world, before the scientists find a cure.  What makes this game different is that instead of trying to save the human race, you try to destroy it.   Just a good job it isn\'t real.' ],

     [ 'Game is great despite the over long adverts. However on every device I have played it on (smartphones and tablets) it flattens the battery in double time. It seems to hog the cpu which gets warm on each device I\'ve played it on. Anyone else have this problem?  When exiting the game I have to go to the device settings and clear the ram to stop the battery draining and the cpu getting hot. Seems to crash a lot too!',
       'Slightly better after latest updates but still not as enjoyable to play as it was before the major update last year. Glitchy, slow to start and to play. Constantly disconnects from network and having to log back in to facebook all the time is annoying. Can be a real chore to play. Might try and persuade my regular opponents to switch to another version. Jan 2018 update - EA, I\'m a balding 46 year old man - why are you constantly showing me ads for Pantene?',
       'Possibly the worst app I have ever used. Memory hungry, battery draining - the phone actually gets hot! - and you are held to ransom by endless boring repetitive ads, or you pay through the nose to avoid them. But it\'s Scrabble, a great game, so what can you do? You learn to ignore the ads.    Too many silly words are allowed these days, so it\'s easier to play, but it remains a great game despite the shortcomings of this due app. But there are far too many adverts.',
       'Would be 5 stars if I could lose the ads I can deal with ads you can shut off... Having to watch a video is ridiculous. Rather pay a fiver for the app than watch a gin advert 50 times Oh and why is pilates not in the dictionary? It\'s in Collins online?',
       'Overall, I would not download this game for the following reasons.  Firstly, how come so many words are not recognized? Seriously, June is not a valid word, so are there only 11 months in the year then? However, words like upta do!   Secondly, this app drains battery life as though is using your phone to power a planet. You need to invest in your own power station, if you want to play this game for 10 -15 min sessions.  Thirdly, even for a free app there are too many adverts. I actually forgot I was playing a game and was about to open a bag of popcorn for the feature movie to begin.  Will be uninstalling now.',
       'Forget the ads, the app is very annoying. Its is plagued with connectivity issues. Ads loads first (at the bottom) before your pending Scrabble games is updated...and that is IF the game lists updates without resulting in network error. Often, it will need repeated restarts to update the list or starting a new random online game to force it.  I cannot recommend this app to first timers because it is frustrating. The Scrabble game cannot be enjoyed as EVERYTHING must be online...even Solo play. Look elsewhere until issues are addressed.' ],

When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can\'t wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It\'s a request. My problems are not solved.',
       'This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.',
       'Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss',
       'Best game I\'ve ever played! In fact it is the only game I\'ve had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn\'t sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks',
       'It\'s a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can\'t find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.',
       'I don\'t understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed.' ],

About the ads: I have premium, and I only have to watch an ad if I choose to get a reward in return. There are no sudde, unwanted or random ads anymore.',
       'Simple game. Ads galore. Also when ads pop up better not be listening to music because it\'s gonna pause your music even if the ad has 0 sound. Thus the one star rating. You can advertise all you want but don\'t interrupt any background apps to force me to look at your ad. That\'s just messed up.',
       'This game totally sucks like most of the other reviewers said. Nothing but forced ads with NO reward or compensation for our time and intelligence. And it lacks any originality. It\'s just another stupid boring merger game like the thousands before it. On a fun scale of 1 to 10, this game is a 0 for all the ads and unoriginality. It was a free game, but I want my money and time and intelligence back.',
       'First of all the game it self is a great little game. Graphics are fine game play is simple and easy to pick up it\'s a good game. Now for the reason it only gets two stars. WAY TO MANY ADS! I mean for f@$k sake every two seconds there\'s an ad. Click on the car buying button there\'s an ad. Sit there to long there\'s an ad. I understand this is how you make your money but come on there\'s a line and you didn\'t just cross it you swan dived over that bad boy. I\'m sorry but I do not recommended this game for anyone.',
       'Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there\'s a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.',
       'Far too many ads. And being forced to watch a 30 sec ad before continuing! Sorry, uninstalling. Try banner ads only, and I will play this game for ages. Now you won\'t make any more money out of me. Also, look at the reviews, you obviously haven\'t got a clue about what irritates people.' ],

I had this same discussion today about another game. If there are purchased items, I need you to reverse these purchases. I don\'t have money like that. It\'s not like I\'m winning actual cash. I won\'t touch anything that looks suspiciously like it has a price tag attached and hidden. Therefore, you can reverse it. It\'s just sitting there untouched. Wether it costs or not. If there are any purchases attached to my name, and land on my bill for the month of April of 2018. I will promptly uninstall this game. I choose the free games with good reason. I will Never purchase anything from any mobile games. Ever, Seriously.',
       'This game is still a cheating stealing money hungry piece of garbage. Not like a casino AT ALL. i again saved 80 mil in credits all day to watch them take it away without a win in less than 3 minutes trying to play challenges. Always the same. Update u just did it again, i saved up 40 mil credits to play challenges and u stole in 2 minutes. U thieves!!!!.again today saved up credits u stole in 1 minute. 53 mil.',

The game ruined 2 relationships and one marriage and my sole sibling, my older brother still isn\'t on my people I\'ll talk to list because he pressed MY spin button costing me what I can only my imagine was zillions of dollars. So now I play the slots here. Partly because I\'m no longer allowed in Vegas Casinos and also I\'m under house arrest. This game cost me my life. 5 stars.',

     [ 'Controls are terrible. Doesn\'t feel natural at all. Have to pay for every park/spot other than the starter park which sucks. Just pay the $1.99 for True Skate. Way better game with more natural feel for the controls and bigger parks/bettter spots. It\'s like going from Tony Hawk Pro Skater to EA\'s Skate series. Give us at least better controls to make this feel better. Fluck it. Not pick up finger to ollie which doesnt even work %80 of the time.',
       'Would be better if you could Manuel between tricks  and if the tricks were in combo with other instead of individually named. Also can\'t seem to feeble, or smith grind:/ Fakie seems to not be working for me, it just registers at regular even though I\'m clearly riding fakie! Also I\'ve paid for this game and haven\'t seen a new park in the past year and the map The Docks sucks!!',
       'Spent literally hundreds of hours playing this when I had an iPhone, it was the best mobile game of all time.. Then I switched to android, and waited forever for it to be ported to android. I was so happy when I found out it had eventually made it\'s way to the play store, downloaded it immediately and bought all of the parks. Then I realised it didn\'t have the option to replay clips or edit them like the iPhone version does. This has ruined the game.. One of the best features was the ability to watch back a line you have spent hours perfecting, edit the clip and share it. PLEASE judt add the ability to replay and edit clips on android like you can do on iPhone and make it the greatest game of all time again.',
       'Needs some fixes. It\'s EXTREMELY annoying when I go to do a nose or tail slide, the game does a boardalide. Even if I\'m blatantly placing my fingers in the right spots on the screen. How do I unlock "Skate". Needs more designs. Better customization.  Also needs to recognize more tricks.  Along with already existing ones to be better portrayed. Should add a mode where the board is essentially floating. So that one may be able to flip the board without wipe out to see how to do a specific trick. Game is fun though.',
       'Awesome game it\'s so fun and like real life skating I use to play this game along time ago when It had the horrible camera angle and it has improved a lot. It\'s not hard to control either. The one thing I didn\'t like was that there is no replay! If you could replay truck it would be perfect',
       'It\'s an amazing game! I also have a suggestion. For tricks, like the ollie and kickflip, it should matter where your feet (Fingers) are, so if your going for a kickflip, you should have your foot higher up on the board and for doubles and triples, your foot should be farther down. I know it\'s quite large and some people may not like it, but it would add more realistic gameplay.  Edit: Also some different trucks would be nice, and also if it had grind marks.  Also you should add user challenges and maps, I know this would be a huge update to make but I know it would make the game so much better.' ],

Otherwise enjoyable.',
       'This game favors the higher level players or those willing to pay. You\'ll get top level 5 or 6 and get attacked by someone at least twice your level and lose all your resources. It\'ll take days for your forces to be healed cause it takes resources to heal them, which were stolen. Anyone you attack won\'t have much resources for you to steal cause they\'ve either given up on the frame or too low of a level to have anything, so it\'s a huge waste of time. You can get a shield, but you have to buy what you can\'t get for free. It\'s a shame cause it\'s an okay game.',

     [ 'I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don\'t reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie\'s handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.',
       'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It\'s pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I\'m sure I\'m not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it\'s a great game.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.',
       'The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It\'s the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator\'s cost 100 coins while Dune It Up\'s cost 1000-2000?' ],

     [ 'This game is a game I can proudly say I will never delete. I hadn\'t played this game for very long but I have loved it so much. The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It\'s never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.',
       'This game has been amazing since early-access. I  have loved it for a long time and will still love it for a long time. One suggestion though. It would be cool if one could emote inside the van once you have got away or have been arrested',
       'Excellent game. Highly replayable. Fun and challenging. My only issue is that emotes switch from one side to the other when playing as a thief vs playing as a sniper. Plus, having to hit a button to fire vs just hitting the right side of the screen is a bit more difficult. Otherwise, almost perfect game.',
       'It\'s really fun, has some great mechanics that aren\'t very common among mobile games, and it is simple to play. But there is one problem I have, which takes place as theif. Sometimes, as I am about to duck down behind cover, there is a short time frame where the sniper is able to hit you even though you are behind the cover. This is for the full covers, not the breakable or the half. They can also sometimes hit you when you are at the full covers, which I hate. The only time I get mad when I die in this game is when the sniper is able to shoot me while I am in full cover or within that short time frame.',
       'Love. It. Been here since alpha. Amazing game. Addictive  Classic and orginal.Edit: this gane is way different than what it used to be. First it is really hard to earn alot of money in one go of a match. Also why cant we gain experincw after a match instead of having to pay. The price to upgrade gadgets is way to overpriced. And u lose money too fast.theifs earn little money  Plz reply and reflect on what i said',
       'I like the game but when I try to run somewhere as the thief the game usually starts glitching and my thief starts teleporting in all sorts of directions. This simply makes the game unplayable for me which is a shame because I really liked it.' ],

     [ 'Awesome classic and how a port should be done.  The controls are wonderful, its great using all my gamepads to play. I love how all these great ports to android support that. Playing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, and Sonic CD all with gamepad. Tested on and working great on my Note 3, Note 8 Tablet, Pixel XL, and on Zidoo x10 . Edit: I formatted my phone , i reinstalled the game, clicked on restore purchase, but it takes me to an item not found. 1 star rating until I can restore my purchase, or at least access to a paid version again. Will rate back to 5 when I can play ad free again. Edit2: I found the way to fix restore purchase. Don\'t click restore purchase, just click on buy ad free, and it says it\'s restored and does not re-charge for payment.',
       'I only have negative reviews because untried purchasing this game through the app THREE TIMES.  I still do not have the ad free version.  Please contact me, I purchased the full version so my daughter can have access to all levels, and I still have the ad supported version.   I\'m even willing to pay for it again (so my daughter can have fun) please help me Sega.',
       '4 stars because i dont know how to play as tails/knuckles. EDIT: This game, I\'m starting to get nostalgia, and also, this game brings back the amazing cheat.... DEBUG MODE!!! #SegaIsTheBest EDIT 2: Changed to 5 stars cause I learned to do Sonic & Tails and play as Tails/Knuckles',
       'Hi there my nephew downloaded this game and he purchased a few things on here without my consent. I\'m disappointed because it didn\'t ask him for permission as thus is a kids game it should have parental permission before buy items on her.  I would like a refund of all my money the ks',
       'I agree the controls are really difficult. I played this game when it first came to the us via the Sega Genesis and those controls were way better. If you truly want to play this game right get one of those joystick accessories, otherwise good luck. It seems to go okay in the levels but beating Robotnic is much, much harder.',
       'Installed the game on my chomebook. I was told that it should work fine on it. After installing it, and watching one of the ads...I couldn\'t continue. Tried relaunching a few times to get it to work...Not worth my time, or money to unlock.' ],

The concept of the game is simple - you’ve got a box of gems, and your only objective is to match and merge them to make them as splendid as possible. Every so often, you’ll be gifted a new gem - and the faster you tap on box at the bottom of the screen, the faster the gems will appear. Each gem that appears on the board can be merged with other gems of the same kind to form a greater gem - the bigger, the shinier the gem, the more currency you will earn. And the more currency you earn, the more gems you can purchase in the game store! Use your winnings to discover all sorts of new gems, and expand into new areas. All you have to do is make your gem collection the best it can be. The bar at the top of the screen measures the quality of your collection - merge gems to earn XP and level up. Higher levels will unlock more space to grow your collection - the more space you have, the more impressive your collection can become. Once you move into new areas, make sure to keep an eye on all of your collections, ensuring that you’re merging and growing them to their full potential. Merge, grow, and sparkle with Merge Gems!',

The game looks much better, color schemes are sharp too. Great job development team. Kudos to all of you. Thank You..It\'s awesome. 😊',
       'Please fix the bugs my player id was showing double times in alliance and I can\'t even use free attacks by watching ads and iam unable to get free rubs by watching ads and when I uninstall the app and reinstall it. it is automatically thrown out of alliance so many bugs worst update ever',
       'Awesome game!! Needs to be a bit easier to gain/find/aquire chest keys and cosumables to evolve. As is now ..the process of evolution of player/weapons/armor gets a bit dragged out and a bit confusing... Either way I love the game concidering Im not into role playing ones... Please ..if you (the developers...a.k.a. Masterminds of this game) are updating/upgrading this game..it works out much better to be more action less RPG.',

I recently gave you a glowing review but this is not good. I tried signing up for a customer account to talk to your team and my email is not accepted. What gives? Please fix this and I will happily rewrite my review',

ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it\'s a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz',

I enjoy playing it but I get the feeling very soon I will have to spend some real pennies and when that happens I will probably stop playing.',
       'Not completely sold on the game. Major problem: hoarfrost was not designed for touchscreen! Trying to clear the frost moves the screen, pulls down drop down menu from the top, pauses repeatedly, zooms & unzooms repeatedly...nightmare! Game has too much going on with collections, story, various games....to enjoy the game. I like the parts where I find stuff. The rest just gets in the way and bores me.',

I had problems when you updated it before and in the end had a new phone started again and now this problem. Why does problems happen when you do and update. I have got to a good level again and I really don\'t want to start again. It\'s a shame as I really think this is or was the best game I\'ve played.  Please sort it',
       'Good game and great entertainment so far, been playing for about 10 days. Some levels challenging but not enough to be discouraging. Good way to develop focus, observation and memory. Those rubies are hard to get though and expensive in real money...',

I love how entertaining it is, but i hit two jackpots and never got my.money soo thats very very frustrating...i should have a trillion dollars but because i was rooked out of my jackpot wins i honestly may uninstall. I emailed them about it and no one ever got back to me...this is sad because i really love this game. Oh well.',
       'Well ive played for such along time but ive never got the top money on the spin wheel ever and on the spin wheel you have multiple amounts the same dollar figure so you end up landing on one of the same dollar amounts , you need to give us better odds right there.  So i give a 51% pass mark because of those reasons only. PS - CHANGE ALL THE DOLLAR FIGURES ON THE MONEY WHEEL AND EVERY SO OFTEN LET US WIN THE MAJOR DOLLAR ON IT . CAUSE AT ATM YOU NEVER WIN IT.',

Top of my favourites ,daily plays.   Trying very very hard to quit before my chips are gone. Ahead right now and will try to conserve for another time. Will be telling others about this Casino styled game that I enjoy immensely. Just Love this game. Spectacular!!!!!!!!!      y',

     [ 'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ],

     [ 'Lots of fun and challenging trying to find the best placement for a word to maximize your score.   The one objection I have relates to the dictionary.  When checking a word\'s meaning in the dictionary that any opponent played, and I don\'t recognize,  the dictionary will sometimes say that it is an acceptable word for Words with Friends, but no definition is available at this time.  I believe that when playing a game having to do with vocabulary, no word that does not have a dictionary definition should be allowed!  What determines if it is a legitimate  word if not found in a dictionary?',
       'Have been playing for years and the enhancements keep improving it. This is not Scrabble. It\'s a different game wth its own features. Use those features and enjoy. It\'s hard enough to earn coins to make use of the features a rarity rather than the norm. And Word Strength (always available) is great - you can just accept your lower value word or challenge yourself to work even harder to find a better one. It\'s a great game - especially as once you\'ve had a go, you can leave it for hours (or days!) and only play when you have time. 😊',
       'Good gameplay. I enjoy playing this game. Great for expanding vocabulary. However, too many words that are acceptable without definitions. Should be a way to submit definitions for words, or maybe link with a dictionary app. Additionally, what\'s with the ads after every move? I end up closing game and restarting, it\'s quicker than watching the ads. If they where shorter, I would let them play.',
       'Good game. Only problem there are games that left for 16 + days and you can\'t get rid of them. Even when you nudge the person ... nothing happens. This impacts on starting new games with those who want to play! Please sort this out. Ads too long in version 2. Would rate better if this was sorted.',
       'I\'m no longer getting my bonus points playing the challenger of the day.  I\'m owed hundreds of coins. Also, there is a lot if different words that are playable and unplayable versus the original sctabble board game. There are several editions of scrabble dictionaries that you could update with. Other then that this is a pretty entertaining game.',
       'I really enjoy playing with my friends, just another way to keep in touch even though you\'re miles away! You can also meet and play new folks, as well as play all of the various challenges the game has to offer while you are playing. For example, you earn coins for different words played, difficulty of words played, or words with certain letters. If you enjoy just playing to play or playing for a challenge, this game has it all!' ],

     [ 'I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I\'ve hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it\'s all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn\'t immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It\'s very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!',
       'Like almost everyone else on here I loved this game until recently.  Like tonight for instance I was playing mostly the 7s slots.  In less than an hour betting at $120,000 to 180,000 max I went thru 45 million coins!!! I mean COME ON!!!  At the beginning when the payouts are generous I didn\'t mind purchasing coins,  tickets,  etc... But now forget it not going to spend one more dollar on this game.',
       'Used to be fun to play when there were decent rewards. For some reason the comp room rewards are gone besides small discount options. Ticket rewards are available for shows nobody would want to pay to see.  I have been playing for a few years now and have saved up quite few loyalty points. I guess we are playing for an occasional comp buffet. What a shame',
       'Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I\'ve been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it\'s not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it\'s supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it\'s just a game, it\'s for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that\'s not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?',
       'Great game at first but when you progress you pretty much play for 10 minutes wait for bonus. Started purchasing chips and then they seem to go quicker! I like that is not all win win but damn, throw a dog a bone every once in a while. Basically you throw money away paying for chips and NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER win!',
       'I\'m sick of only being able to play for ten minutes at a time. Would love this game more if I can actually play it but you hardly can win coins, and if you do it\'s a quarter of what you spent on spinning it, and can hardly get coins. If you had more ways to get extra coins rather than paying like watching an ad, or something then that would be cool. Or if they made it so one could not lose 500k in ten minutes while only winning a total of like 5k that would be great cuz I would actually then enjoy it.' ],

     [ 'This game is amazing, it really helps with stress, anxiety and just any and all negative emotions. With its calm, relaxing music and adorible graphics, this well thought out game is the perfect way to releave stress. I really recommend downloading this game, trust me, you\'ll love it!!!😁',
       'Very relaxing. I fell asleep playing this game. Though it\'s a bit addictive, so I don\'t like playing during the day. Another problem is that saving and loading the game between devices from the cloud are a bit confusing. There is no explanation and I haven\'t gotten it to work.',
       'PLEASE DON\'T IGNORE...I need help, there appears to be a glitched achievement and it\'s driving me insane. I wish not to be intrusive  about it but my Ocd\'s  preventing me from continuing on thinking I will not be getting the other achievements. It\'s the Disiplined V, which is the 4000 for the virtues, I unlocked the virtue but not the achievement . I even reset my oasis twice and nothing',
       'Honestly I am quite disgusted at how many 1 star ratings there are. I agree it\'s boring, HOWEVER, only in some cases. I don\'t play for fun like I guess what most of the 1 star ratings are for. Its not meant to be played for fun but meant to try to calm down or relieve stress for anyone playing it. If you\'re playing for the sake of fun then yes it will be boring. DO NOT download this game if you are seeking something to entertain you. It is boring for me when I play like that. However if you play to try to find a way to calm yourself down, say you need something to distract you, it will really work. The game really works for me when I am in a mental breakdown or feeling extremely suicidal. Playing My Oasis in those state of minds has helped me to calm down instead of acting on suicidal thoughts. This game has also helped my older brother when he has a breakdowns as well because of his depression. This game IS a tap game but it is not pointless if you play the game for the reason you\'re supposed to play it for, which is to relax/calm down.',
       'I really like this game, but I\'m giving it one star until they fix it. I have the auto cumulation for all the traits, but it\'s about a 30% chance it works. If I don\'t go in within the 24 hour mark (or I upgrade anything a good amount), it cuts my gains and makes it like I earned nothing. So, love this game, but until the bug is fixed, it\'s getting 1 star. It\'s really irritating I need to go through this after also sending them an email on what\'s going on.',
       'This is a great game. And I\'ve learned something from it. My lion told me,  "Don\'t judge yourself on what others do to you".  I think he said that. But it made my heart feel better. I\'ve always judged myself lile that, but now I feel as if it\'s all okay. I feel better.    I really like this game because one, I love nature, two, I love animals, and three, these animals are so nice on what they say and it makes you feel better.  EVERYBODY SHOULD GET THIS. EVEN IF TOU DONT NEED IT.  STILL GET IT LOL  And for those of you who think it\'s just an old tapping game, you\'re right and you\'re WRONG. You\'re right because, yeah, you do tap a lot. You\'re wrong because you not supposed to jam your finger on the screen and do it super fast. It\'s basically optional to do so. Tapping only gives you more points. So how about you folks calm down and rethink this... And just STOP. All of this COMPLAINTMENT. OH, IT\'S THEN END OF THE WORLD BECAUSE I DIDN\'T GET WHAT I WANTED. IT\'S THE END OF THE WORLD BECAUSE I CAN\'T RETHINK ANYTHING AND I\'M JUST GONNA FREAK OUT OVER A SMALL GAME!!!  It\'s a game genius. Get used to it. -.-' ],

     [ 'I\'m loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don\'t change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can\'t go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. I like the breakable rear lights on some of the cars. Maybe add deflatable tires? Very good game all in all',
       'Kept telling me that I was going the wrong way even though I was going the right way while racing. Which then it puts you in last place. So, I\'m uninstalling this game because it\'s frustrating to be winning a race and a design flaw ruins the game for me. Also, giving more camera angles would be nice for the other players not uninstalling this game like I am right now☠☠☠☠',
       'Need a 67 Shelby mustang gt 500 fastback "Eleanor". Also needs a hand brake for sharp turns and drifting and maybe an inside view with steering wheel and stick shift. Very fun and addicting game. Great job here. Multi-player would be cool too.',
       'This game is awsome!  Controls and graphics can be a little laggy,  but the large amount of tracks and cars to unlock and play around with makes up for it. My favorite car is the Duke Wagon Classic, nitro-charged, with a v-8 dropped into it.  Will kick butt in any race or derby! My only suggestion would be on the physics of the cars... Instead of having the bodies simply crush and get smaller/deformed, it would be cool to see body panels and  small pieces like lights and mirrors fall right off. Just a thought. Also it would be cool to have more big station wagon type cars.',
       'This game is really fun and additive I play it EVERYDAY. This game is by far the best demolition derby game I,ve  played. For my free car I would like a lykan hypersport please!!! ;-) If you do not know what it is please look it up and please try to make it they are really cool, fast, and exotic cars. If not I would like tank. Thank you for reading.',
       'I had loved this game until it stopped saving my car purchases. Like my last  one the pick up that looks exactly like a 80s chevy with the cap off and roll cage. I put 7.0 motor in it with NOS tires and paint. Went in this morning it was gone. Please fix.Norton also says you\'re monitoring my location how obtrusive you dushbags.' ],

     [ 'If you don\'t continue to buy skills or bags in the game they will cheat you and make you lose. But constantly asking me to buy something is annoying. Also, good graphics but control are not good enough. It malfunctions and player with bad connection has advantage and wins game and money.  That\'s problematic.',
       'The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It\'s so obvious a money grab for mini games, it\'s sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you\'ll have to beat anyone. That\'s why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren\'t any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.',
       'Rigged,when you have clearly beaten the block attempt in challenge mode,your shot gets blocked or when you make a move the opponent steals,when you try the same it doesn\'t work. Fix this then the game would be better.',
       'I liked the game more personally before the recent update. I have a newer phone & since game play mostly in shooting basket race is glitchy, along with buying things on the app, I hate that you can only have room for so many bags it makes it me want to stop playing after a bit. I can see waiting 15 min, 30, 45min, maybe an hour but not up to 12 hours. I used to like being able to buy the standard bag for old gold bar gave me something to look forward too if I won gold in a match.',
       'I really like this one. Sometimes the game cheats. But since the last update that seems to be happening less. Update: What happened to my premium clothes? The game changed my look!!! Update: I like the update. Need easier way to get skills. Suggestion: get skills during game play, not just in bags.',
       'Fuxk this please dont waste time on here.. get and other or go play by yourself by ..... 🍌🍌🍌so many bugss actually when you throw the ball in basket when its near basket. They say you got blocked now wtf is this..alot of waste time.' ],

Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn\'t have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer',
       'So, far really love to play. I only just started though. The controls are hard but that\'s probably because I\'m playing on a tablet and I got small hands. Unfortunately, I don\'t think I\'ll be able to continue playing this. For some reason it makes my tablet terrifyingly hot to the point I\'m concerned. I\'ll hold on to the app for now in case it gets better in the future.',
       'An amazing mmo that really does a great job of handling farming, the game play although has an auto feature still utilizes the controls. The depth of all the items and armor and weapons is awesome. I\'ve been really happy playing this game. The clans are great. The 30 vs 30 opensiege is a nice feature. This game is super fun even for the people that want to play for free. Netmarble does a great job with daily rewards, login bonuses, and events that all allow for players to get great items for free!! Best game I\'ve played in a long while. Only thing is constant crashes and bad story line. The game keeps me turning it back on and I haven\'t went one day without logging in.',
       'Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don\'t have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well. I play with my monitor using SideSync for full screen awesomeness. There is a lot to do for all types of players, being in a guild doing dungeons reminds me of the old-school MMORPGs of sieging and doing weekly raids.',
       'The game had me hooked as I spent a week trying to find a character and job class I liked. Keep in mind that you will be doing a lot of grinding, but leveling is not surprisingly unreasonable.  There are some aspects that will make you believe you have to pay to win, but it is not necessary. Although it would be cool to help the devs or too. All in all love the game and can\'t seem to put it down ( I let it auto-grind while I live my life. Haha).',
       'Everything about this game is really good, but since this update today I can\'t even open the game it keeps closes and sending me to my home screen on my phone... Doesn\'t give me a error report or any messages just closes the app. Id really like to continue playing please fix . Galaxy S8+' ],

     [ 'I play the game all the time, but it needs easier and faster prestige. Three days of waiting for the next egg is bs with a prestige score of almost 1,000,000. Also "silos" hardly earn anything. That\'s my main complaint. Fix it so they earn WAY more over non play or I\'m done and I\'ve actually spent money so if you still want that, fix it.',
       'Fun and simple game that lets you gradually grow your farm at your own speed. This is a game you can play from once a week where you collect the money you\'ve collected offline, buy upgrades, then leave the game for another week; to spending a few casual hours of hunting for the drones that give you extra money and gold eggs which are the games micro-transaction currency to buy permanent upgrades that help your farm grow faster. It not so much a race as it is just enjoying your farm steadily grow over time.',
       'Edit: Latest update is thoroughly average. Some great new tools and really cool upgrades mixed in with ridiculously boring time sink achievements. They breathed new life into the game and then stuffed it up and made me sit around for 20 actual real life days for each egg waiting for a chicken counter to reach a billion. Such a shame.  I like big numbers and Egg Inc. delivers in spades. Click and hold functionality, strategic planning and approachable mission targets; one of the best in the genre.',
       'My only complaint is when is that everything you tap opens a menu. So if you were to try to hit a drone and accidentally tap the housing it opens that menu and you can\'t close it fast enough to still get the drone. I think there should just be a single or couple small menu buttons that allow you to cycle through the different things you can purchase to avoid this. Other than that great game! It\'s entertaining to have 100 million chickens in your pocket.',
       'The graphic are great and the gameplay is fun but what kept me going was the writing. At first I was like uhhh another newspaper? Those don\'t do anything... But I kept reading and they are GREAT. On the lower side, the drones often clip in building and can\'t be clicked or you click straight on it but get sent to a building screen instead and by the time you get back, the fast drones are gone.',
       'It would be better if it supported the screen ratio on my galaxy note 8. Also it lags a little on this phone. It would also be good if there were one-touch upgrades on transport/habs so I don\'t have to deal with a second menu and get more banked golden eggs.' ],

     [ 'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Awful controls, heavily focused on buying coins & watching ads just to play matches. Not recommended!',
       'This game is good. You should try to make it a lot more like golf with friends (the Steam game). Try to make the graphics look more detailed and better. Add more maps too.',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

     [ 'It\'s a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I\'m not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It\'s a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don\'t mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It\'s the price you pay to get a good, free game. It\'s not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.',
       'I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I\'m going to try another app now.',
       'I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn\'t like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.',
       'It won\'t allow me to add my own pic for background. Maybe too big of a file but I know other solitare let me. I also wish there wasn\'t commercials after the win or lose because they interrupt my music but I hear you guys make money that way so let it be. I\'ll continue to play because I like solitare and the commercials only pause my music and don\'t cut it completely off to play the commercial, like other apps.',
       'Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.' ],

     [ 'Overall... I\'d have to say it\'s a very basic game and I wish there was more to it. I have always loved the Simpson\'s and playing a game based on their life is surely interesting. However, I was hoping that it would be more realistic, fun and free. It turns out that it\'s a P2P game and that took my surprise because it really is unfortunate. I hope they improve the gameplay and graphics. More updates will definitely bring more players.',

I\'m trying to get online more than I can play. For me this is frustrating and hilarious. I guess I will find a similar game and rater use my money and time there?',
       'Great game for Simpsons fans. But what kills the fun are constantly new side missions. Just as you finished one, two new shows up. You can never concentrate on what\'s most important and that\'s building the Springfield but rather playing with some ruffians at the time now.',
       'I used to give this a 5 star rating but at level 150 I maxed out the amount of items I can have in my Springfield. Playing the game at this stage is pretty useless. I\'m not a hoarder, my Springfield is beautifully arranged so there is no way I will delete things in order to build new houses or place new items. Will come back when the cap is increased but for now I\'m sadly forced to take a break.' ],

     [ 'Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It\'s best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it\'s been six months, and I\'m still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I\'ve only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.',
       'Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you\'re either going to have to pay lots of real money or you\'ll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!',
       'I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says "loading cantina" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!',
       'I played this on and off since it started but now I am back full-time and it has always been improving and growing. Big star wars fan and can\'t get enough of it? This is the next best thing. The game is very complex so I suggest if you are only starting out, check out starter guides on youtube on how to have the best head start  and enjoy! 🎉',
       'Really good game. I love games where you have to grind to get the best character with a slight bit of luck if you pull them. The only thing i would change is how long it takes to get your energy back as. I feel like when i run out i cant play the game gor a long time as it takes a lot of time to get your energy back. But overall would fully recommend',
       'The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How \'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I\'ll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people\'s personal info.' ],

With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, "puzzles".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).',

     [ 'It\'s a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don\'t take it seriously! I\'m not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that\'s just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!',
       'This is a great game... You should play it if you like gymnastics and if you are board,You   should download this game... Is very fun... I liked it... But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!',
       'I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the \'X\' button it shouldn\'t show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!',
       'This is from my daughter, "I like the game but there\'s some things about it I kind of don\'t understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she\'s practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot."   This is from me, "the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it\'s fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall."',
       'The main thing I didn\'t like about it is how little things you can do unless you spend like 10 bucks especially seeing as this is a game that looks like it\'s targeted towards children $10 is pretty expensive just to be able to play a gymnastics',
       'Really was enjoying this app, then about 10 minutes in video ads started popping in literally every 1 or 2 minutes. This totally killed the fun factor; not only was I unable to complete any tasks or just enjoy the game but the crummy ads actually kept booting me off the app. What a complete buzz kill; even tho this app was super cute & the graphics were total eye candy, the constant interruptions barging in were beyond ridiculous; both in longevity & frequency.' ],

Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'Waste of time. I started playing the game as an offer to get points for another game. Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I\'m promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won\'t play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'Too late to join this game. As soon as you lose your newbie protection you become a farm for higher level players, preventing you from progressing. Every morning you find all your resources pillaged and your troops dead or incapacitated. Maybe I\'m just in the wrong timezone.' ],

     [ 'So far the best, mostly free, slot game yet. I think a dollar for only one scratch ticket is a bit pricey I mean come on. It\'s only a game. This day and age. More for less, brings more, than less. I\'m not paying a real $1.00 for just 1 game coins scratcher. Otherwise far as for fun. Huuuge is the casino\'s and Slot\'s you should be playing. Definitely a boredom killer.',
       'I\'ve seen some pretty bad paywalls in games, it\'s to be expected...but this game takes it to a whole new level. First 10 minutes playing you will win every other spin, enter bonus games every couple of spins, and win win win..then the paywall. The final 100 plus spins netted me about 5 wins that at least broke even and absolutely 0 bonus spins or bonus games. Definitely not going to pay real money for a game that\'s this tight. Don\'t waste your time. Lots of other slot games that are balanced',
       'Good game when it\'s not crashing. Had it crash 6 times in 15 minutes. Huge payouts during bonus spins. Sitting on 85 Billion that I can spend due to stability issues. Fix this and I will rate the game higher. Playing on Galaxy S 8+.',

Any time I try to use the joystick it would go to another place on the screen, and other times would make my blob automatically go somewhere without me even using the joystick. If it is just my device making the game buggy then is it still possible to fix somehow? Please let me know.',

You\'re supposed to get free coins but about half the time you don\'t actually get it after you click the button. I wasted 90 coins and complete a quest and then I received nothing but it clearly thinks I completed the quest because I need to pay another 90 coins to get a new Quest. This is happen like half the time! Sometimes I get no XP for some reason. I don\'t know what happened to this game',
       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there.',

     [ 'Hello I\'ve been playing this game for months, so much so that I began to pay to play it. In October of 2017 I had a late payment that resulted in me loosing my VIP status. However; My bank account reflected withdrawals of 9.99 for game plays from October 2017 until January 2018. Google was able to give my money back for January but I have to now contact the Administration of this game in order to be reimbursed for previous months. I love playing this game but I will no longer pay to play anymore.  I will keep you all posted on my outcome.',
       'Decent amount of ads.  I sometimes have an issue where it suddenly stops accepting input. The game doesn\'t freeze, just can\'t do anything. I\'ve tried going to home screen and back and even turning my screen off and back on, nothing works.  Have to force close it. :(  this happens maybe 1 out of every 7 or 8 times I play.  Samsung note 8.   A "live" or else "play with a friend" type of feature would be cool.',
       'The game itself is very amazing in graphics and very creative. BUT as for the VIP membership, it\'s totally absurd that we have to pay $9.99 plus taxes monthly. I would be fine with it if it was $9.99 a year. Hope that this will change some day. I love playing this game. I play this EVERYDAY, even more than any other games. Please consider about changing the membership fee to yearly rather than monthly.',
       'the game does too many resets, all on its own. i can be in the middle of a game, and the game will stop in mid-stream, then start a new game, and causing me to lose not only what i have "won", but will set me all the way back to the bronze box, or, in the case of special games, such as the winter sports 2018, back to the red box, when i actually finished and won the silver medal. the game can be veeerrrrryyyy slooooooooow, and often is. i enjoy the show when i get a chance to watch it, but am not so sure about the game. it would also be nice if there were instructions on how to play the features that are *not* in the tv show...',
       'Game has been great for over a year! All of a sudden I\'m not able to play the "Happy Hour" "tickets in every box" bonus hours or even obtain the rewards. I contacted customer support and was advised to make sure the app was updated, clear my cache and restart my phone....didn\'t work!!!',
       'Loved the real show so decided to try it out  Usually I read reviews before I add games but didn\'t and I should have. Keeps freezing and stopping resulting in me losing when I\'m winning. Don\'t mind the ads so much. Tried the chat no response. Won\'t be keeping this which is sad to say because I actually like it.' ],

     [ 'Don\'t like games that only let you progress when coins come up. Just took 53 spins x max to reach level 4. No thanx will delete when coins are gone. If any thing second chance and it\'s more pathetic. Bye for the last time.',
       'Fun game! Lots of wins! Not realistic because in real life you can\'t win this much! Hate the bonus and extra games though, constantly spinning faster than normal but rarely ever stopping on bonus or free games',
       'Slots WOW, is a suitable name. Awsome variety  of cool, unique  slot games, where you win incredible  amt. coins in spins,Hugh wins also bonus games,with out betting your entire bank roll,yet wins are huge,free games are more common than in most casinos.Choose your challenge game.',
       'Pros:  It\'s enjoyable when u get something out of it for betting at Max, but doesn\'t always go well and you have to waste 5million or so till u get a Ultra Win and bonuses don\'t come very often unless u either auto or tap it urself and hope it lands on a bonus?   Cons:   Game resets and freezes and you lose either ur gems or another spin at the wheel and or specials that they give u by watching short videos. Doesn\'t always give it to you as like I said freezes or makes you have to close the app and restart all over again.',
       'Awesome wins and crazy awesome graphics. This is a game to entertain short or long down times. Once you start playing you almost cannot stop. Great job!',
       'Loved this game up because it gives a lot of freespins to continue playing without worrying to wait for bonuses to come up again.... and it\'s addictive that I had it installed in my 3 Samsung tablets and in my husband tablet lol😍😘😂' ],

     [ 'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn\'t notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile',
       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brain😀 anyway superr game excellent',
       'When i started the game first time... first it asked money to remove add...have some patience . If a persons likes your game he or she will definitely pay you ...it is like you are asking a guest money to enter your house... nonsense',
       'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',

    descriptionHTML: 'Join your friends in a brand new 5v5 MOBA showdown against real human opponents, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang! Choose your  favorite heroes and build the perfect team with your comrades-in-arms! 10-second matchmaking, 10-minute battles. Laning, jungling, tower rushing, team battles, all the fun of PC MOBAs and action games in the palm of your hand! Feed your eSports spirit!<br><br>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, 2017&#x2019;s brand new mobile eSports masterpiece. Shatter your opponents with the touch of your finger and claim the crown of strongest Challenger!<br><br>Your phone thirsts for battle!<br><br><b>Features:</b> <br><br><b>1. Classic MOBA Maps, 5v5 Battles</b> <br>Real-time 5v5 battles against real opponents. Fight over 3 lanes to take the enemy&#x2019;s tower. 4 jungle areas. 18 defense towers. 2 Wild Bosses. Complete reproductions of classic MOBA maps. Full-on 5v5, Human vs. Human battles. A triumphant return to genuine MOBA gameplay.<br><br><b>2. Win with Teamwork &amp; Strategy</b> <br>Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team or be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!<br><br><b>3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory</b> <br>Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Winners and losers are decided based on skill and ability on this fair and balanced platform for competitive gaming. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.<br><br><b>4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master</b> <br>With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target sifting allow you to last hit to your heart&#x2019;s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system lets you focus on the thrill of battle!<br><br><b>5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches</b> <br>Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds, and battles last 10 minutes, glossing over the quiet early-game leveling up and jumping right into intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling action and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.<br><br><b>6. Smart Offline AI Assistance</b> <br>In most MOBAs, a dropped connection means hanging your team out to dry, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&#x2019;s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you&#x2019;re offline, your character will be controlled by our AI system to avoid a 5-on-4 situation.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE!

     [ 'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'I gave the game another chance after my last review because the game is fun but it is my last time.. I am uninstalling and never again playing mlbb. I got afkers on my team in 4 consecutive classic games, and I still get feeders even though my rank is quite high.. why do I get paired up with feeders, I have no clue.  Goodbye mlbb, was great when I acually got a decent team and is actually capable of winning instead of having no chance at all and get trashtalked by opponents thinking they are all that.',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'I like the game. My low rating is because I had to reset my phone and now have to go 8 lvl again just to reload into my account. It\'s bad enough you are forced to play the practice modes over again but lvl 8 is almost to ranked again. Why put that time in again. Lvl 5 maybe/understandable. But you\'ve made me not want to play this game anymore and it\'s sad because I enjoyed it',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out' ],

       'Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they\'re back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',

Not that it happens often, but when you\'ve spent 50 diamonds for a one hour key and you lose 3 to 4 minutes  getting back in the game it sucks. How can your game allow this to happen !!! At least design a way to return the time lost to the player. Thank you.',

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',

The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',

       'Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there\'s an ad, some you can\'t skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don\'t even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed',
       'All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I\'m pretty sure that if some one who is religious see\'s that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.',
       'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don\'t take it away from me. It is beautiful.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.' ],

     [ 'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Awesome It\'s a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.' ],

     [ 'Amazing game if you like naval warships. UPDATE: As of Feb 17 2018, the new update has seriously increased the game content and fun level. UPDATE as of Feb 27 2018, Lowered my rating to 4 stars because there is a constant issue with the timers or something like that.  I login and collect the crate and start a module upgrading then login several hours late and is like no time elapsed in the game from the last time I logged in. This has happened several times in the past as well.',
       'Definitely a good game and worth your time and money. Only issue that developers really need to attend to is how they select the team. You can\'t have 7 ships of high ranks against 5 or 4 ships of low rank. It makes a person want to delete the game even after spending money on it. Keep same ranked players together in a battle. Really irritating.',
       'Fact need a good connection to keep control of your ships Now, I have plenty of $$$ nothing to spend on it. Waiting to get the last max destroyer ship i can get on the random container spin.  Also noted... I open up the app the next day and the container count down says 2+ hours. It should read 0 zero I would think.',
       'This is a fantastic game one of the best by miles. I am not sure however, that the latest update was such a success. Prior to update the smaller torpedo boats had a good chance now that dynamic has been removed by the dominance of the larger ships firepower and slow reload times on torpedoes.  This means that the strategic component has been somewhat diminished',
       'Best battleship game on Android hands down ! Better than wargaming ship game great controls great graphics !Fun to play good selection of warships and large maps and they keep on doing updates to keep it interesting! And the most important thing is the price of ships are fair keep up the great work . I love the last update with graphics and maps and ships. the only thing the Bismarck is under powered can you make her stronger because she was the pride of Germany and everybody complains she is not a good ship.She is a powerhouse thank you!',
       'look since the update the game constantly resarts when trying to enter battle.....  now I just had my tablet lock up for a half hour....  the chat in this game has killed it.... constantly getting the game  restarted..... booting back to desktop. I have been playing for over a year with iowa and new Jersey completely maxed...  its sad to see the quality go down' ],

     [ 'Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to "rent" which is an option in the game.',
       'Good game. Needs a seeding system. Getting bored of being killed by players 10-15 levels above me. Spawn points need looking at too. Keeps respawning at the same point I just died at. There appears to be some hacked players too. Just shot 1 guy 7 times in the head and he took it and shot me back once which was enough to kill me',
       'Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and "WIN" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.',
       'This game would get ten stars if devs can fix the spazzout camera episode that happens at least once per minute. Suddenly I\'m aiming at sky spinning for 1-3 secs and usually I die or miss a kill as a result.. please please fix this. Otherwise best mobile shooter game available' ],

     [ 'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco\'s in my silo then tell me they can\'t refund it because I\'m a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it\'s actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn\'t a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it\'s great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.',
       'It is an amazing game. Our entire family is hooked and i love the idea of neighbourhood chat on hay day it is awesome!!! Continue making this game as cool as it is👍. However it would be nice to have private chat on hayday where the entire neighbourhood does not see your conversation. There is also a glitch where i cannot open my daily videos.' ],

     [ 'So I\'ve won around 100 battles so far. Enjoying the game. Ready to see where this game is taken. I feel updates could make this unto the best mobile music game on the playstore. It\'s nice to always be able to recharge your stamina through ads. I hope updates come and also limited decals. One drawback and a fix needed is losing the stuff you paid for when you change the item.',
       'Would be better if you were placed in matched based not only on your discs but also on the levels of your band. I shouldn\'t get a perfect score and STILL lose because their passive is higher than mine but they made more mistakes. Also maybe up the sensitivity? it seems like the system doesn\'t quite pick up on my tapping  which causes me to miss notes. Graphics are nice and the spin offs are good.',
       'This game is pretty addicting the songs are short & sweet, the songs are not original songs but have a similar sound to the original ones, and are named differently too. The only thing that kinda sucks are the ads which you have to pay to remove & that the band runs on stamina. So if your band runs out of stamina you have to wait several minutes before you could play again but other than that I really like it and it has that guitar hero feeling to it ..',
       'What happens when you miss a note??? NOTHING. the song keeps playing perfectly so what then is the point of playing the game correctly if there is no penalty on the song quality? No point besides screen shaking smh. Make it like the console version where you hear a bad note.',
       'I can never watch a video for more stamina and everytime I try to collect the 2x reward money by watching the video the game just glitches out on me. I would have so much more without the flaw. I want to make in-app purchases but this deters me for sure. UPDATE!',
       'Game is really fun. The ads for other game aren\'t cool if you let your kids play the game. Especially it having an E rating. That is unacceptable. I understand ads is why it\'s free  but don\'t have 14+ rated game ads for an E game. Glad I didn\'t let my kids play this yet' ],

Buildings should not require high numbers of colours that have had little or no play or a player should be able to move from previous cities what every they want not limited to 1000.  All in all I enjoy the game but it could be s bit friendlier.  Thank you',
       'Love this little game! I wish we had five life\'s, Three just gets me started. But overall, it\'s a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don\'t make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!',
       'I love this game. It is the only one I have on my phone anymore. There are a few new issues though. When the scratch tickets come through, I can\'t send to friends. It freezes and the only way for me to get out of it is to close the app. I think we should be able to cash in the travel vouchers, in not for coins then at least boosts. I think I\'m on day 93 of the treasure chests, and like the fact that I don\'t have to pay for the chests anymore. What I don\'t like are the rewards from the chest. If for reaching the milestone on days checked in, like day 90 I am given less resources than the level I just played, I might as well just play the level and not bother with the chest. I do love the interesting facts given about the destinations though. I do think it would be beneficial to have a button where we can contact you within the game instead of having to post on the review platform.',

I went to play the game & all of a sudden my game cleared & it  took me back to the first play on Sydney.I have no Sydney no Tokyo.I am pissed about this. I really enjoyed this game but, if this is the way  you operate then I am over this game for sure.....',
       'I like playing it very much. What I miss is the possibility of getting more of the real interesting facts  about cities I\'m in. In other words -I would like it to be more educational together with the fun of playing. I like as well that I can play it offline and then it is synced afterwords. I have non FB friends who play it and would like to  connect through this app- but it\'s not possible, is it? .Thanks',
       'Not enough lives....3 is mean. Don\'t know what the gems  that you win, or the student hats do. I haven\'t even cleared Sydney and levels are too hard to clear.

This game is literally the best ever. 01.03.18 Although in the new update I went to type something on leagues and the game just crashed, it also made my phone spam so I had to shut it down and reload my phone up, please investigate this.',

Please help me and fix this, my app is up to date, and i even re unstall it a few times desperately trying ro get adds back! But it was no good 😔😔',

Your rewards are pretty crappy too. The "chances" when we\'re opening packs are not chances, it\'s "open as many as you want until you have no money left and still haven\'t gotten anything". If you\'re reading this (which you probably won\'t give a fuck about because you get this everyday), you better make some changes. If you\'re just hell-bent on making money, then you should go fuck yourself.',

Another weird thing is that this game disconnects soooo easily... I was playing it then I got disconnected and couldn\'t join back in. I then tried playing my other games and my Wifi was just fine. EA why did you update this game the fucking shooting is so messed up... You\'ve fucked it up so bad',

After calming down I realized that this is one of the best if not the best casino game out the right now. You don\'t have locked slot machines initially and the variety it\'s pretty cool with bingo blackjack slots etc etc I only keep Two casino games on my phone and this is one of them. I needed to redo my review because at the end of the day it is a great app, it can be challenging however it is a lot of fun 👍👍✌',

       'Absolute rubbish DO NOT BOTHER WITH IT. AND DON\'T PLAY THE FRUIT SHOWN AS GUESTS BECAUSE THEY JUST TAKE YOUR COINS, THEY ARE PART OF THE GAME. And when you start winning it loses connection when none of my other games do, i play on my other laptop to test ut and that worked fine playing other games so how come gin rummy always cut off. Then you get some that play 1 game then shove off. And when you start having a winning run it decides to cut you off by making out connection is lost, WHEN I HAVE PERFECT WIFI CONNECTION,  dont like you winning too often.   Verse 2: When you keep winning you get disconnected, strange when nothing else doesnt disconnect at home, THEY DONT LIKE YOU WINNING TOO OFTEN. Also dont play players with no picture as you wont win, they always get straight fixed hands to beat you. Its strange how some players keep getting strajght hands time after time after time, it does all it can to stop you winning, DONT PAY ANYTHING INTO THIS GAME. Then you get the idiots who play 1 game then shoot off soon as they lose, LOSERS. Just won a straight hand and didn\'t pay out the jackpot saying there was nk winner, another fricking catch to stop you getting the jackpot. And it must be a fix how come some players keep getting straight hands time and time straight after each other. And some players just grab and run. This game gets more and more fixed every day, the makers of it are making it harder by putting more fake players in it, do what you lije but i aint lining your pockets. BEWARE THE GAME WANTS YOU TO PAY. Just played anothet rigged player, straight hands, start noting these players and postkng em so you all know who not to play. Yet another bot taking away coins, fixed for certain to win. Strange how i just added to my review the 1st game i played it froze and wouldnt let me pick a card, strange that, another fix. Just played another bot guys, tested it, every card i threw the bot took everytime and had straight hands.',

It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',

You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released.

When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',

     [ 'I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.',
       'Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating \'the option\' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.',
       'I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the \'hints\' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven\'t discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it\'s not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.',
       'It\'s a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don\'t find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.',
       'I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It\'s educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it\'s just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁',
       'Other reviews are accurate  for me.. hints become irritating in that they only flash on for a second and you miss them rather than find them useful.  They also appear too soon so you have little time to search.  I also found the occasional issue registering a word and having to go over it several times. But it\'s a free game, it\'s fun, it\'s addictive what else is there to say ? It\'s good.' ],

And I have a few badly needed suggestions. First of all, and most of all, a SAVE REPLAY feature and a SCREENSHOT feature. Adding both of these things would improve the game TREMENDOUSLY. Second of all, GRAPHICS OPTIMIZATION. It can get pretty lagged up on some of my favorite levels. And it\'s the same for other people. And last of all, a VR feature. Like for first person camera, there could be VR compatibility. This is not badly needed, but it would be pretty awesome. So, Secret Exit crew, please please PLEASE read this review, and please consider it. These ideas will make the game better.',

Otherwise it\'s a fun game, but you won\'t get past the ads for too long without uninstalling likely.',

       'Thank you for creating a game that is actually fun!!  The payouts are excellent!  This is the best slot game that I have played and I have been through quite a few!  The only thing that could make this game even better is to make clubs so we can talk to team mates!  Please do not change the win/loose ratio like all other slots have done.  I have recommended your game to everyone I know with positive comments from all!',

Do you need me to write a second review? I stand by my original comment. Please don\'t ask me to write a third review, it takes me away from the game!',

Please fix this or tell me what I am doing wrong. I won\'t  quit the game but it is disheartening not to earn my bonus! Ty' ],

     [ 'You\'re just plain fun! You really understand the right amount of challenge to keep it fun but not aggravating. Have to admit I did use some hints. May I make a teeny weeny suggestion. Make a link at end to "rate the game," I wanted to, looked around, in end clicked link to play red then find yellow to do this rating... that\'s cuz I like yah... thanks for the smile!',
       'This is as simple as it can be, yet perfect in every way. Relaxing music that doesn\'t distract you from your game, smooth gameplay, easy controls. I liked the fact that you are tossed into the game without any tutorials, left on your own. I am not really into puzzle games but I completed this game in a single afternoon and it had me asking for more.',
       'Just finished this one less than 5 minutes ago, I\'d definitely have to say I enjoyed red more. yellow had some more difficult puzzles. Some of them were (kinda?) reused in red. I overall enjoyed it a lot!   I\'m really looking forward to the next one!',
       'It\'s so captivating I finished it in a single morning! I love how challenging the puzzles are at the same time they are fun. The level 49 made me go crazy because I couldn\'t get it right, I had to draw the squares  so I wouldn\'t press the wrong one. I totally loved it and I\'m so going to download red!',
       'I love Bonte  games. As always, beautiful graphics and just the right level of difficulty. Looking forward to the next one. Thanks Bart. I just have to edit this to add that I don\'t understand why people are complaining about ads. You only need to watch them for a hint, and only briefly. It\'s a free game, and the developer has to make a living. You can pay to get them removed, but they really aren\'t obtrusive at all.',
       'To be honest, I was like this is going to be boring 💤, but within minutes, I was totally hooked. Absolutely amazing, love it. If fact, I went straight back online and got red. I\'ve not heard of this Bart Bonte before, but he\'s a bit magic.' ],

     [ 'This game has a chip sale and it never pays out. It constantlyI takes it all back. I have been playing DoubleDown Casino for over a year now. I have enjoyed the game tremendously. However I noticed that I purchased chips all the time. The game takes all the chips each time and you have to repurchase. I have a Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge Plus. I have tried to install DoubleDown Casino many times and it always crashes. So for now I will not install it on my phone. I am still playing,its addicting..but i am still looking for other games to fill my time.',
       'Graphics are totally messed up at start up.  I cannot see games. The games that appear are games I do not play. I have deleted and readded casino but games are still not showing. Wheel spins give low points. Hard to get high points. When you manage to get a good score, it takes away until you get low. I like the games but often lose down to nothing. I will not buy credit for any games I play so if losing  credit is an attempt to get me to buy, forget it. I have kept this casino open longer than any others because I actually like the games.',
       'Can\'t excess secret of the forest game for four days it will give me my daily amount but won\'t let me play it my amount is 650500 please fix this game so that i can access it.   Can\'t access these games in the last three days what going on this game system It\'s back down again and can\'t access any games. Still having problems access my games i enjoy playing please repair and fix it thank you',

     [ 'Love this game!  Needs a little refining of the interface to help manage dwellers more easily. Gear inventory listing by attribute would be nice and should also show equipped items to facilitate swapping. Access to character window from each facility window would help with gear and dweller assignment. Load times are long and cause occasional crashes. All of these issues are palatable because the game it\'s so strong.  Still playing as is because it\'s nicely balanced, thank you!',
       'This is a pretty good app,  but when building it needs an option to replace a room with another type. You shouldn\'t have to spend all your caps to rework a floor plan, especially when you built everything not knowing you could combine rooms since the help pop ups didn\'t mention that until after you had been building a while.  Other than that it is thoroughly acceptable.',
       'I love this game, it\'s really fun. The only thing I wished was that when the characters level up, it actually does something more than raise their health. Like, increase stats in the place their working, or increase production. Maybe not every level, but there should be more benefits to leveling up. When bringing wastelanders back, let\'s say they are gone for an hour and you start to bring them back, when you get to ten minutes before they get home and put them back to exploration, they shouldn\'t jump back to where they started, from an hour. Idk. But I love the game.',
       'This game is so very exciting to play. As an avid fan of nearly all Bethesda games, this is a great mobile representation of their Fallout Universe. The gameplay is enticing and there is always something new around every quest; however it should be noted every quest storyline has variance, the quest gameplay is similiar between all. Comparing your dwellers from the beginning to a week into the game and there is a sense of accomplishment. The customisation of the dwellers and vault rooms is satisfying. The only thing I would add that isn\'t already presented, would be multiplayer. A way to send dwellers or explore eachothers vaults. If this option exists, and I just don\'t see it, I apologize.  Great game. Love to play.',
       'I really enjoy Fallout Shelter. As a huge Fallout fan, I had to try it when it first came out. Stopped playing for a while when I had built a huge vault, but now with the quests there is a wonderful long time motivation to it. I especially like the quiz quests where you have to prove your knowledge of the main series games, the legendary dwellers from the main games are also a very nice touch.',

     [ 'Fun game to play. I don\'t like new high stakes betting. You never win and lose your coins really fast. Don\'t waste your real money to buy coins because they won\'t last either. Glad they raised free coins you but now machines don\'t pay out as often. Have fun with your free coins and this is a good time.',
       'No point in the game you win coins fast loose the even faster! You might win 100000 or 10000000 but as soon as you do it takes It away. Wouldn\'t dare spend any real money on this game! Fun for 5 mins each day nothing else',
       'Started playing two years ago and loved it. Does not start out with a ridiculous amount of credits, you have to work to achieve them, part of t he fun. Lost my original game and could not get it back. Love it so much just had to download it again.',
       'I use to love! this game, it was the one game that did not cheat you out of your coins now the game is red it doesn\'t stop when you wanted to stop some lines stick together in the game or if you push the game to stop it continues to roll that\'s cheating that\'s literally cheating people out of their money now the game sucks I would never buy coins to play this game again. I will only play with the coins this game allow me thank you',
       'I just began playing Pharaoh\'s way tonight, I love everything about it except the two times it tried to show me some special things that are going on in the game, it freezes up and won\'t let me play until I completely shut it down and reboot the app. I hope you can resolve this problem! If you can, it\'ll be a next to perfect gaming app!',

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'A very addictive game that\'s great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it\'s 5 stars all the way!',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls' ],

A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',

     [ 'March 1st, 2018 @ 7pm eastern time. The game loads, and as soon as I touch ANYTHING it crashes the game, so I reload the game, and again, I touch anything, and the game crashes. A few days ago this started, actually, as soon as I was FORCED to update the game is when it started. A little note for the developers, if the game doesn\'t work, people won\'t play and you won\'t make money off the ads, it\'s really that simple. You really need to make the game stable before you bring in new content. I haven\'t played a match in at least a week due to the game crashing. So, ultimatum time I guess, I\'ll give you a couple days to respond or release another update or I\'m just going to delete the game and never come back to it, even if it becomes a viral game (which it won\'t if it doesn\'t work for more than 3.5 seconds). Maybe talk to other developers and find out why it\'s so unstable. Just a suggestion.',

Sat and played it for hours straight to try and build up the bank. Made it to level 23 and the game just stopped paying. I know you want us to make purchases but how is anyone going to want to purchase if it just depletes your winnings that fast. I\'m done!!',
       'Beautiful graphics,  smooth layout and really tough to move on to next challenges. Game doesn\'t payout as huge as it seems.  Overall fun to play and challenging for a slot game. Want a game to kill time, literally,  this it. Enjoy and good luck! Update..OK so I spent 5 diamonds to try and get extra spins which I did and won 30 free spins, I was betting 250k and won a whopping 1.5 mill out of 30 spins. Really? Come on! I understand greed but 30 spins and won what was equivalent to 7 free spins. Sheesh this is suppose to be fun right? Played the latest table for almost an hour on all bets and NOT 1 bonus game. GL all you will need it. Make sure bring your lucky rabbits foot.',

     [ 'REMOVE TANKS AND ARMOURED SUVS   The game is amazing. All the guns are balanced but there is one big problem... It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. 😂',
       'Problem I have is that it promotes multiplayer use, but you cannot tell who is an actual player or an AI, there is no chat system like it says, and half of anything it talks about is unavailable in the game. The concept itself is great, the game itself is a great time waster, but I have to call it out on its false advertisement.   Now, if I may have been mistaken, someone please correct me, but so far as I can see there is nothing in the game that suggests multiplayer capabilities.',
       'This game is actually mentally retarded. The only good thing I can say is that at least it runs at 60fps. The controls are not always there, for example, in the waiting match, I cannot jump, because the button disappeared. When I was trying to play this with a friend as a joke, I was genuinely confused as to what was going on, and I have played both Fortnite, and PUBG',
       'This game is so fun! I didn\'t expect it to be so good. I imagined that this would be like any other game remake, you know, a lot of glitches, bad graphics, and very high sensitivity. But, to my surprise, it was not like that at all. It was better than expected. I\'m going to be playing this game for a long time. I\'ll tell you that much!   This game is an instant🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟!!! - Andrew from Roboticfalcon21 Reviews',
       'Way to many ads. Ad to get to homescreen ad to get to waiting area, ad to get to arena. On top of that kept jumping back to homescreen and loading another ad instead of going to waiting area. Uninstalled, a shame because it seemed quite good.',
       'I think it is very similar to battle ground and has that pixle theme going on. But I would love this game even more if you guys could make a chat where we could talk to other players' ],

     [ 'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'One of the few games that I don\'t mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card\'s artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',

       'Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer.',
       'Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I\'m watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability.

     [ 'It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could "ditch the glitch" so to speak. Thanks',
       'So hard to beat the game. I\'m not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can\'t buy anything in shop without real money.',
       'Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win',
       'I raced 500\'s out in some of the real known Desert race\'s until I went off the freeway trying to come home from the Mojave 250 and was in the hospital for a year. Fell asleep behind the wheel, I should of died but I  made it. . . . . .',
       'First too hard the first beginning devils should be easy not hard 2 make the bikes easier to unlock less quests 3 I have bike #5 and on the 5 level the rider can keep up with me pretty well I have 4 more devils of bike more than him he shouldn\'t be able to keep up overall poor  difficulty divisions to hard butt if you could fix that and many have so you can by any bike without having to go through the devils it b 5 stars plz plz plz fix it\'s looms great and is great just needs those fixes to b the best',
       'This game is one of those that get you coming back. The learning curve is steep, yet not so steep for it to be frustrating. As you become beter you can actually feel yourself doing beter and going faster. This game is the perfect mix between difficult and entertaining. The only reason for the 4/5 is because of the grinding required to get beter bikes at a later stage. Yet it feels more like working towards something rather than grinding endlessly, thanks to the mini rewards along the way. All in all a very fun game' ],

The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do.

The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear.

Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets.

The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.Eternium is crafted with passion by a small band of old-school RPG fans, who love making the game they always wanted to play.',

     [ 'Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It\'s entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I\'ve been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It\'s a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they\'ve made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.',
       'The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell',
       'Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I\'m playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!',
       'The game is addictive. I was hoping to play it offline all the time but you need and internet connection to upgrade skills and craft its annoying because I don\'t have wifi and I use mobile data. Still it gives me the feels of Diablo all over again.',
       'Nice game, but with little variety. The graphics are nice, the authors have a very honest approach to the game, making it more of a donation game than a greedy one. If you want to play without paying you can do it but you will spend a lot of time watching videos. Honest again, but it makes the levels a bit to long when you see all videos and ruins the game pace. In fact this is a 4 star game, even with the two negative points, but I give it 3 to lower the overall rating which I think it\'s a bit to high...',
       'The game itself is quite good. Control is so-so. I wish they had a control pad. But 3/5 the gems system force you to watch 5-6 videos in a 10 min run. If you don\'t you can\'t unlock team or spells etc. It remove the fun of the game after some hours. Can\'t recommend. Btw most ppl rate it 5 stars to get 50 gems. You see the pattern' ],

     [ 'It was a good game, until new update. The car body now go to scrap and not in the selling list, thus reduced the profit earning. Also in buildings needs to be repaired, materiap required is of huge quantity. Graphics needs to be better. Game play is easier to understand. Also in bank no complete cash statement is available, like complete diamond spend statement is available and not cash one.  Will surely give 5 star after fixing above points',
       'You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.',
       'Great time killer... Love it so far and only been playing since yesterday... Already level 11 and got quite a few things however I gave 4 stars because I spent 10 diamonds on the bank which showed the stock market but didn\'t tell me it was coming soon until I paid for it... I like that this game doesn\'t make you pay real cash and gives you tokens just to win more cash, diamonds, energy etc so please don\'t ruin the game in the future and make us pay 2 play =)',
       'The game is over good. It\'s definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can\'t obtain "glass" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can\'t move up, it\'s pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don\'t want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it\'s a good game and I would recommend it',
       'It\'s a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don\'t know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.',
       'Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly' ],

     [ 'This is one of the best flip games I have played in a long time. Love the way they have implemented the physics in the game. It is like flipping the real thing. Every knife has it\'s own style of flipping. The collection is also amazing. Best part you don\'t need to buy gold for knifes. You can earn it. Some of the blades are paid but won\'t mind buying them as it is worth. Amazing job people 👍',
       'Hi! The game is amazing. Simple, yet very addictive. The color scheme is amazing, and the sounds are great. But I do have one little complaint ; Sometimes the "Card" knife doesn\'t stick into the log when it lands on the tip, although it should clearly stick and count as a point. Have a wonderful rest of your day :)',
       'REALLY FUN AND INTERESTING. i like how there is a very large variety of knives available to get. A few problems : i am not willing 2 pay money for a knife in a game, it glitches and lets me watch infinite vids 4 infinite money, some of the knives are really stupid',
       'This is a great time-passer (if you finally have some spare time) , good graphics, and mostly good physics.    However, I recently discovered that players are punished via a lock timer for marathoning advertisements to unlock knives... Why?',
       'A fun and addictive game but there are some issues with the game\'s economy. It\'s all about collecting the different knives but to do that you need a large amount of money which is earned the fastest with the expensive knives (Or just watching ads). The knife you may enjoy the most may only be 1 coin per flip so you feel forced to use another one worth 2 or 3 that you don\'t enjoy as much. I would like to see a system implemented that lets you upgrade a knife to be worth more so you have an incentive to try and use new knives that aren\'t initially worth 3 coins per flip but can be upgraded to be worth 3.',
       'So simple yet so fun!! You can watch ads to earn knives which I love since I\'m not a paying player. Alot of apps limit non payers but not this one. Definitely download it if you\'re thinking about it. Super addicting!' ],

       'I like the game but please get rid of using blueprints to research ship upgrades! I mean what\'s wrong with xp? Getting blueprints you need is completely random and as far as I know not effected by your performance.',
       'Great fun with a good variety of ships. Being a fairly new game it has it\'s occasional glitches but once those are sorted and more ships for different countries are added, I\'ll be hooked.',
       'Good game but match making still needs work and the amount of silver u earn per game towards upgrades and equipment is really bad even with permium ships the economy is very bad' ],
