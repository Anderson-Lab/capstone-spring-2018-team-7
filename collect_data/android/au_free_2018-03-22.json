Thanks for the fantastic game but please fix the 'free coins on us' broken links.",

        "Was doing great until day 3. Then NO bonus and a big dive to no funds. If u want to play fun games for a few days, then uninstall...this is ur best choice."

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries, and is a national hobby in Russia.Features:- five different themes- seven levels of difficulty- two players mode- game assistant (Helper)- realistic graphics- sound effects- small size",

        "Make that we can upgrade weapon to become stronger. Add reward when you have 100% in one Chapter. Make skin for weapon. Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game. Literaly all have similar characteristic +1 and +5 etc. And what is the point to collect other characters? For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different. You can reword weapon for rank, rank 5 win something, rank 10, 15, 20...",

        "Graphic is surprisingly great when I run it on my Galaxy S9+. A lot of actions. Not as stretgey as the game sniper, but more action and movements than sniper if you ever play it. Worth to try. Barry",
        "The only issue I have with this game is rex's head. Please make it transparent so we can actually see through it. Otherwise I can't see anything because his head is in the way.",
        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers",
        "This game is a lot of fun, really addictive and completely free to play. Of course you can buy stuff if you want, but it's not necessary.   Multiple game modes, a ton of upgrades.   This is a good one."

Then I noticed that they changed the looks and now it looks horrible and stupid I was disappointed by this plus to many damn ads! PS unupdate the app the older version was better the new one sucks!!",

I bet that u make money every time some1 sees an ad on in your game, but u won't make any money if that person stops playing the game because of how much ads. I have been playing this game for 10 minutes and already come across around 100 ads. I might take away some of that cash income because the amount of ads Is insane. Would u rather make No Money, or A decent bit of money?",
        "The game could be better if you tone down the ads a bit more... Maybe 10 games one ad? Or maybe more? Its really annoying when you get ads every end of the round.",

I am enjoying this relaxing, mind game however, I had to reset my phone and all my progress was lost...not cool! I've contacted the developers / company twice with no fix offered yet.😔😕 Hoping to get an accommodation and a way to avoid this issue in the future!",
        "This is a pretty awesome app which makes our mind to formulate words with the given letters. But many a times we come across words for which we are unaware of the meaning. If you guys can create a small block on the screen which displays the meaning of the last word created/accepted. Then this app will become an ultimate learning app or say vocabulary building app as well. Hoping to see the enhancement is sometime near future.",

So never buy a new phone if you don't want to start over.",
        "I really enjoy playing. Addictive even my husband downloaded!  My only frustration is that myself an him paid for no ads however he seems to get perks such as extra random coins an i dont! Why?? The game is good but doesnt feel consistent for all.",
        "The advertisement I saw for this game, WASNT EVEN THIS GAME. I downloaded it expecting a different time of word game, looked like a whole bunch of Scrabble word tiles lined up and you'd choose words. This game is nothing like that. Its ok, but very misleading advertisement and disappointed in that.",
        "It's fun and cute. I like that it gets harder as you progress. Edit: March 17th, 2018. There was an ad after you completed a level and that was fine. That's how it was last night and usually the ads were quick. Now there is an add at the very bottom of your game which really makes it difficult to concentrate and you accidentally click it every time you shuffle your letters. This was 5 stars, but now it's going to have to be 3. That, to me, is very annoying and eventually I'll stop playing altogether as a result."

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",

Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

        "This is a fantastic game. Free to play is completely viable and you actually have a chance to compete with those who pay. Has a few bugs here and there like hulk getting frozen or Hawkeye freezing the game but the devs are actively working on it. Worth the download, no question.",
        "Wasnt compatible with my tablet at first. Now it is. Thats awesome. Only problem is i got to a high level on my phone but i can't sign into google on my phone. But i can sign into google on my tablet. So cant access my progress from my phone on my tablet. Dont want to do it all over again and dont want to keep the app on my phone. So just gonna delete if it doesn't get fixed.",
        "Other than the glitches in the arena (ie; hulk freezing intermittently which freezes the match I'm in), I'm really enjoying this game! I would like to see players being able to get higher than level 50, but I'm sure that's coming.",
        "Game is looking really good so far the toon animations are awesome and the devs seem to be working hard to fix the bugs. There is a couple of problem in the guilds atm that really needs fixxed anyone can start the raids this results is people wasting points when the info says only officers and leaders can start raids (as it should be) also there is alot off guys guild hopping and farming guild raids with tag ons there needs to be a cooldown period added!!"

        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

        "I. Freaking. LOVE this game! I used to love playing it as a child so when I saw it here I decided to give it a chance, and it's so legit! It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone"

        "Had friends refer me to the  games. At 1st I wasn't  happy I couldn't  just  select  the games I wanted to play I had to earn the level it was on to open them. It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm",
        "Have so much fun playing this. It's nice to be able to have a \"flutter\" and not use real money. Good fun, great graphics and so many different slots to choose from, plus the rewards are well worth it. Thank you hof! Awesome!! Love this game! Though only one thing to gripe about, the adds are becoming more invasive. Despite this I thoroughly enjoy myself! So keep it up!",
        "Hardly play anymore. The higher the level the bigger the minimum bet becomes and there goes your coins. Bonuses the are low.The only good payouts happen after you purchase coins. I haven't gotten rid of it because it is something to do while waiting for other games to be ready.  Update.... It has gotten somewhat better, however the payouts are still low even with a larger bet"

        "Something has happened.. I am currently playing the attack master event. I have attacked 20 times at least. But the metre only indicates 6 attacks. Everytime I attack I see hammers going to the metre but the number there remains the same. I would have gotten 12 million and evemln more but due to this issue I haven't. It's definitely the fault of game. Please fix it as soon as possible.",
        "Very frustrating to have to work for weeks to earn enough to build in the higher levels and have it constantly being destroyed because in three days worth of spins you only receive 2 shields... not to mention the rarity of free spins (maybe once a week) Game is an exercise in frustration and not worth the download.",
        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "Way way WAYYY too laggy. It's an easy casual game though. I wouldn't say it's \"fun\" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That's it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there's no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.",
        "It clicks on adds with out me hitting it at all. Then when I get back to the app it forgets that I watched the add at all even tho I watched all the way through. It happens repeatedly. It only forgets half the time but it almost always clicks on the adds. Other than that it's a good time killer with easy ways to get through it quickly as long as you watch some adds."

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars.",

Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",

        "I love the series more and more with every installment. Great game, with simple aesthetics and a fun way to coklect gear and powers. The animations are rag-dolly sometimes but other than that it's perfect. I have one suggestion for Nekki. Why aren't you guys making games for consoles? You're too advanced for mobile. You could be the future mortal kombat sensation.",
        "Game is cool, very smooth and fluid. Graphics also are great. Loved playing this game but got a fatal error after which game restarts. After restarting, all player data is wiped out. After 3 seconds message says that data found restart necessary, then again the same loop goes on.  Tried clearing cache and data also.. but no use..Had to re-install the game.",
        "Graphics are awesome, it controls and plays very well. Fights are slick and intense with wonderful animation that makes great use of slow-mo to highlight big moves and finishing hits. The only real barrier to me giving this a full hearted recommendation is that there are microtransactions ALL OVER THE PLACE. If you don't like those distracting you constantly, not the game for you.",
        "Loved the new BGM... ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Just one thing, please make the animation speed a little bit more fast. It's slightly annoying to wait that long for a window to open to show the equipments or switch between armour and equipments. Please note that.  But overall...it's the best game I've ever played. Kudos",
        "Simply World's best game. This is the best game I Have played. Good graphics and amazing gameplay. But it's mission are pretty hard.I have a request can you please make a second name change because when I first started playing in excitement to play this game I had chosen a bad name and I wanted to change it. And I think like me many players had done this so please think about this.",
        "Great game so far, NEKKI! But you guys do really need to fix the balancing issue and release Chapter 4. Also am I the only one who managed to defeat all bosses on insane and impossible difficulties (but I only defeated Deng Rao on hard difficulty)?"

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "I've been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment ''Wow, update, ok''. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they've done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can't just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg."

Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",
        "Great time killer! On those nights I can't sleep, which is too often, this is the best app to turn my would be long night into an extremely short night. The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "This app is great for passing time, I also love how you can play offline. Its very addicting as well. The only downside is that there are way to many advertisements, I can't even play one song without there being an ad",
        "I mean the game is great! But all of these add-on power up stuff always being added ends up ruining the classic game for me. I love the good original design, no power-ups or anything too extra. I don't use them and find them annoying. It's a great time killer, and a real challenege.  But, as said before, the game is going too extra and I don't really like it.  Playing it is fun, the add-ons are not."

X also when u customize your character i would like there to be makeup and able to choose your clothes! The options are amazinggg! ❤❤ i hate having to use wifi as well xx love the game loads! Your amazing! ❤❤ please please please add these things i like xx ❤❤😉😁",
        "I love this game and I have been playing for years. Now I've decided to create stories as well but I'm not a laptop person for I prefer using my phone. I would appreciate it if there was more background options like allowing me to upload my own background and more emotion options in the mobile version of create a story. Please make that happen and keep up the good work!",
        "My only complaint would be the gem choices. Although the app allows you to earn gems by reading episode official stories, most choices cost 15-20 gems. You would have to read an entire story (sometimes more) to gain the ability to get ONE gem option, and most stories have multiple gem instances. Other than that, the game is addicting. I would enjoy it much more of the gem costs were more reasonable (5 gems), or if you could earn gems by reading user stories too."

Whenever I try to watch an ad, the game crashes and the random pop up ads have like a 20% chance to crash the game.",
        "The game overall is awesome, though there are some things that need some work.   To give an example I personally find it very annoying when the screen zooms in when you get a combo. Like it is now it's very hard to manouvre around incoming cops as you only have a split second to react. Maybe something like a copcar indicator would be in place as well.  For the rest I find the game great and super fun to play, although I'd hope to see newer, cooler and more expensive cars. The ones that are available right now are quite easy to get and don't need much grinding at all.  All with all it's a great game and I love playing it. Keep on the good work folks!",

        "Before the update, you were able to put your Tamagotchi to sleep and then exit the app. With the latest update, you can't do that. I liked the opportunity of exiting out the app while my Tamagotchi is sleeping so that I don't have to wait awhile for his energy to refill. I've exited out of the app three times after putting him to sleep and three times, I had to return to put him to bed again. PLEASE fix this because I liked it before the new update.",
        "I paid for the starter pack which says it will remove the mandatory ads but guess what, ads are still there. Please do something about it and I will change my ratings.  Edit after reply* wow not even an apology for someone who paid. Kind sir, then please at least let your consumers know that there are actually 2 kind of ads instead of just simply stating 1? No Tom dick or harry will know that unless you state it. Good day.",
        "The only issue i had is the back button when tamagochi sleep. It make auto-wake state when i push the back button. It would be nice if even i push the back button tamagochi still sleeping instead wake up and also option for how long they sleep like 4,6,8 hours. I'll change the rating after the back button issue has fix. Btw the game is good, you should add adventure or something like that.",
        "Good nostalgia, awesome graphics but needs better execution. Allow optional interactivity with friends, for example. The main point of using a smartphone is connectivity. Make earning anything easier, this will increase the replay value. Your game will become popular by word of mouth, I tell you. Don't make it a quick cash grab. Think about how you can keep the game afloat instead of having to scrap it and start anew if it fails.",
        "I did a YouTube video over this app. Overall Tamagotchi Forever is fun. But ads and lack of things to do made this app a miss opportunity for the creators. I do like optional ads. But the ads at the top and in between screens are lame. Also for an app like this cosmetics are the perfect thing to add, but they limit the costumes to about 3 each character. Another nice thing that would've been cool to see would've been decorating your house & visiting friends. These other things would've made the app great.",
        "I can't see ur advise is helping me, none of them. Back button will appear after i press phone's back button. And it makes my pet wakes from his sleep.  And yes, we can collect all of the character but we can't interract with other player, we ONLY can collect and evolve them, not like in tamagotchi v7 if u know what i mean.  Unistalling this game"

If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",

        "for anybody just starting out don't bother to download and play this game. I've been playing pretty much from the first version and have yet to find a fuel tank for my motorcycle. the developers either just don't listen to the people playing the game and address the problems people have with the game or don't care. with every update it's becoming more and more obvious they're more concerned with how to get more money out of players that are willing to spend it.",
        "Dog update just lost all my data including motorcycle, nearly finished acid bath, and atv, cement base with maxed out trunks, loads of stuff. Played every day for months to have it all wiped away in 1 update. They have done this repeatedly to others and yes it was connected to playstore. I have restored it before. This time it doesnt connect!"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "The game is very fun and progression is steady as you get better, on the downside once you get through your first play through with the app and come back later there are 30 second adds that pop up after every other round or so. A little disappointing but no biggie the game is really quite fun.",
        "I feel like I would really like this game but it is not working on the Android phone. So I have never actually played the game but I have tried to open it up like 50 times.  Every time I tried to open it, it would just lag out right when it was going to show me the home screen.  If this gets fixed then I will play this game and most likely enjoy the game but for now it is awful.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them."

        "More ads= more money, less stars= less money so you choose. Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Great game, I totally love it. I don't mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

It's so awesome and I absolutely love how everything is pixelated and that makes it more charming. Not to mention that the music is fantastic as well and I never get tired of listening to it!",
        "Love this game because you don't have to spend real money, just tap the screen to get coins and also diamonds then upgrade the guns, rinse and repeat but it never gets boring. Only trouble I've had is a sore tapping finger. LOL",
        "This would be a fine time-waster if they reign in the ads, until that happens, about like the plague.  They started out as a means to (optional) easy buffs. Fine, annoying, but not that bad. Suddenly, random ads are popping up in the middle of the game and you get nothing out of it. Totally unacceptable way to run a game. Don't bother, there are thousands of other time wasting idle/incremental games that show an ounce of respect for their customers. These guys simply don't.",
        "this game is basically an app for watching ads. you are forced to watch ads in order to progress. on the top of that, when you upgrade your stuff, the game randomly starts an ad. to have double money, you have to watch an ad. to collect diamonds.. guess what, watch an ad. to start idle mode? yes, watch an ad. utterly disgusting, terrible design.",

It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "OK I really love this game but all if a sudden I can't play it anymore. I try to set up a match and it just hangs in the loading screen then boots me to the main menu. I have sent 2 emails to support within almost a week and more than 48 hours apart. I have not received any responses. Other than that it is a great game and for the time I was able to play I enjoyed it very much and hope to receive assistance in this matter soon so I can continue to play this wonderful game.",
        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy."

        "I absolutely love this game. The music is good, the challenges are really fun and... well, challenging. It has taken me several days of being asked by the game if I would like to review it because I was having so much fun and didn't want to stop playing long enough to review. But here you have it. This game is well deserving of a great review. I'm going to go back to the game now so I can keep on rushing.",
        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "Minus another star because it's now glitchy and no longer gives daily bonus. I'm on challenge 89 and the point accumulation is taking forever. Minus one star because the ad at the bottom gets in the way while playing. I'll be on a good run and barely graze the ad space and it stops the game and ends the run. Very frustrating.",
        "I'm obsessed with this game. It's not just playing to beat your best score. There are challenges that you can beat as you play and it makes it okay to have a bad run sometimes because you can still beat the challenge lol. Not frustrating, just so much fun. Not sure if my review makes sense, just play this game ok."

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too.",
        "Great way to relax or calm down. Lots of choices without having to earn game coin to buy more that only disappoint. Mix of both easy and challenging. One thing would improve over all play and that would be an easy way to locate any missed cells at the end of a puzzle. Having to scroll through some of those detailed ones to find one or two blanks can be a real headache! Other than than i think this is the best color game I have tried! Keep up the great work!!"

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",
        "This is really hard. I can't buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible",
        "This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control's are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!",
        "If you are looking for a fun game, this is not one of 'em. It is so annoying. It gets me is mad that I've DELETED it twice. But... when you win the levels you feel like you have just met Jesus. Also, the first few levels are easy.",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars"

        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance"

    "description" : "Six! is the latest game from Gram Games, makers of global smash hits 1010! and Merged!. This game is challenging, exciting and infuriating at times. As with all great puzzlers, Six! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points.  You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.It sounds easy, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you’ll find it’s not as easy as you originally thought.

    "descriptionHTML" : "Six! is the latest game from Gram Games, makers of global smash hits 1010! and Merged!. This game is challenging, exciting and infuriating at times. As with all great puzzlers, Six! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.<br><br>In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points.  You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.<br><br>It sounds easy, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you&#x2019;ll find it&#x2019;s not as easy as you originally thought.

        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",
        "Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It's entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Great game so far! Love the old school feel to the game! Resembles Diablo a lot! But I love the Diablo series so being able to play a game like that from the palm of my hand...GOLD! Tons of customization from characters, skills and equipment upgrades. Most of the better items are obtained just by playing! No need to buy items, save those gems for more skills to adding more companions to fight along side you! Running low on gems...just keep playing! Love a game that rewards you just for playing! Keep up the good work guys! I don't post reviews unless it's worth it so......see you out there!",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell",
        "Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I'm playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!"

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",

I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",
        "Well the reason I put a zero on the graphics was bc I didn't get to see them.😢 I just wanted to let you know that I want to request a update on the game maybe just like let people see the video chats and not the pictures. It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry.",
        "Love the whole concept, great how the phone actually rings like someone is calling you. Sadly this main novelty is hidden behind a subscription wall. Advertisements I can deal with but a subscription I point blank refuse."

        "Its awesome but why is their no idle cash when you aren't playing? I thought thats what 100 coins per min was",
        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

Aa well as all the glitches that you have to put up with... I try to do research and the times counts down but it wont show as completed although it takes your rss away which is why i bought so many packs i wasted that money just last week!!! Haven't even had time to use the things i bought and now its all gone!!!! I loved the game but i will not continue to play or spend a dime on it until this issue is resolved if i get my money back i will think about not sueing them and play the game again which i dont mind spending money on because it is fun just needs improvement and Google play needs way better customer service!!!!"

And this is first time i'm very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven't sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!",

        "Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph 😂 The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game",
        "There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.",

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "I just bought a golden crate for 100 golds, only to get a muscle ECU uncommon part. Disappointing,  no blue prints. Even in a free crate you get blue prints.  Frustrating the reward system is horrible. Am never going to buy any golden crate. Players should be given choices to buy golden crate but you get trusted upon with useless worthless part. Otherwise good game",
        "Great game, accidentally spent 100 gold buying a crate I didn't mean to because they swapped them around in the recent update. Wish they didn't do that, but i guess I should've been paying attention. All in all love this game as far as an arcade racing goes."

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

And on the racing side, idk if it's a glitch, or a feature, but I will hold the accelerator and I would lose a lot of speed in the corner (that happens irl I get it) but when I hit the straight, sometimes It'll seem like I have 400hp and then others, it'll seem like I have 4..."

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Have played this game virtually since it first started it's a great game but why do we haveto buy the gold bars we have earned throughout the games I have never spent a cent buying anything! Shouldn't most of the gold bars be awarded to us for being loyal gamers ☺",
        "At level 558 I quit this game like 2=3 years ago... Now I don't even remember how to defeat spiders etc... Thought it would be fun to start over from scratch... But of course in these games not even a chance...  Great fun... NO",
        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it's nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don't buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.",
        "DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!! I downloaded two games and completed these ridiculous tasks to earn extra \"cash\" in the game.   They both show completed and say that they've given me the reward.... but they haven't.   I disputed it.   Waiting two weeks on one of them and one week for the other.  This is racketeering.  I've been hoodwinked.. bamboozled!  I'll change my my review after they give me my CASH$$",
        "Its a great game but with one major problem. Its very hard to concentrate when the guy we are playing against is making faces after faces to mess up your concentration. Put a limit or any punishment to such behavior and i will surely change it to 5 star.",
        "I really liked this game.  But after a while when I was playing there was message saying \"waiting for opponent's connection \" so I was waiting for a long time and then nothing happened.  But I lost ALL OF MY COINS!!!!!!  can you please fix this??  Whoever made this game.",
        "The friends system is all jacked up...   I share a Facebook, we can't use Google ID to each have our own.. And even existing friends do not show up. Fun game if you don't mind playing alone in a big lonely world of emoji.",
        "Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent's card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins."

        "The reason I gave it a low rating is because this, I've had two friends she my code for an extra life and it didn't work either time. To make it worse, I've emailed them twice now about the problem and they won't get back to me on the issue. Other than that though it's not a bad game. The host talks a lot but what trivia game host doesn't?",
        "Stupid Wont let me use extra lives. Force closes randomly while in the middle of it and sometime when it starts make u miss your chance then tried to use extra life. This app sucks needs to fix force close parts. Screws me out of chances",
        "This game is so much fun to play independently and with a group. The only problem it will sometimes lag but I'm sure that's being fixed. My only two suggestions are that you can add a place where u can watch back old games because the host is so funny it would be a shame to miss out. Another would be to create a version where it is a group mode that you can play between a group of friends for fun. (Separate from the live game) Overall this game is amazing and it's amazing that there is a game everyday😊",
        "The questions are very hard!! It's fun even if you don't win! But it would be nice! Sometimes the game lags and boots me out of the game. Once I got the answer correct but the app still eliminated me! I wish they would rotate the music. Wow the pots are growing!!! Why not instead of getting extra friends for extra lives, have 3 or 4 chances to get the correct answer?",
        "The game is constantly lagging, freezing and glitching. Also do not like that I cannot change my answer even when I still have time left. The platform needs to better support the number of players that are logged on at the same time, or have a limit to the number of players so that it doesn't freeze. Cannot play properly."

So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says \"combo broken\" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!",

Now its TOO hard to gain coins to open cars and much exciting tracks.. no updates on additional tracks.. think the optjons should be reviewed. Its now once you get where you are the only way to gain more is to go online to TRY and get coins to get anywhere... which sucks!!!!!",

I just get ignored. I am truly over his game with the level of support I am receiving, which is absolutely ZERO!",

Other then that it's an OK game.  Its not been over a year and...it seems like they update this game every...6-7 months, really bad. Gets reallly boring 🤦🏽\u200d♂️",

I'm not just sticking around The same.number of credits...I don't like a lot of the gaming apps out there....they bore me quickly! I keep catching myself saying, \"ok... Just a couple more spins and I'll close it up and get something  done today....\"  Then I'll level up to unlock a new game... And who just closes the app -&gt;before at least checking it out first, Right? (kinda like hitting a baseball out of the park and walking over to the concession stands to buy some nachos before running the bases in Victory!) graphics are clear! Bonuses are fun! Good Job on putting together A Fantastic Gaming App!",
        "I just began playing Pharaoh's way tonight, I love everything about it except the two times it tried to show me some special things that are going on in the game, it freezes up and won't let me play until I completely shut it down and reboot the app. I hope you can resolve this problem! If you can, it'll be a next to perfect gaming app!",

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "Honestly, this is the best game I have ever played. It's very addicting and I think I have a very high IQ because I have beat four out of five levels in less than 3 seconds. Longest level I've played is maybe 15 seconds. I have beat the first two sets of 50 levels within about 10 to 15 minutes. I'm curious, you know how there are game runners who beat games in a record time? Is there some kind of game Runner tournament or any challenges for this game? I am beat this game completely in arecord time. Thank you developer for making the best game ever. This game can actually bring out the genius in anyone. Btw, I haven't used any hints also, I'm impressing myself... Yay!!!😎😎😎",
        "\"contains ads\" is an understatement! unless you plan on paying, dont bother.  you play a stage for 5 to 10 seconds and get an ad after EVERY SINGLE STAGE! AND THE ADS USE DATA.  videos. long ones. spammy. uninstalled.    i would have maybe paid if the game did not turn me off so quickly with their ridiculous amount of ads that made me annoyed instead. so i uninstalled instead of getting far in, and rewarding dev with $$$.",
        "Dumbest game ever! A silly trick is enough to complete 20 stages in 5 mins. Trick -&gt; Just extend the start point to the direction which you cant cover by a whole traversal! Oh forgot to tell you, out of that 5 mins, 2-3 minute is just ads!",

It did stutter for some reason on one of the levels on my galaxy s8, kept flickering for some reason but I forced closed it and restarted and no more issues. Really good job devs!",

        "Good fun and keeps you wanting another round of play. Seems to be easier as you go through, however I'm only 40 plays in, and things may change?.  I hope so. I'll be sure to play on to find out. Can't stop now! THANKS FOR A STRONG GAMEPLAY.",

After a few rounds you'll get an ad that is excessively loud if your volume is up. The content of the game is great, the ad placement is not.",

Idk but I promise I'm real. Try it out. I haven't made it too far but the puzzles are growing in difficulty."

And it is just what it says it is it's just a game like we played When We Were Young remember Cowboys and Indians this is the same thing I had a slingshot when I was young I think every little boy did it's harmless. It does not teach your child to become a murderer.",
        "It's an ok game,a little ridiculous that you can't control the hand movements. I know it has to be a challenge but unless you have some sort of a nerve disorder no one moves like that!",
        "Great if you like spamming adds and flashing buttons to spend here and there. Game itself is a turd but I've had some amazing turds before. So whatever worse then turd is.. this game is",
        "It won't save to cloud and if you can't sign in you don't get online interactive play. Can't figure it saved once, got to play head to head, but no more....great game though.",
        "I am deleting this for several reasons. 1, the physics are not real. A person's hand doesn't move like that. 2, there is an ad after just about every level. Short, but still annoying. And 3, I think a company that can't take the time to respond to it's feedback isn't worth it.",
        "Like they say, good time killer. Easy controls. Keeps you focused on game. First game I've kept downloaded after playing a couple of times in awhile. Good game."

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "Too long per word I agree with the other reviewers. My kids were giggling as they picked out each sight word the first 15 times, but by 20 they were asking if it was done yet. Is there a way to shorten the levels if the kids are getting 100% accuracy? They got through the first couple words, but now they never want to play.",
        "Rubbish I'm an adult and I found this massively infuriating let alone my kids!!! Its poor! Constantly closing for no good reason and having to progress full through the level just completed to unlock the new level. Not a good app!!!!",
        "Kids lose interest very fast Had high hopes for this game from what I've heard about it but my son's lost interest very quickly because it takes way too long for the right words to come on the screen. I would have paid for the full version if this one was good.",
        "Love it, but..... I don't understand why it doesn't save the levels. So every day he opens that up he has to redo everything. He loves it but comes to me and says that he's tired of doing level's 1-8 all the time.                Can you please make it so it can save??",
        "Kids aren't going to learn it by seeing or hearing it once, I like that it repeats. I think people lack patience these days. My only concern is some words fly across the screen too fast even I missed some and you lose a life. If that can be fixed I'd rate 5*"

        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver."

I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

        "This game is really fun, challenging at times & exercises and has a great variety of important brain exercises. My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it's the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!😀",
        "Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!",
        "Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn't deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it's to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.",
        "it is so good and not at all for the people who think their bains are going to be trained in a day. better than other apps. although I found an error in Memory Match level. when we click on an already shown image twice then the image becomes distorted also after giving multiple clicks it goes to normal so moves left and time left both decrease simultaneously. please check on the issue. rest other levels and games are superb.",
        "It's fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I've failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.",
        "I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on \"memory match\" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it's worth installing."

        "Hate it. I just hate it I just paid it have the time that controls don't work the other half the game and glitches it takes up a little too much space for me face is this plain stupid you better up playing in on your computer or laptop did you go to cool math games it's addressed really stupid it's just really stupid dont waste  your time. If you want to play it go to cool math games.  I'm done.",
        "I give this a 3 star because I can't  steer!  Yeah its easy to jump,  but when I want to turn left I turn right and die.  I wanna turn right,  I go left and die.  For me its really hard to play it.  I got to level three and then I gave up and uninstalled the game",
        "So I'm rideing in the car today and I got bored so I got my phone out and I played this game for an hour Wich felt like a second,so I did thirty levels.I thought I was legendary for a minute but I checks my gameplay and it said 1 hour.😳",
        "Since my middle school has us play cool math games I play this all the time this game is awesome and the papas games too🤗😇😎😋"

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."

And the camera (free camera) followed the truck perfectly in order to see the suspension moving with the terain. Now the camera does not stay where you want it. Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics. I unistalled other games because this is all I spent time with. But now I dont know?",

Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",

        "It starts really easy then you have to be almost an achitect to even finish the next 5 levels. Way too hard and unrealistic. Terrible game and I would not reccomend it to anyone.",
        "I enjoyed this game for about the first ten levels. It's fun and almost educational about civil engineering practices. However, after the first ten levels it becomes an infuriating cacophony of balancing your bridge on rocks and mountains without anchor points and hanging your bridge from hot air balloons. Levels become so frustratingly impossible that you are forced to watch the videos for hints to get enough stars to progress.",
        "This game is simply great. It may have adds but they are expected in a free to play mobile app. The adds are easily controlled and aren't annoying at all as they can be easily closed and come in moderation. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are cool and it's very fun and addicting. Perfect to pass time. The developers done a great job, hope for me great games made big these guys.",
        "Good game. Too bad steel wire is so expensive it's almost never useful.",
        "A good basic bridge builder sim. It is somewhat dialled back / optimised for touch screen, but works ok and the first few levels are easy enough to get the hang of. Enjoyable and worth a try :)",
        "Very good game makes you think and if u don't know well that's why there are hints."

        "Whatever you did to the graphics in the last update literally hurts my eyes. I tried playing, but the headache bonus is bogus. And why is the xp tally after finishing a round so damn loud now? Why was that necessary? I uninstalled finally. After years, there's just no way I can ignore your ruining of the game. You do realize you're not #1, right? It clearly says #5 on the app store page. You're not even #1 on iOS. lol Where are you #1 exactly?",
        "Hate the new update. When playing 4 cards, you now have to switch between screens and I have missed bingos and extra points. Is there any way to uninstall new update? Also, all the extras are missing from the screen. Where has the inventory gone? To see chat, you now have to click on the icon, then it takes up the whole screen. What makes this update better? I dont get it",
        "Latest update is horrible. Now I only have 2 cards per screen and have to scroll during game. If there is a way to get all 4 cards on one screen then you need to explain how to get it back. Also no longer says how manybingos are available when round starts. Tremendously bad update. This game went from one of the best to one of the worst. Please fix",
        "Since this game updated in feb i cant play 4 cards as explained in so many emails to bingo support. No one helps the problem dont get fixed im tired of this how can you have a support group that dont help at all. But you want good ratings for your game this is pathetic really. Im not gona issue another ticket or send emails. I think this is the worst support ive ever received",
        "To many glitches. Constantly freezing. Having 2 refresh is off putting.  Duplicates of shadow cards is ridiculous.  4 / 5 of same items. Slots don't pay out. Collecting stickers is a joke. U get the same 1s not the 1s u need. I don't spend money on games .would not waste my money",
        "It would let me play before I had to update again. I click on the open button then it comes up saying that my internet connection is not working.This game has never done this before. I just want to play my bingo games."

        "Literally unplayable. Game pauses itself in the middle of races multiple times. I am nowhere near touching the paise button and even went as far as to place my phone on the ground and touch the phone with only one finger on the accelerate button. SOMEHOW the game pauses itself 7 times during that race. Uninstalling.",
        "It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could \"ditch the glitch\" so to speak. Thanks",
        "So hard to beat the game. I'm not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can't buy anything in shop without real money.",
        "Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win",
        "Been playing for a few years and about to quit because every time I have a lead my bike goes forward by itself and starts glitching. Almost feels like I'm being cheated out of a good run. Maybe it's because I don't pay to play. Please fix or I'm deleting!",
        "The one thing that wrecks the game for me is the little hangup glitches that happen constantly.  You need to be precise to win races, and it's pretty hard to do that when the game is always stuttering.  Running on a brand new MotoZ2 Play, btw."

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

Then you will work your way up getting better gear and so forth. BUT the game is generous with ads. Too many advertisements for the little gameplay there is. The translation is spotty but works good enough for me.",
        "A very poorly designed game with limited options, countless spelling mistakes, and no reward. You scrounge up a few caps for expensive items you need to survive, just to realize that something else is needed, but no longer obtainable. It's literally a game of waiting to die. There are no options to make the next game go smoother, or any progress. Bethesda would be ashamed, that is if you even have their permission to use the content that clearly isn't yours.",
        "Falls short. Your not getting enough caps like you should and your losing health at times I personally think you shouldn't, this goes with where you don't run into anything and you just lose health is a bit too aggressive with it.",
        "This game has very little to do. You tap the screen and get random stuff or you don't.  The only thing driving the game would be the text, but with lots of lore breaks and spelling mistakes, this game falls really short from being impressive.",

        "So far, not bad.  Update:  gathered enough parts to repair the university and it won't unlock.  I emailed the developer and haven't heard back.  It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can't use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great game with good potential. I love it. But there are still some minor bugs the car baler somtimes acts weird. And the dismantling process sometimes goes reverse. And then there is the part of collecting building materials. It is too hard and we need to be able to get building materials from elsewhere than the scrap cars. All of them including wood, bricks, and concrete. I am looking forward to the car repair function.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly"

And then there is that glitch that happens a lot of times when you try to start a race and it uses your fuel but never starts, and that happens consistently. Please consider fixing the problems.",
        "I first got this game because it seemed interesting and whatnot, but I then completed the tutorial and went on to race other people but when I pressed the race button, I lost 20 energy but I didn't go on to race anyone or do anything else really. I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",
        "I really wanted to like this game and it's a great game don't get me wrong but it seems like you can't really do anything in there without watching and ad or buy something. I hated how the are so pushy with micro-transactions!",

It makes me think that you're not receiving enough money from your offers. Oh, and by the way, your offers are terrible. Nobody is going to buy things fairly priced.

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

The updates are very slow you have to wait for a while if you've gotten to a certain level,  that sucks for a real gamers.. Hopefully they get around to updating new levels faster. until then I guess I'll download something  else like chess.. Hopefully there's no long wait for updates there!",

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Great game, I totally love it. I don't mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

Great way to treat the people paying your bills."

Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game.

For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different.

I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers",

        "Fun game, I gave them some money for one of their packs. However, slightly noisy main menu with attention getting side bar is annoying.  Convoluted setup and equipment menu is a deterrent, and the fact that equipment you buy isn't permanent is terrible, thus the minus one star.",
        "Since last update I can't hit a ball to save my life, what's happened?  Some of the views are misleading so you are unable to aim your shots properly.  Also there is a degree of inconsistency with shot making so room for improvement.   Takes forever to get enough credits to improve clubs unless you spend money..  most of the offers to get credits either don't work or if taking surveys you won't be accepted.",

        "I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I have to say, I didn't have high hopes when I started. 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop and I wanted to play more. It's a different take on a Final Fantasy game, and it really does feel like a Dissidia game in RPG form. The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

        "Not bad. Uses some pretty obscure words and doesn't give you bonus for a lot of what should be bonus words. Hard to earn coins because of this as you earn very few from solving the puzzles. Clues are expensive for the reason. TIP!  TURN OFF YOUR WIFI WHILE PLAYING AND YOU CAN AVOID THE CONSTANT ADS.",

        "I love the challenging concepts. But in 2 of the levels, there was no way I could work out the clue. You cannot see a hole in the wall in level 9. Not can you figure out the code on drawers in level 11 as the colour shapes are not relevant to anything. I had to go to clue which was disappointinting and still didn't follow. Otherwise I would score game higher. A few tweaks would be nice please.",
        "Really impressed with this Escape room! I've tried several others where I don't get anywhere, it makes it no fun to play! This one is just hard enough and some easy ones as well that it makes you use your brain & have fun at the same time!!! I'm basically a beginner and got stumped quite a few times, but eventually figured it out. This is the best escape room app I've played so far! Please make more!",
        "This really got me thinking, I loved the variety in the levels. The only issue is that some levels do have steps that are impossible to figure out as there's no connection in the clues. I had to use the videos more than I would've liked. The other issue is that you can't save progress so have to start a level from the beginning if you move away from the app.  Overall a really fun game that's had a lot of thought put into it.",
        "This game deserves my 5 stars!  and I'm no doctor but this is a perfect brain teaser to help your mind grow. It's addictive and for me no matter how hard a level got I NEVER wanted to delete this wonderful app. I now mastered all the levels and now it's time for me to delete it.",
        "Me and my two kids loved this game! It took us about a week to beat it but we were so proud of ourselves when we did. The help button was very useful for us in a couple levels that we just couldn't figure out. Fun game that really makes your brain work. Can't wait for new rooms!!",
        "Beat it within a day. You have to have good logic and reasoning skills. This is one of the top escape games going. It's not like others where random items open up doors making no sense. It's more tomb raider/resident evil type escape puzzles. Great game. Need alot more of this. Good job devs. Goooooood jooooooobbbbb!!!!"

        "I love this game. It's the closest thing to tap tap revenge I've ever found. A few notes though:  There is so much lag that it seriously impedes gameplay I really like having a customizable Avatar like ttr3 I don't really like how the notes jump into the button and stay there, I like when it's smoother.  Other than that I would say this is a great game!",
        "OHMYF*CKING GOD 🤓 the nostalgia! I used to play this game back in high school and I've been saying for years that it needs to come back now that smart phones are a thing! This game is amazing and very well done, the song choices are fantastic and catchy and they've added in some extra controls during game play compared to the older tap tap.   I am so happy! Thank you developers! 😍",
        "I have loved the tap tap series way before revolution came out. I started playing this and have already noticed a problem regarding gameplay. As you play, there is the unlucky event of all the hit buttons missing, and reappearing again just for you to lose your combo, and generally lose the game. Just a little problem I have.",
        "The only issue I have with this game is as a mobile game it is flawed. Naturally since it is vertical I hold it with two hands and play with two thumbs, making the triples (one note on every part) very hard to get all perfects on. Other that truly a fun game.",
        "Its really fun and I love it, but there's a few issues. Song packs are advertised as reduced price but it's still the same price. Some songs are cut short and I don't get to play the full thing. And some good songs just have awful level design and I don't get how they even made it into the game. Can someone tell me how the hell to add friends??",
        "Have always loved this game but even on my brand new Note 8 it has a hard time registering notes that are side by side at the same time. Even if I intentionally press harder and space my fingers better. It's random but will happen consitantly through a song if that makes sense."

        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics"

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "The games are very exciting and great way to spend free time but some games take way too long to offer free spins bonus and when it does, the bonus wins are not satisfactory at all. The wins are far below expectations. in other words, the wins are way below the amount of coins spent. That's a turnoff for me. You wait so long for the bonus and get almost nothing in return. Can you please modify it so it pays a little better? All else great, the graphics, sounds and choices of slots.",

        "It's great fun!! My only problem is when I watch first position in events those fast bikes look really fake. I hope it's just how it looks and it's not the actual game physics when I unlock those bikes. My biggest problem is tournaments. They have different categories for entry cost but the high speed players can still enter and win any tier tournament below Thier skill level. They should not be allowed to dominate lower tier players",
        "If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don't mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.",
        "Great game. Only criticism is, when your racing with other players where there are lifts etc. They can bypass the lift and go over water like it's just not there. And like others have said during tournaments the leader is like 10 seconds faster and supposedly on the same bike. There must be hackers there is no way at all the bikes fly or hover. Come on guys get a grip on this so it's fair for everyone",
        "I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It's miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi",
        "Bit hard to get used to at first. But when the bikes been upgraded and Machu Pichu opened game gets much more enjoyable and less frustrating. Smoth graphics with good gameplay. Any purchase gets rid of ads but at nearly £5 for cheapest purchase it's a bit steep (and you get very little for your £5). But, all in all, a very good game that's worth sticking with.",
        "Cherishable app! I love it, just some minor problems: - Has plenty ads and never skip once when quite competition.  - Its controls should be customizable.  - Partners' profiles should be viewable.      Thank you for your help!"

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",

        "This game is really fun!! One bug I have found though is when you reset you're ascended points it gives you 20000 back no matter how many ascended points you have. For example I had 2 ascended points put them into damage reset it and got 20000 back. Gotta fix that. Over all it's a really fun game",
        "So far it's a very fun game. The music reminds me of old rpgs, and the random loot reminds me of Diablo. I'm about an hour into grinding and have only been forced to watch one 30 second ad but you have the option to watch a few more for items or perks. No bugs seen yet. I got a little happier when I left the game on and my lil hero's went into the dungeon without me.",
        "Can be very fun but is confusing at some points. For example, while attempting to ascend, you must lose the battle. Capturing beasts is also confusing and im still not sure what they are even used for. Otherwise, great game!",
        "This game gets very complicated very quickly. The game's mechanics of clicking on your character to heal them doesn't work often because the characters move quickly.  If you lock a specific item it still allows you to sell it with no notice. Overall a decent game that has too much to offer up too early.",
        "Auto play ads, and loading message on the screen at all times.  Power ups for sale at all timed.  These are the features that turned me completely away.  You should stay away too.",

        "This is a very well thought out game and I love the positive comments when I finally figure out the  way I need to go first so that the next shot is easier to get. Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don't get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys' creativity.",
        "This game was good  but could be better. I wish there was something other than just basketball. Like tennis, football, or something like that. Graphics were good. This game is addicting but it's hard to get past level 20 if you don't have Facebook. So I'm stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better",
        "Had to lower my stars. You have to use all the retry and balls a couple times just to figure out levels. Then u play 1 level and u wait for more energy. Same ole money app pay to play. Was ok until higher levels. Now it drives me crazy. Good game though just can't play it much.",
        "This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can't get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don't know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun",
        "Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That's truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that's ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I'm back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can't wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.",
        "Would be better if you could do everything without Facebook cos that sorta limits options for some people. Also could you please get rid of the energy bar? That makes things hard. But like that you put your actual voice in it."

        "Fabulous game! I absolutely flew past all the episodes and the online save feature works fantastically well. I successfully recovered gameplay from about 6 months ago. I got back my progress and all my gold. One of the best games out there :)",
        "Definitely a relieving break from the onslaught of talking Tom spin offs.. This game here is the most redneck tower defense kind of game you could get, and I love that. It's a standard shooting tower defense game, but with variety in enemies and even multiplayer! Who woulda thought?",
        "IT can be scary because it fell like you go lose but then it fell. Better because you won i JUST GOT THIS GAME 🎮  2min ago and am on leavel 5 GANG GANG AM A GIRL",
        "Fun best game, easy to play and all i can say is fun as hell. I guess i could be more fun if you add some gore effect or blood splat. Super fun if you can see the bullets hit them.",
        "I've loved this game for such a longtime!!  I always make sure I download game whenever I upgrade to a new phone...it doesn't bother me to start all over bcuz I could play this game from beginning to end everyday!!  Game actually allows u to start where u left off but many times I choose to start from beginning..i wonder if there's ever going to be a sequel to swamp attack...swamp attack 2, swamps revenge??  Lol...i HOPE SO!!!"

I don't know what d problem is please tell me a solution",
        "It would be a really good game if it stops letting me use my coins then when I'm in the game for not even 5 seconds. It would shut down on me and when I login back in my coins are gone. I will like you to fix that",
        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",

Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn't that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven't played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!",
        "It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don't have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I'll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.",
        "AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It's scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory's and watching theorists make more theory's. Amazing game and it's worth the money!",
        "Great! Even though this is only the demo, it is amazing. Just playing the demo made me nervous, but despite that I am purchasing the full game. (Luckily) I was able to complete the demo when I played it, so I am a valid advice giver to anyone who tries the demo. My advice: Get the demo. It is great. Another piece of advice is don't waste your battery. I was able to complete the demo with three bars of my battery left. The last piece of advice I'll give is to keep an eye on Bonnie.",
        "Force Close I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN ANY LIVING SOUL!! And then it doesn't work!? It's an awesome game and I would never hate, but is there any way that you can fix this? And I was also wondering if u can make the demo free for the first game out as well. Thanks Scott :)",
        "This game is scary for me because purple man jumpscares me a lot and am 9 years old. Scott thanks for making it but I will gave it 5 stars if you put a warning sign that says that there coming. Also if you could make the flashlight with more power and make it go to other nights and hard. But this game is scary and cool"

        "Great concept, design and execution. The game is simple to play but extremely hard to master, along the lines of Flappy Bird, and more closely, QWOP. The design language is innovative and intentionally sketch-like, but the physics of leg motion are hilariously realistic. There's no elaborate story (which makes this great for casual gameplay) but the motions, expressions, costumes and messages provide a compelling setting and get us to get quite fond of the clumsy main character.",

The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",

After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",

Clearly the developers don't know Android as well as iOS, which doesn't give the option of exiting gracefully like Android...",
        "Only thing I'd like to see changed is to have the option to skip all the whooptedoo after winning a game. First couple times, it's cute, but by the dozenth time it gets tedious. Apart from that, I'm a happy player. (EDIT, a couple months later...) Another real nuisance is the continual request for a 5-star rating even after I'd given one. As a consequence, I've lowered my rating. Still worth playing, but there's serious nuisance value.",
        "I've played many solitaire games, but i love this one. Because I can play on my tablet horizonally. And the part on bottom  moves out of way..playing this way doesn't interfer with my charging cable. ty for great game",
        "I've played this game multiple times and have noticed a repeated pattern in the way the cards are dealt. No sure why the developer would do this. Maybe to keep the win rate at about 20%",
        "It's solitare... how cool can it be? Biggest issue in my opinion would be being told I made the leader board but not even in the top 20... I mean who cares at that point."

        "Its pretty great overall but I dont like the fact that I cant expend anymore after level 60. Id love more space since you need to put lots of decorations for challenges . I also think there should be hearts every good bubble not just one out of 3ish. When you need 100 hearts its a long time getting them. Besides that very great game, still play it!",
        "Sadly I have decided today to uninstall this game. I've been really enjoying it but it is simply too resource hogging for me and keeps crashing. I think it needs an option to turn off animations especially when building etc.  EDIT. Since getting a newer, faster Samsung tablet the game has improved for me immeasurably. Excellent!",
        "Amazing game! Very similar to the original RC Tycoon, but a few added changes to make it more interesting. I've only encountered one major glitch where my park was erased and instead was given a friend's (I still had all coins, tickets, cards) but I had to rebuy whatever rides and buildings I had that my friends park didn't BUT they reimbursed me for it and gave me enough coins to rebuild my park (probably twice over thh). So overall a great game and great customer assistance too!",
        "Usually ill make it to level 10 in other games like, but this has been the only one that can hold my attention for so long. Just hit level 40 a figured it deserved a review! 5 stars from me! I love that you dont have to wait for anything. The missions just keep popping up regardless of how many you finish. If I didn't have any responsibilities I could literally play all day long.",
        "My very first tychoon game and I love it. Very addicting! Can't stop playing. Such fun building your own amusement park. Could have a tutorial you can click on whenever you need to know how to play but, other than that, really good game."

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",

If you're trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players."

        "Graphics are good. The app can eat up ram and CPU a bit, but for a game this detailed and expansive it's to be expected. The controls aren't quite as accurate to actual touch locations as I'd like, but other than that, this is a lot of fun. The original game, Black and White, was great!!! And this is to. Different features to the game, but that, too, is to be expected. You can choose to watch ads to aid your progress, but they are not intrusive, which I appreciate greatly. The game really isn't challenging in the beginning, but I haven't gotten far. This is totally worth the download. Great, great job devs, thanks for all the hard work!!!!",
        "I have shelved all of my other games to focus on my addiction to this game! Great graphics, amazing concept and very little ads compared to other free apps out there! I do wish there was more information available on how to increase the happiness of your followers... as it seems that no matter how much you build and gift and inspire they are always behind the Astari! A little work in developing a help section would go a long way! And some more diverse purchase packages would make it more appealing to pay!",
        "This is the best game I've downloaded from the playstore, ever. It doesn't bombard you with ads and you get sooo much content! You even have the option to watch an unlimited number of ads for free gems if you so choose, and gem costs for items are totally reasonable. The story is cute and interesting and the graphics are pleasing. The controls are also very user friendly. It's been like three weeks and I'm still addicted. Superb work guys!!",
        "This game is mesmerising. The graphics seem simple, but they are so elegant and beautiful. The background music is good too. Edit: I got addicted to the game, and that cause its a game that absorbs you in. I had previously rated it 5 stars but now, the game won't open at all. It stops working every time, is all my progress lost now?",
        "Was looking for a settlers type game when I found this.I love it. It is a calm and addictive game. Love the story boxes ,I can't wait to complete the story, (I bet mrcreepypasta on YouTube would knock a narration out the park). Really enjoy the landscaping element, just waiting on the seabed ability now. Only bugbear I have is stickers seem to be very difficult to obtain. It seems boxes are few and far between once grey cleared areas have been checked.",
        "Seems like it could be a cool game. Didn't mind the ads until they started just playing the sound on a black screen. Timer runs out and no x to continue. I restart the app but I have to get past an ad to open a pretty important menu. (Galaxy note 8)"

Furthermore, it seems the only people who play anymore are the weirdos who just write the word instead of draw so you can guess, which makes the whole game pointless. Like, the heck, dude? They want all the points and none of the fun. Ruins the entire app because that's all you ever get anymore.",

        "Too many ads! I liked this game years ago, forgot about it and recently downloaded again. I would of hoped that things would of improved but no. The annoying \"do you need a bomb\" keeps popping up non stop. Wish they would of added more brushes by now since it's a drawing app, it just makes drawing much harder since I use it on my mobile phone. A paint bucket would also be nice instead of coloring the whole page.",
        "Redownloaded this game after not playing for a while and it's pretty similar to before, but the amount of push notifications is making me uninstall again. I have notifications turned off in the app, yet I still get a push notification what seems like every hour. It's so unnecessary. So I am happily deleting this app again.",

        "The game it's self isn't bad, it's the notifications that's annoying. Even if you turn notifications off you get them 4 or 5 times a day. It's pretty annoying."

        "The fast pace of the game keeps you hooked.  They don't throw ads at you but certainly make them available for great benefits.  It's not clunky at all which makes it easy to pick up and play a couple minutes here and there.  It's a ridiculous concept of making money off taxis/fares, heck I'd move to the cab driver profession if I made &gt;$500 million on one fare... but funny and fun nonetheless.",
        "I really like this game a lot. I'm not usually into these idle games, but from all the ones ive tried. Ive enjoyed this one the most. Other then the occasional slow down, it mostly runs great. And the model for ads is very very fair. If you decide to watch and ad, you always get some kind of reward out of it. But its completely optional.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Huge battery drain compared to any other game i have played including the new tekken and sims mobile games which are much more graphical. Will sometimes lose game progress when you completely close the app (so not running in background). Taxi's occasionally get stuck on buildings or vanish off screen completely. If it wasn't for these issues it could be a much better game.",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like."

        "Oh boy this way funny! I think my ears are going to burst! XD Anyone who gets it, try playing a song backward or in overlord. IT IS HILARIOUS!!!   You did a great job on the effects, and even when i had the ghost playing the brightest song it sounded creepy. The dragon also made me want to hide as it sounded like it was stomping around as the music blasted through my ears.  Overall, great app. I might be using it on halloween... XD",
        "The app works wonders! The cathedral effect is my favorite (it also makes your voice sound a thousand times better, lol). There are some effects I'm not a big fan of, though, and I think they're not that interesting, such as Poltergeist, Android, Cyborg or Devil. Still, this is the best app for voice effects!",
        "This is the best app! You don't need to talk or to record your own voice in order for this app to change your voice. All you have to do is to type what you want to say and.... That's all! You git my 5 Star, greetings from Philippines",
        "This app is surprisingly a pretty efficient and versatile little gizmo! It has actually quality effects and is super easy to use. I find myself downloading it again and again whenever I need sound stuff, because I keep getting roped into bigger fancier apps that get too complicated and expensive.",
        "I like how you change your voice and record anything like barks, nerf guns, singing and growls. It might be cool if you added a GROWN-UP voice effect you know for kids, plus people who are already grown up could see what they'd sound like double grown-up! PS: Your video \"IS very funny\" No, it wasn't funny, IT WAS HILARIOUS! :D",
        "Nice effects, but Death, Dragon, Evil Puppet etc. All sound very familiar. I think the Death one should have a much more echoey scratchy voice, Dragon should be super loud, superior, scratchy. Same with the fly, shrinking, and small person etc. They all have super squeaky voices  Make them differ And maybe add a girl voice and a man voice so you can just be plain man or plain girl :p Its very good and I like how you can record it, so I can now troll people with the zombie voice."

        "The amount of ads is ridiculous! Especially from that \"Tune Blast\", it's really annoying. And, w/some of the ads you have to wait 30sec before they're done, there's no \"x\" button. The actual mahjong game itself is decent.",

        "Great game but on small problem. I can usually get the easy ones done in 10-17 minutes, until I get to an A. Ries \"easy\" puzzle. When I do those it turns into 45-50 minutes. I can do the medium puzzles in just under that time.  I think they are misclassified and should be look at. Other than that they controls are great and provides good entertainment! Ty.",
        "Never mind.  Took me awhile but I finally figured out the system.  Maybe I'm just not seeing it but when I come back to playing I can't tell which puzzles or packs I've completed.  Could we have a check mark or change of colour or counter bar to indicate which packs or puzzles have been completed?  Easy controls and easy to see size for my tablet.  There are some ads if not purchased but they don't pop up unexpectedly and are quickly closed after just a few seconds.  I wish other dev's would take note of this.  Since I will only be using easy to medium puzzles I probably will not pay nearly $7.00 but if it ever goes on a 50% off sale I just might buy.  THANK you for your reply.",
        "This is a really good crossword puzzle app. I'm not too keen on the ads. It is obviously American so us Brits do have to really think on some of your more homegrown clues. All in all I am thoroughly enjoying it as it keeps the little grey cells working.",
        "Great game. Good mix of easy - challenging puzzles. Only complaint is that when the app is open, even in the background, it will cause my spotify app to pause music every couple minutes, so I am unable to listen to music while playing which can be frustrating. But that being said, I still thoroughly enjoy this app!",
        "The game is well made. The content is often lacking. There should be report features for crosswords that are incorrect. Larry H has several mispellings in his crosswords, making them nearly impossible. \"Aron\" and \"Navaho\" are so blatantly wrong, I wish he couldn't submit his crosswords anymore",
        "Excellent puzzles! Sometimes a bit USA orientated (sports & politics) but general knowledge is universal. The hard level is really hard, easy makes you think hard too sometimes. Does not use up data in the background. Recommended."

        "Love the game. It's fun and interactive but have only hit bonuses and free spins on the first game. Been playing for awhile now and not once did I hit the Wheel of Riches or What's in the box. It's bit deceiving that you have to increase your bet to activate the Wheel of Riches or What's in the Box when it rarely or never hits. At least allow those to hit once every thousand spins or something.",
        "This game is awesome. Love the graphics, sounds, and games. Makes me smile everytime Ellen talks. Silly I know but I absolutely love Ellen and this game is amazing. My 3yo son loves taking turns with mommy and we absolutely love the bonus games! He laughs and gets excited everytime we win!!! I wish I could give it a million stars!!!! HEY ELLEN MAKE A KIDS LEARNING GAME TOO PLEASE!!!! but seriously this game is relaxing and fun! If you haven't downloaded it yet, DO IT!!!!! ♡♡♡",
        "My mom loved you so much. She passed away Dec. 18th. She would've loved this game you have. I play in honor of her memory and well, i love you to. Been a fan since before your johnny carson appearance. Wish i could go to your show and play a game for the fun of it and to meet you. Sincerely, Tim Simpson",
        "Ellen, love the candles that light up to spell your name. Clever. The reels in your games are Hurkey jerkey. Smooth is better. Solo, where is the box in What's in the Box? Where is the reel in wheel to riches? Your pay outs are much better on max bet. Took me a while to get to 100M. Keep up the creative good work.",
        "I keep watching the ads to get extra coins and none of them get awarded. I never get the wheel of riches or multijackpots or what's in the box no matter how high I play. I've played SO MANY times on the #Imatellen one and the heart emoji is as big as it gets but I've never gotten the bonus game. These glitches are ridiculously frustrating. Honestly if they don't get fixed soon I'm just gonna delete and find a different casino app.",
        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !"

Thank you for reading this it took me 2 min.to type it",
        "This game is so edicting. I only just got it and ime loving it. I allredy have a rell chanel but this game makes making a vidio simple and fun. All you have to do is tap pres publish and boom you get nice coments good vuis and nice suggestions. Man oh man am i adictid to this game. Good adictid it really really is such a good game. That my freind is why i gave it 5 stars and recomend it to evry one. It is just as good if not better than peudiepies tuber simulator. So pleas get this one",
        "I get that free games have ads. That's fine. But you can't get 20 taps in or switch to a new tab before you get another 30/50 second ad. I thought this was just a fluke, but it keeps happening every 30 seconds like it's on a timer. This game would be fantastic other wise. Uninstalled it after the first half hour.",
        "I found that this game is so addicting till you got like 100000 views ever second... then it becomes very boring... but I do recommend it to people who want a game to play for like 2 weeks but don't expect any big reward for play long... I just want tapps to make something rewarding to getting higher like designing your gaming setup or actual able to make a video and upload it to the game... overall good game",
        "Surpisingly fun.    I'm not a big fan of clicker games, but this is defiantly worth it. The game is not overwhelmed with adds, and you get to customize your character. However, when you reach a certain point in the game, Its not fun anymore. Tiers just take time because of the progress gap, and there is basically nothing to do. If they added more stuff after you reach the top, I would rate 5 stars. Can you please add a update to fix this issue?",
        "Surprisingly fun. I'm iffy on idle clicker games but the reviews convinced me; there's lots of unique aspects to this game that other clicker games don't have. It's competitive, which is cool, and you can actually customize the upgrades. The main thing that makes me stay away from idle clickers is that there's no customization. In this game you can customize your room and yard, character, and even choose the videos you post. Lots of fun stuff to do, definitely worth a try."

This is the only logical, fun and satisfying bursting games I've played till now!   Just one suggestion, you should give more ammunition for the black balloons rounds.   Great game! 👍",
        "I was looking for a simple game to kill a little time and that didn't require too much concentration. This fit the bill perfectly. I didn't care about point scores but if you do you might find this a bit frustrating because the point scoring is pretty ambiguous. Otherwise this is a simple but fairly entertaining diversion that can be played for a long or short session while you're trying to fill some spare time.",

        "It's the best. While I am babysitting  my young grandchild(1Yr)old  he can help me play too. It is the best game ever even  my husband wanted to  install it.",
        "I've downloaded this game several times and when I get over level 100 the game doesn't load the next level. I wish they would fix this gliche."

Bug: Any score above 19 doesn't get registered for some reason. I got a highscore of 19 and after that even if I get 22-25 kills, the new highscore is never saved. I think the app is not counting the added points for headshots.",
        "Great game, but what's next? Have the Spear of Infinity (cool) and have reached 420 kills. What about an exploding spear (BOOOM) that clears the entire field. Especially those fireball buggers. More aggressive opponents too would be nice :-)  Thanks for a fun game to pass the time with. Cheers!",
        "Great game. Too many ads EVEN AFTER YOU PURCHASE THE ADD FREE UPGRADE. Point scoring makes no sense. Upgrades are practically useless. A few tweaks would make this game a classic. Unfortunate that the developers have chosen to be greedy and lazy.",
        "Absolutely love it, two suggestions though to perfect it. A sensitivity adjuster for finer aiming would be cool, but most importantly, could we please have an option to select a single background colour. It's jarring having the background changing all the time. Great work though!",
        "I really do enjoy this game. but it had suggested I download another of one your games called \"vikings\" in exchange for 900coins. afterwards there were none awarded or no indication of how I would recieve them. I hate stupid ploys like this or even miss direction whatever it may have been. I'm actually considering deleting the app because of it.",
        "I unlocked one of the special abilities and it is hard to use in gameplay.  I would be in a game and as an enemy shot an arrow at me I tried to click the small button on the bottom right corner but I wasn't able to because it was too small.  I would suggest that you make the button bigger for convenients. Thank you."

Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards. You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game.

        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",
        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "This should be called Army Men Drama Field... This Game is a Joke along with the consultants you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than getting a hold of anyone. And it's like being in pre school you can get banned for saying a bad word 🤣 i wouldnt waste my money or time on this game"

        "Cost of everything in the game is particularly high. And gems??? Don't even get me started.  They just dropped some limited time dragons in the game, and the cost of EACH them is OVER $100 if you haven't been able to earn that many gems in game yet.  Which takes a very, very long time.  Uninstalling today, casual players beware.",
        "Very relaxing game. I wouldn't say it's a \"time killer\" because after playing for hours you'd probably spend a lot of cash out of your pocket, if you don't want to pay this game calls for lots of patience. If you have PATIENCE you will NOT have to buy anything. I've been playing for almost 2 years now and I have only spent 30$ on the game and not because I felt like i had to but because I just wanted to; to speed the game play up a bit. I have gotten every dragon so far, even the event dragons, and limited time dragons, etc. Without  having to spend any gems. Sometimes it takes days of breeding the same pair but it will work if your persistent and patient! :)",
        "Concept-wise the same as with many breeding games. It's fun, a nice game to have for here and there.  Generally good ideas were implemented into this game. Most dragon designs are really good. Unfortunately I don't understand some of the mechanics in the game like removing something from the market makes you lose this item? I mean the last time I have opened a market on the street, I kept my things I put for sale. :? Please fix those logic flaws.",
        "It's fun enough if you don't take it too serious. I could write a long review but I was in the middle of playing when the game kept asking for a review, kind of annoying. But in all honesty this is one of two games I have consistently played for a long time now, so I really do like it.",
        "I really love this game...i have this one and the other DragonVale. I have alot of fun with my grandkids breeding the different dragons. I will say tho that I would have given this 5 stars all the way across if it didn't take so long to get some of the dragons. We have been trying for the Knarr dragon for months and can not get it. It is very frustrating. If it wasn't for the new events that give us a chance to breed new dragons I am afraid I would have uninstalled this due to it taking wayyyyyyy to long to breed certain dragons.",
        "I've been playing this game for a LONG time. And it continues to keep my interest! It's so fun! And with the constant release of new dragons and events, it stays fun. I wish there were more events, but Hey! It's a great game! Expand that market place though..."

        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I'm going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again."
