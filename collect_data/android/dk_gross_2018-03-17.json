        "This game is amazing.  I play several of the spin/build games, but nothing is like this one.  There is so much things that you can do.  I now have my mom, brother, sister, aunt and cousin playing and still bugging other friends and family to play.  Thanks for a great game. LOVE IT",
        "Something has happened.. I am currently playing the attack master event. I have attacked 20 times at least. But the metre only indicates 6 attacks. Everytime I attack I see hammers going to the metre but the number there remains the same. I would have gotten 12 million and evemln more but due to this issue I haven't. It's definitely the fault of game. Please fix it as soon as possible.",
        "Very frustrating to have to work for weeks to earn enough to build in the higher levels and have it constantly being destroyed because in three days worth of spins you only receive 2 shields... not to mention the rarity of free spins (maybe once a week) Game is an exercise in frustration and not worth the download.",
        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",

The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",

And one more thing, Can you explain why I have to wait over 2800 minutes for my next life? It's been 3 days and it went from 2800 minutes to 2300 minutes! Based on your stupid calculations each day is equal to 170 minutes? Give me your supports group email add and I will send you a screenshot!",

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

        "On level 2185, had over 800 different boosters and suddenly all of them are gone, serious glitch in game... emailed their tech center for over 1 week now and only get a automated response and nothing from a real person. Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks"

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",

I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",

Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "This garbage is nothing like ads show. It's a pay to win mmo that brings nothing new to the table. You can always tell a game will be garbage when their ads are fake. Uninstalled!",
        "Unless you are willing to line their pockets with cash your wasting your time on the game.  You'll never catch up to those who have been playing the game a long time without money.  Parents beware.",
        "Absolutely no support available in the game.  If you're able to take money, people should be able to contact you.  Game is also geared for higher level players to advance by ganging up on new players.   I was attacked 19 consecutive times in a 5 minute period with 6 players attacking me at once.  In short, don't waste your time"

        "I am really disappointed that it takes so much to upgrade each time is insane. I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!",
        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",

You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",

        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

        "great game! auto play is helpful for players who do not have a lot of free time in the real world. eats up battery like a fat kid at a buffet.   not worth downgrading a star but I noticed there is no audio mute option, just turn down volume bar as far to the left. So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",
        "It's been ok so far, I personally don't enjoy the auto feature but I get why it's there... I'm a busy person I have other stuff to do while I really want to game. Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",
        "Not only is it laggy, now after loading and installing the recent update, I can't even log in. After log in screen and after it checks for any update, it logs me out to main menu! This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",
        ".... Like the 100 or more people before me after the March 14th update I'm no longer able to log in for some unknown reason.. No info on the netmarble site about this issue which is odd.. I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",
        "Ok new review, I've passed all 1740 levels would have given 5 stars but the upper levels can only be passed when you hit the right program! Play same level 20-30+ times then suddenly pass with 10-15 moves left!!! Not fun anymore!!! Uninstalled",
        "This game was my favorite, however the lack of being able to reset the game is truly sad 😢 and takes away from my joy of the game! Please give the option for us to reset our play easily, please 💕",
        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

        "It's a really great game but there are some flaws to it. First of the game is reall laggy for me and tends to always disconnect me in a game and I fell as if the reporting thing doesnt work either because they are never really blpcled for a while but those are tge only things but overall its an amazing game",
        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",

        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜",
        "This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven't experienced anything toxic, yet. I've been playing for about a week and it's really great"

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "It's bloody fantastic I haven't played it for years but the game flows better than it first came out keep up the good work 👍",
        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",
        "Its a good game but the rewards for tickets are rubbish , last 6 times i claimed gold reward for 1000% more cash , its given less than 200,000 which is rubbish get more for the bronze , needs sorting",

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with.

So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning.

        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio."

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

    "descriptionHTML" : "Join your friends in a brand new 5v5 MOBA showdown against real human opponents, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang! Choose your  favorite heroes and build the perfect team with your comrades-in-arms! 10-second matchmaking, 10-minute battles. Laning, jungling, tower rushing, team battles, all the fun of PC MOBAs and action games in the palm of your hand! Feed your eSports spirit!<br><br>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, 2017&#x2019;s brand new mobile eSports masterpiece. Shatter your opponents with the touch of your finger and claim the crown of strongest Challenger!<br><br>Your phone thirsts for battle!<br><br><b>Features:</b> <br><br><b>1. Classic MOBA Maps, 5v5 Battles</b> <br>Real-time 5v5 battles against real opponents. Fight over 3 lanes to take the enemy&#x2019;s tower. 4 jungle areas. 18 defense towers. 2 Wild Bosses. Complete reproductions of classic MOBA maps. Full-on 5v5, Human vs. Human battles. A triumphant return to genuine MOBA gameplay.<br><br><b>2. Win with Teamwork &amp; Strategy</b> <br>Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team or be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!<br><br><b>3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory</b> <br>Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Winners and losers are decided based on skill and ability on this fair and balanced platform for competitive gaming. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.<br><br><b>4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master</b> <br>With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target sifting allow you to last hit to your heart&#x2019;s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system lets you focus on the thrill of battle!<br><br><b>5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches</b> <br>Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds, and battles last 10 minutes, glossing over the quiet early-game leveling up and jumping right into intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling action and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.<br><br><b>6. Smart Offline AI Assistance</b> <br>In most MOBAs, a dropped connection means hanging your team out to dry, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&#x2019;s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you&#x2019;re offline, your character will be controlled by our AI system to avoid a 5-on-4 situation.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE! Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money.

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

Aces, review by Da1 G Reaper of the Sun Tzu Ghosts Gaming Community... #livfreeplyhard #STGGC",
        "Good luck in this game if ya don't want to spend money. No game balancing meaning a lvl12 can attk lvl  1 with no post attk shield or protection of any kind. Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",
        "Hi A.K server 52. Have been playing for couple of months now and still love the game.just when you think you are on top of things something new comes up. I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.

Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and addicting, with patience.  My only complaint is that everytime i die,  which is often,  i lose all my stuff and can never find my body again.  I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",
        "WARNING: every time you update the game, it cannot connect to your google play account for god knows how many hours or even days! The risk of losing all your progress is VERY high. If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",
        "I love the game. But seriously? You get 1 energy every 5 minutes and at minimum need 13 energy to get somewhere... Also why do you stop letting us watch ads? It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",
        "I'm done with this game... I have spent hours on it and despite being level 99 the game has stagnated. This latest update... Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",
        "Dog update just lost all my data including motorcycle, nearly finished acid bath, and atv, cement base with maxed out trunks, loads of stuff. Played every day for months to have it all wiped away in 1 update. They have done this repeatedly to others and yes it was connected to playstore. I have restored it before. This time it doesnt connect!"

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

AND THEN WHEN THE NEW UPDATE COMES OUT.... I LOSE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you PLEASE give me the stuff back.",

I don't know if I were think too much but I feel like Everytime I level up, the weapon that I use before was unexpectedly weaker.Lucky chest seem to drop only coins and crysrals(sometimes I got free spin). And some modes, weapons and armor balance is not really that balance (example:last match I used smart bullet bazooka to kill people using 4 rockets to kill them. But he killed me with only 2 rockets of smart bullet bazooka...... How is that even balance?!). I hope you fix this soon. Because I love to play game.",

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything.

        "Dear team, It's really a awesome game ever. I'm playing it since 2 years. Very addictive. But i request you to all, when we start a TEAM RACE many players join clans for playing team race n take efforts in team race for getting better reward but many of them team leaders kick players just before ending the team race n players won't receieve any reward for it. It was happened with me 2 times. So please do any update for those players who take much efforts in team war and then also they get nothing. Thanks",
        "This game used to be 5 star. They've changed it where all team events are gem sucks. You have no chance of winning without using a considerable amount of gems. They've taken away most in game free ways to get gems, and to buy them is not worth it, they're very over priced. It's not a team event, it's a paid for event. If they change it and make it more fair for everyone I'll make a new rating.",
        "It's a nice game with so many awesome monsters. I like it and it's my favourite game in this category. My suggestion is that if you can include an option to cancel ongoing breeding by giving gold or gems or without anything, it would have been better. The game has events that comes very frequently, it helps so much in getting new monsters and or progressing in the game.",
        "The game is awesome! The game play, the monsters, and also the actual fighting and graphics. This is one of my most rated games and my most played; I couldn't go a day without it. It's competition is so good online with people and in dungeons and the map, also team wars are fun with your friends. Get this game you'll never regret it.",
        "DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. Recently my account was reset due to the game posting the wrong price of gems. I have lost everything even the things I paid full price for. I have been robbed of gems, cells, gold, food and my time. If you do play the game, don't spend actual money because they can take it all away. BE CAREFUL"

If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",

The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",

        "It's pay to win for sure. However, if you play daily and stick to monthly and quarterly cards you'll rack up gems and heroes quickly. It took me over a year to get my VIP high enough to get the monthly meta heroes. I get an hour or two a day out of it and even when I didn't have the monthly paid heroes I had a fun time. I don't mind spending $15/month for the amount of time the game helps me kill.",
        "I'm a paying customer, which they call \"VIP\" but you best believe you are far from important. I had an issue with a purchase in December, but support takes a week per message to reply and isn't useful at all about the issue and tells you they can't help. Should have let Google refund the money before the 48 hours instead of giving their support a chance.",
        "Don't download the game . If u want to win u must spend thousands dollars. A huge skins with control every month 2 new heroes with amazing power. Every month making new heroes and the old ones getting trash. Random game no strategy. Just click for pic. Ucool don't do anything. Don't download!!! I played more than one year and every month it's getting worst. The forgetting about players. They think only for cash. Ucool one of the worst organisation..if u don't spend a money please don't start the game .nice pictures  and that it )))",
        "This game was a very well balanced game between free play gamers and those that put money into it. Not anymore. If you want to be competitive you must put handreds of dollars each month (no joke). Very dissapointed in the way this game has become.",
        "A very good game but a pay to win. I myself paid 73$ and I am VIP 8. This game can be fun without paying but to get the most out of it atleast  buy an annual card for 30$. If you have even more to throw away try buying all the cards when they run out get a new one. (Mainly Annual and Season Card. Week card isn't a must have). Also if you are new to the game wait for a new server to start. That way you wont fall behind. I am on server 210 and have also played on server 207. I was in this game when it was brand new and purple heroes were the best. I was in 1 of the 1st servers and f2P I quit the game at lvl 50 though. All in All if you want to play this game prepare 100$",
        "The menu is very unresponsive when scrolling. Also, when killing enemies, particularly after using a special ability, the enemy simply freezes and then fades away - there's no animation for the death of the enemy and this is disappointing and detracts from the immersion. Otherwise it's a good game, but significantly more heroes would be necessary to keep me interested."

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAİN that SYSTEM DİVİSİON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER DİVİSİON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is 👌 I love it",
        "This season I really put in a big effort to try and win the treble. Got the best players, do all the training, strategy ect. All for nothing. Lost against a crappy team in semi of Cup. Apparently according to IA it wasn't my day. Like I said before, game is pre programmed. Dev's do nothing about the gameplay, they rather concentrate on silly add ons which can make them money. Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs",
        "I think u guys should find a way for us(we the managers) to get tokens easier . I don't understand why winning the league or champions league only gets you money but no tokens . it really sucks"

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

It can be the best fun ever. But it exponentially grows so you'll never hit the top without continual spending .  Miss all the wonderful peeps but refuse to be a whale or a cash cow .",
        "Money grab. Unless you have $300 a week to spend on this never ending money pit, you will never go anywhere in this game. You can only get so far, then you a required to spend actual cash to continue playing. If you want to max out your base you better have DEEP pockets. This is not a joke, if you want to be a serious player, it will cost you around $300 a week just to keep up. Only the rich get anywhere in this game.",

One cyber Titan can zero anything that has highest normal T52 troops and best bio titans...... without sending a commander Once u reach building level 1100 offered for less than 19.99 USDyou will have no access to packs less than $100 USD and no access to RSS for older troops",
        "I use to have one of the strongest bases in MKST.. Mistress Vixen..nickname Vix.  Anyhow i have spent easily around $3,000 us dollar on this game. And one day my shield lapsed and I got zeroed after about 40 plus hits. I quit playing. I started back and spent  littke money cause I missed my alliance people I started to consider family after almost a year of play.  Anyhow now they came out with cybernetics and the packs for that are $99.00 everytime. I'm sorry this has went to far. This is a pay to play game 100%.",
        "Lots to do to increase your power, tons of new buildings giving massive power boosts, just wait a little bit & you may get lucky with a $99 pack being reduced to $19. Make sure you have plenty of money for this game. If you don't have the money, then starting out new, you'll be at a stand still around HQ level 20 & commander level 50, with only increasing power by researching, training more troops, & building traps for your wall. This game has been slowing down a lot lately though, not sure if it's the game or my phone causing it.",
        "U spend money to get ready for war.I think I am ready too go to cp and look at the other players base and think I am going to die. Their lvl and power are bigger than mine, so I spend more money an that still don't help for the event this game is starting to suck. My res base I have never spent no then on it and I have it Hq lvl 350 what is up with that. Helping a base who has not spent no money. Help the people who has spent money"

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",
        "This should be called Army Men Drama Field... This Game is a Joke along with the consultants you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than getting a hold of anyone. And it's like being in pre school you can get banned for saying a bad word 🤣 i wouldnt waste my money or time on this game"

        "I was expecting this to come out soon, after all another build a medieval city clone. Nothing original about it. I play it only because of GOT theme. How to keep people playing? -Don't make the screen so congested. -Make stuff like buying a second builder permanent, not for 2 days.  -Basically don't make it P2W. If you don't get what I mean look up how EA messed up with Starwars Battlefront 2",
        "Alliances are complicated but use the chat feature and folk will tell you or PM you. It does take up a bit of time..IF YOU LET IT, but overall, not a bad game. Loads to do...follow what tyrion tells you. Wish I could find particular resources for crafting or I'm never gonna have a level 10 helmet haha. Have fun...don't let it rule your life",
        "12 days is an unacceptable amount of time to respond to a paying customer's problem. Is this the only way to get attention of WB? I have submitted ticket 5 times with no answer!",
        "Real truth! This game is built on your discourage to upgrade without buying. You can increase your castle but you have to spend real money all the time. Their rewards vs investment is 10% for you. You will spend your whole credit on this and still not be eligeable for the iron Throne. This is WB best scammed game out there! Things you 400 of to upgrade, only come as 6 units or less a month which pushes you to buy 100$ packages to upgrade. WB is laughting at you!",
        "Too expensive. The in-app purchases cost about 5-100 €. Those players who pay that on a regular basis dominate and win the game. Those players who don't are currently about 50 times smaller. It is like fighting off tanks and stealth bombers with flintstone and spears. You will lose.",
        "Great game, I like all the references to the show (the maester's tower, the different kingdoms/seats of power, etc.) I think the leige and alliance system is a bit complicated and I think the graphics could use a little work but other than that I really like it."

Would keep people playing more and they would have more purchases! That's how I'd rack in the bucks if it were my app!",
        "2ND UPDATE: 3/21/18- Thank you for adding new bathrooms and bathroom rugs! Thank you also for giving new, unique furniture on 5th or 7th consecutive days. Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",
        "I like this game but it's frustrating how it's hard to get stars and then they want you to waste them on things like giving the cat a bath... I want to decorate the house not do all the silly side things."

        "The only problem I have with this game is that, if you have brought everything out of each of your stores and still have coins available WHY CAN'T WE USE OUR LEFT OVER COINS AND BUYS SPOONS? Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

        "It's a fun twist on the match-3 concept and a nice shift from the original Farm Heroes.  I wish you could earn gold bars instead of only being able to buy them.  Why not through the Country Show?  I'd rather earn gold bars than the unusable and irrelevant  coins and trophies.",

        "Not a bad game but it's typical like some other games. It starts off with the levels being super easy, letting you build your confidence to get you thinking you're really good.  Now I understand the higher the levels the more difficulty there is but not to the point where they make it almost impossible trying to get you to buy more chances. Another words they're trying to get you to pay to win and advance not necessarily on skill level. Very sneaky. Uninstalling. It's fun for a while but overall I do not recommend.",
        "Love this game, but it freezes up. I go to try and reinstall it after a few days but it won't let me reinstall the game. Just stays at the same  level last completed. Still having the problem of when having to reinstall I lose all my lives and charms. Love the game but hate ,owing all my lives and charms",
        "I love this game but damn, why does the videos seem to always freeze up. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good game and all, so why don't you guys just fix the glitches. Thank you🤔",
        "The update took me from level 400 back to level 1 very upset be first I wasn't getting my daily play rewards so I figured like everything else it may need to update and the update blow my whole progress. I'm so pissed is there a way to fix this?",
        "I actually enjoyed the game and would give it four or five stars except 200 coins and multiple items were taking away simply because I got logged out if Facebook. Also several levels were lost.... This I understand, glitches happen. What I don't understand and don't accept is the lack of response from the developer. I've sent several emails and have yet to get a non automated response.",
        "I installed the game about 3 times and gave up. Can't connect with Facebook and when playing it suddenly stop and say it's not responding."

        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "Updates keep getting stuck with the ver 3.8.1. Since it was released. Download 269 out of 269 but nothing happens after that, and a message of \"connection error\" keeps appearing. Have passed the daily log in bonus, and will probably lose the consecutive login bonuses as a result. Didn't create transfer code or link to fb account yet so may risk of losing account if I reinstall. Please fix this asap.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star"

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",

I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",

I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "New Review because of update: ° I really love this game. I'm hooked. Relaxing yet stimulating. Some levels are easy as cutting through soft butter with lots of delightful bombs and others take several tries to master and need that one devise a strategy and some others are much up to luck. I love that variation: relaxing and stimulating and sometimes a bit frustrating. ° I had finished all the levels of version 2 and then waited for an update which came with new levels and I finished them also about 4 weeks ago. I've opened the game every day since to see if yet an other update came, and yes, yesterday it did and have already finished all levels (that says more about my fanaticism than it says about the difficulty of the game). ° I appreciate the tournament (I topped the monthly yesterday but had dropped 3 steps while I was sleeping and have clawed my way back to the top this evening, but I guess I'll be back down tomorrow. But it's fun! And I got generous daily prizes. ° And I love the new version that even though I again have finished all levels, I can just go on playing thanks to the Level Tower (even if it at 46 repeated a previous level). ° Lovely graphics, good game sound.",

I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "Supposed random game is not random. You only win the lowest prices until you start spending gold.  Black market is the same. Also it will take you a decade before you get the best robots unless you shell out your hard earned money. I hope the drop off scheme would earn me points, however it's just for one type of robot.",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard"

        "Had friends refer me to the  games. At 1st I wasn't  happy I couldn't  just  select  the games I wanted to play I had to earn the level it was on to open them. It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm",
        "Have so much fun playing this. It's nice to be able to have a \"flutter\" and not use real money. Good fun, great graphics and so many different slots to choose from, plus the rewards are well worth it. Thank you hof! Awesome!! Love this game! Though only one thing to gripe about, the adds are becoming more invasive. Despite this I thoroughly enjoy myself! So keep it up!"

        "This has a lot of potential. Connection issues are horrendous after this last update. Also, add a help section that explains what everything means. Lots of stats, numbers, ratings, etc. that we have to figure out on our own. Another thing, stopped receiving notifications after updating to Oreo.",
        "Overall it's pretty fun and addicting.  My only real issue came up with today's update. My 40-rated team got matched to play against a 60-rated team in my first Challenge game. wut",
        "The game was great until the update. Took my team from a 43 to a 41. Put alot of time into it, hope this gets worked out. They also nerfed training. Don't even bother wasting 15 coins on an extra session.",
        "Update: ***500 coins for ~350k in game cash isnt even 1 rookie signing.... you can get 3 star players for that kind of coin. **** the latest updates have added cool new features like the coach analysis, fewer bugs and more consistency. The coach analysis function could be cool but every description is \"this player is making great progress, keep pushing him!\" Even for aging players who are getting worse as the seasons progress. It does however project where the player could trend stats wise.  Still no goalie stats. Still no trade options (not sure how that would wotk) but they added refunds to contracts you release from your roster which depend on the player and their contract value,  time remaining etc...  Would be cool to also be able to make in game adjustments, like if your star goalie is letting goal after goal slip through swapping goal tenders would be nice otherwise there doesn't really seem to be a point in having 2 goalies even on the roster.  Overall it's a Fun game with a LOT of potential, if you're a fan of hockey you should definitely give this a try. Would like to see some of these things as the game develops",
        "Please fix how it automatically signs a new player if you don't renew a contract.. the purpose is to dump cap space and it signs some random player and then won't let me release him.  Also STOP changing my line ups. At any point any time ever. There's no need to change it or else you night as well play the game for me. I spend alot of time re doing them and then next thing I know every thing is changed. Not sure why or what causes it buy it is annoying as hell",
        "Overall it is a decent game. However finding an opponent for the games especially the rank games sucks. Either you get another player who is far superior to you or another who is far below your level. It needs to be more equal to be fun."

Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",

        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "Decent game, lots of fun to keep you coming back. I would of rated a 4 star game but every time I need to watch a video the game stops working, stopping me from getting a free premium egg or opening chests!"

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

        "I have really enjoyed this game from the first week it dropped. Never spent a penny. Most things I can compete in. What players say about pay2play is true though.  If you want to play at the highest level you HAVE TO PAY! There is a very clear pay wall and everyone knows it. If your starting off and your free to play it will take you awhile and I don't even think it will be work it unless you plan to put at least 6 month in to be somewhat relevant.",
        "Stop doing these tutorials that force you to select their options, if I need a tutorial I'll use the tutorial, if I want to just play the game and figure it out along the way let me do that.   I'm so sick of these games that don't give you any option. Is there anyone that likes tutorials that are done like this?",
        "Pros: • Semi-Balanced pvp. • Tons of characters. • Fun leveling system. • Entertaining in-game events  • Challenging story mode. • No need to pay to become very strong.  • Auto-battles that save time.   Cons: • Constant Pop-ups reminding you to purchase loot boxes. • You will get wrecked by serious pay-to-wins. • Impossible drop rates for 5☆ characters and Chaos/Order heros. • Paying to unlock 5☆ heros that may or may not be 5☆. • The company spamming copy pasted messages to players who have beef with thier game instead of constructive replies.  Overall: Still a pretty cool game.",
        "A game with buckets of potential, led astray by poor decisions & short term constant cash grabs(multiple times a week)  Poor balancing - stat accensions, Crown dust upgrade costs ( when even  avip 10+ lvl60 developer acc hadn't upgraded any crowns..I've checked dozens of high vip lvl 60s 0 upgraded crowns) 6* artis are pointless & don't feel worth owning.  Constant pop ups, easily 40-50 store pop ups per day sometimes multiple times within a minute.  the Lucky 7 quest was criminal, horrendous design & I won't be spending a penny with you guys again until I see you go down a better path.   the positives, autoing but being able to leave the game. Festival/ hero events are pretty damn good although it be nice to see different style events that 'have gameplay'  Characters are well designed & are extremely fun to use.   To summarise, has some excellent features but it's let down by some horrendous balancing & constant cash grabs that would get EA taking notes.",

        "Like so many other games like this out there it is\"pay to win\". This is nearly every \"free\" mobile game it there now. So why the 5 stars? A few reasons. A big one being that they do make the super currency accessible without paying via offers. Many of which rewards higher amount than what someone would come to expect just for making it a fair ways into other games.  Second is that the levelling system is fair and no content is truly locked for those who don't pay. It will just take you a little longer to get what you want if you don't but it won't be excluding you from the best content.   As for the game itself is alright. You collect heroes and you can engage in a variety of activities. From a campaign mode and it's associated elite version to random dungeons to guild wars, pvp, and a gauntlet. Overall you can kill however much time you want on this game. Once you start attaining higher levels you will find it easier to spend more and more time on content.  Finally as always I strongly recommend doing a Google search too learn best strategies.",

        "Really enjoy the game. Only problem is,it will not let me in the Dungeon. Can you fix this for me? 5 stars without that problem.",
        "It was really cool. I got interested playing it. I was only on for 20 mins and already on level 10",

World chat is more like a dating site and is not child friendly. The admins do nothing to stop the behaviour in world chat. I strongly advise you not to allow your kids anywhere near this game",

Everyone playing is here to get credits in another game .  Which is why this game has so many downloads  not because it's actually good. The over-sexualized comments in the chat rooms are ridiculous. Parents if you are reading this I would not allow my child to play this game unless you are going to sit with them every moment. If you have to do that is it even really worth allowing your child to play the game.",

If you want something thats fun and never ever going to try to take your money, play clash. 5 years of playing it and ive only bought a 5$ thing bc gems just come so easily and im a lvl170 th10 . No need to spend money to get good",

I mean this is just insulting to clash of clans and how hard they worked to make clash of clans... lazy! I just downloaded the game to rate it... enjoy my one star review lazy jerks... rate this a one star and download clash of clans.",

They encourage you to register the game with an email account but give you the run around should you seek to change it. The game is not worth the time nor money."

        "Like ot a lot. Taskforces need to be improved drasticly. Focus on playing with others makes it a lot more fun. EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "The best casino App I have played yet. You get to choose avatar and  have them choose which casino on the famous Last Vegas strip. Well you earn more casinos as you level up. And the balloon pop is fun too! And I won alot of money on the community bonus round. Where the people playing next  to you win during the bonus!",
        "Was good at first but, at a certain point the game is rigged worse than real slots in Vegas. Good rewards and all but, issue I have is I play a certain slot game longer than people who join later and they win large amounts immediately whereas about 90% of the time I lose chips more than win....I even switch up my bets and have bought chips thinking this would get the game to allow wins and nothing. Wanted to get enough V coins for Cirque but rather just pay full price at this point.",
        "I'm 6 levels shy of level 2000 and I just wanted to know if the daily reward and the hourly rewards will ever go up??? That'll be a great opportunity for players who reach a certain level in the game to collect a higher amount of money!!!   Also, how about EVERY weekend you'll do a DOUBLE YOUR MONEY when buying money!!!  That why you'll be making more money and customers can and will be very satisfied ever weekend...   P.S. THANKS FOR THE AWESOME GAME 👍👍👍👍👍",
        "It's cool, but one of the gimmicks is that you can play with other players, the problem is there is absolutely no way to play with your friends, you can only see the progress / help / be helped by complete strangers. Even if you invite a friend through fb... nothing. Not worth downloading until they update it.",
        "21 million in coin, the new game popup hi low comes on. I play, I go back to my game all coins gone. The Emerald 7 kept playing while i was gone evidently. But how does 21 million disappear with a bet of 300k in less than 5 minutes. This is second time I have tried this game. It just wants you to buy coin, jokers.",
        "If you have any problems with your chips, dont expect them to help in any way. I was losing chips after bonus game on cleopatra. They pretty much said its my fault."

        "Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Good game but......after a day into it you make no coin. After every level upgrade it pushes the (buy) equipment option. Not to mention every time you level up. You got to.exit out 15 boxes.before you can continue. Good game but, it's a failure on the free to play aspect.  My rating is fair and final. It's a (ok)  game but many better ones out thwre",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",
        "Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s"

        "This is a fairly clever game, my son (5)and me enjoy the strategy.  Once you learn the importance of each character it becomes even better. The main negative is it's completely fixed to try and lure you to purchase better cards and upgrades. You can win 8 games in a row then you lose them, it's about that number every time, coincendence? I think not. it's very hard to even get to castle 6 and we've been trying for about a month.",
        "Your game server is from the stone age.  Too slow. Ruins the entire game.  You charge money for this game.  At least fix the server. Also opponents get gems faster at times.  Prob server issue also.  Editors choice?  They must of played it for 30 min.  Played for a few months. Fed up with frustration.",
        "1.The player with the highest data speed wins the war. 2.I wish  mana can be looted from opponents. 3.I wish there is a clan war. 4.Some epic cards are too expensive that they can never be owned by poor players.  Just a point of view.",
        "Hey developers I need and improvement. Make another section in the shop where we can see 30sec of video adds to get a reward of 1️⃣ GEM or 💯 COINS. So, what do you say?",
        "Great game except for the. Incredible imbalance in pvp gameplay. Can pretty much tell who will win or lose as soon as u see the players specs. Getting bored of this quickly.",

        "It's a nice game, with a great graphics and such but the auto-update for extra files it's kind of annoying. Is there anyway to turn it off? Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

        "Like so many other games like this out there it is\"pay to win\". This is nearly every \"free\" mobile game it there now. So why the 5 stars? A few reasons. A big one being that they do make the super currency accessible without paying via offers. Many of which rewards higher amount than what someone would come to expect just for making it a fair ways into other games.  Second is that the levelling system is fair and no content is truly locked for those who don't pay. It will just take you a little longer to get what you want if you don't but it won't be excluding you from the best content.   As for the game itself is alright. You collect heroes and you can engage in a variety of activities. From a campaign mode and it's associated elite version to random dungeons to guild wars, pvp, and a gauntlet. Overall you can kill however much time you want on this game. Once you start attaining higher levels you will find it easier to spend more and more time on content.  Finally as always I strongly recommend doing a Google search too learn best strategies.",

One last thing, the co-op mode has some bug where u created the room but unable to start the game even when u have enough player. Please fix that, thank you.",

        "The game is really addictive. Hours of game play and activities. I really like it. However, since it's international the time for coop game should be more flexible so i can join with my friends at suitable time. Tournament matching is a little bit unbalanced, either it's a raid or it's a total defeat. And heroes skills should  give more details on stats, so we can plan effectively. Thank you for such a good game.",
        "They are about to make it more of a money trap with an update that screws f2p and budgeted p2w. They say they have free events and events so part time p2w have fun. Then why are people talking about quitting? These are high paying players. I know you plan on making it so hero's bought for special skills like stun and silence won't work if there's a big gap. You've made it so hero's bought for the purpose of moving these budgeted p2w are useless. So it's in favor of real p2w. It should be a reverse. Make the lower people have a better chance not a worse one.",

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

        "For a free game? I can't complain too much especially if i don't pay for it. The containers are actually a good addition to this game since you get containers for free. If you're lucky enough you can win a premium tank and those things are not cheap! But wargaming actually give them away for free. The event is impossible to finish if you don't pay with gold and to win a tank you must pay a huge amount of $$$. But for casual and f2p players? I think you'll enjoy it. It's a game guys, play for fun!",
        "The game is good compared to the game i often play online. I could have rated this game all five stars. The controls for driving must have other options to choose from. And its not suitable for android phones that has 5 inches sreen display. My thumb keeps slipping off whenever i try to maneauver the  vehicle. On Pc's much more easier to handle using a keyboard and a mouse.",
        "Hello. I love WOT and trying to play together witg my son. But we've chosen different servers (Europe & Russia) and now i cant find him in the players list to be able to join one platoon. I also cant connect to his server and he cant connect to mine cause system doesnt allow it. can you please suggest how we can join one platoon in this case? Thank you.",
        "Best mobile game I've played, more fun than the PC world of tanks for sure. Only real complaint is that it takes up a lot of space on my phone... It's worth the investment in memory though. Make sure you're in a good wifi spot and have a portable battery and happy tanking",
        "Not a bad game.  I'm a little sick of the unrealistic tanks.  Also the unrealistic play in some ways.  I wish there was a mode that limited you to real tanks of the same time period and had more realistic damage based on the weapons.  For example, I don't want to see the Dracula tank and the 88mm on my Tiger should blow a Sherman away in 1 shot at point blink range, not 6 shots...",
        "Why is 6 of my team on one area while I am in the other. Because of this spawning system I died literally 5 seconds after the battle started. Great game though. Why is there so much lag. And why are my controls frozen. I move forward a  little and then I move 50 feet away from my spot. Fix this and then you get a big fat 5 stars."

This has happened to me several times already and I'm passing thus information on. Please, King Games, investigate this immediately because I enjoy your games and would like to see this resolved. Thank you.",
        "Update: HELP! now I can't do anything whatsoever with other people! I can't ask for lives or send them! It's getting frustrating when I can't even use the lives I've already been given! Why can't I send lives anymore?!  Thank you! For updating the game! I almost uninstalled this game cuz it was taking so long. Hello! Out of levels! Hurry up please! I enjoy the game, but I'm all caught up. I've been trying to up my scores just to have a reason to keep the game on my phone. So far so good. I just started today and I'm enjoying it! Thank you! More recently, I love it! I've been trying to find a game with the quality of King games in this category and no one is a good! Thank you!",
        "Love this game! It's challenging, addictive and beautifully developed both visually and audibly.My complaints would be:   *Certain aspects of the game are not clear, with nowhere to reference. So certain occurrences just seem incidental and therefore don't allow you to fully strategize.   *There are no written rules or explanations to refer to. Additionslly, the game is not customizable. I was just assigned a random avatar (which I don't like) which doesn't appear adjustable.  *It also used my real name to identify in the game, even though I had already created one before registering to King Games. Worse, there seems to be no way to change this either.  If there is a way already developed to address these issues, please help!",
        "I would've rated everything MUCH higher before I did the update. Now I can't play anymore. The words are too faint to see, and the game won't load properly. I LOVE this game, and REALLY want the bugs fixed so that I don't have to quit playing.",
        "The last update was terrible, scores and progress so faint it cant be read, please do something about it, updated again today and it's worse than before can't play the game at all now, going to get rid of it",
        "Very engaging & easy to learn. Bright explosive graphics that are smoothly animated. Great for all ages. Just the right amount of a challenge with levels increasing in difficulty. Practice makes perfect.  Some levels are easy but some are fairly difficult."

But, Game stuck at 11% before updating & also after updating & it's become HABIT for me to see the Gameloft's March of empires: war of lord games SERVER PROBLEM. I am a Android mobile user, so, there must be a option of graphic quality change just to make sure that game runs smoothly, because I spend many months to grow & if big guys using PC version attacks, then I can't do anything because my game just freezes, lags & don't respond for some time. But the game is over for me as I loss so much. So, Gameloft launch a LITE VERSION FOR ANDROID USERS or there are huge chances of players who will leavethis game & already many left this game, as you can see the are many dead castles in each realm.",
        "Please upgrade to more realistic graphics and gameplay like Age of empires 3. Think more innovative like Fort camps to protect capitals and much more is needed in regard to spies, make it more difficult to spy and gather info. Also the defenses should be given more importance cause some guys from all realms have huge armies and it's easy for them to break into castles, I prefer more options when it comes to defenses. You guys are doing great but more options the better."

I emailed support and they told me what server my character should be on and she's still not there! It keeps prompting me to make a new character.",

Other people in game said they had the same problem and said to fix it, you needed to uninstall it and redownload. Which I did. But now my characters are gone and I have to start off fresh. I've spent money in the game on  building up two characters. And I'm pissed now that it appears its money totally wasted. I feel that this is basically stealing!!",

It keeps restarting and resetting to 0%",

I truly can give this 5 stars cause I played it for weeks and have come across the different scenarios in the game. Thank you for your awesome customer service and great game!!!!",
        "Great. But some of the bonus games for golf bucks are not winnable.  For example, long drive gets a longer required result each time you beat it.  I'm currently required to beat 415 yards which I am sure is impossible.  So why bother trying?",
        "Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.",
        "I have played and enjoyed this game just about every day for a year or more now.  For some reason and somehow, they've sucked the fun out of the game.  It used to be about playing and earning \"golf bucks\" to use for things like re- filling your golf bag with irons, etc.  However now, it's very difficult to \"earn\" those golf bucks, in fact, it's even harder to play the game.  Now you can go through a complete hole without having any cards that you can actually play.  Now it seems that all the game is about is paying for irons, etc., and/or watching advertising videos to obtain clubs.  Like I said, I really used to enjoy this game but now?  I think it's time to uninstall it and move on to something that is actually fun, not frustrating.  I'd rate this game as \"0\" now, if it were possible!!!",
        "It's a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it's way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we've all waited way too long it's time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????",
        "People will tell you that it's good for your brain or that it's fun, but that really isn't true, especially since it won't even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can't even think for yourself and try it alone. It's annoying. Don't get it. Go to a different solitary game."

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "It would be better if they offered more free chips. Rather than bombarding us Every time we log in with there outrageous prices. Also a flush draw Every other hand and usually someone hits. Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done."

        "I am only giving ABF a 3 right now. I have played ABF since the beginning of it's time. I feel as if the coin rewards are very slim in the higher leagues. I am a Diamond Star 4 and I feel as if the higher the level the higher the reward but, the rewards are all the same. When you work your way up you want to feel rewarded! If coin rewards increase in the higher levels so will my rating!!!!!",
        "I would give it 5 stars, but they've changed a few things. It's now more difficult to earn coins for power-ups. So in order to win the tournaments, they've put people in the position of having to make purchases more often. Needless to say, I don't play as often anymore. I've also noticed that several of my friends don't play anymore either. Too bad, the game used to be a lot more fun.",
        "Been playing this game for years. Loved it in the beginning.  Seems the lower I rate the game as they try to make easier for people that are not good.  the birds I throw are nearly useless a lot of times compared to playing the same game for a star 2 player I know. And now the game is crashing constantly. Wish I could sell the nearly 100,000 bird coins I have. Seems I won't need them.",
        "Ok so when there is an issue that needs addressed, sometimes it take a couple of days for the tech people to get to it. But overall the game is awesome! This is the only game that I still play every day from the time I got a smart phone, which has been several years!",
        "I love playing angry birds friends. I'm an adult woman and have played since they came out with the game. Scoring in first place many times. Recently there seems to be too much graphics and sometimes using plays from other games or other angry birds games. If people are submitting what they have thought out, please make sure it stays within original angry birds friends game. Some levels are too far out there.",
        "I loved this game to keep in touch with a few friends but please take those stupid Dignity ads off... They do not close and always end up missing up my game. I have to close the game out and start all over. Loosing many power ups and coins in this tedius game making it more frustrating than fun."

It can be the best fun ever. But it exponentially grows so you'll never hit the top without continual spending .  Miss all the wonderful peeps but refuse to be a whale or a cash cow .",

You can only get so far, then you a required to spend actual cash to continue playing. If you want to max out your base you better have DEEP pockets. This is not a joke, if you want to be a serious player, it will cost you around $300 a week just to keep up. Only the rich get anywhere in this game.",

One cyber Titan can zero anything that has highest normal T52 troops and best bio titans...... without sending a commander Once u reach building level 1100 offered for less than 19.99 USDyou will have no access to packs less than $100 USD and no access to RSS for older troops",
        "I use to have one of the strongest bases in MKST.. Mistress Vixen..nickname Vix.  Anyhow i have spent easily around $3,000 us dollar on this game. And one day my shield lapsed and I got zeroed after about 40 plus hits. I quit playing. I started back and spent  littke money cause I missed my alliance people I started to consider family after almost a year of play.  Anyhow now they came out with cybernetics and the packs for that are $99.00 everytime. I'm sorry this has went to far. This is a pay to play game 100%.",
        "Lots to do to increase your power, tons of new buildings giving massive power boosts, just wait a little bit & you may get lucky with a $99 pack being reduced to $19. Make sure you have plenty of money for this game. If you don't have the money, then starting out new, you'll be at a stand still around HQ level 20 & commander level 50, with only increasing power by researching, training more troops, & building traps for your wall. This game has been slowing down a lot lately though, not sure if it's the game or my phone causing it.",

Their lvl and power are bigger than mine, so I spend more money an that still don't help for the event this game is starting to suck. My res base I have never spent no then on it and I have it Hq lvl 350 what is up with that. Helping a base who has not spent no money. Help the people who has spent money"

        "I love all the Is-it Love stories, they're fun and a great distraction. My only complaint is that there isn't enough free daily energy! You only get a teensy bit of the story every day, which is maddening. There should be loads more ways to earn energy, especially like the mini games.",
        "Matt seems like kind of an asshat in Season 2. She should just dump him. Could do way better. Like with Daryl perhaps? He obviously cares for her wayyy more than Matt does. Matt only has eyes for Lana. Like he says he loves our girl? I don't think so. I wish you could choose somebody else to date.",
        "Energy is too short & there isn't anything other than a side game for 100 more points to keep you entertained. The app is basically a story with a couple of nice artistic pictures.  Way over priced. You can buy a book for less at Barnes and Nobles and still get twice the amount in content. The the amount of money they ask for engery in this game is ridiculous. Don't be silly  and spend money that you can do better with. Just play for free or not at all.",
        "I think it's a good game but... Let's be fair you don't get to play for long each day before you run out of energy and have to wait 24 hours and even then it's only a few minutes play.... The lack of play time makes me loose all interest in what I believe might be a decent game",
        "So. This is an addictive store. The main characters are very well thought out. A few Grammer error and hick ups in game play. Although this game can be expensive if you don't make the right choice. I had bought the same secret scene twice and it still asks me to buy it. This is the second time this has happened. All in all great game.",
        "I find it aggravating that your energy goes down so fast. You get a few seconds of free play per day. I've paid to get more. But I can't and won't keep doing that when even paying for extra doesn't last long. 😒"

Aces, review by Da1 G Reaper of the Sun Tzu Ghosts Gaming Community... #livfreeplyhard #STGGC",
        "Good luck in this game if ya don't want to spend money. No game balancing meaning a lvl12 can attk lvl  1 with no post attk shield or protection of any kind. Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",
        "Hi A.K server 52. Have been playing for couple of months now and still love the game.just when you think you are on top of things something new comes up. I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

        "Sometimes I would give it a five star other times 4 star. Good number of challenge keys per visit to none challenge sites. As few as two visits needed for one visit to challenge site in final level of challenge (requiring 25keys). Love the two modes for cards of fate. No time limit but fewer tries works great if you write down what you find. It surprisingly has improved my timed play of this mini game. There are getting to be too many items and NO search functions to facilitate where to find a particular item, what collection items belong to if someone wants it and you don't want to send it anonymously (case if you send a requested item) and don't send it from the gift bar. One of the better hide and find games.",
        "I changed my previous rating. There are so many glitches, especially with new events  and support doesn't respond to requests. I haven't gotten totem bonuses for three days and new event is nearly impossible at times to find bunnies and objects. This used to be my \"go to\" stress reliever but now it just creates more stress.",
        "Instead of relaxing me this game stresses the hell out of me. New bunny location is extremely hard to find the 🐇. And the time limit is too short. I know im wasting my time writing this cause I've seen a lot people complaining about it and nothing is been done. Will be unistalling if it doesn't gets fix. Good day",
        "The main complaint is that some tasks have insanely short timers, like for the new event where you have to find optionnal stuff that's really well hidden as well as the usual pack of items that usually takes the whole timer to find. Great game, bases itself too much on money dropping.",
        "The only thing I don't like about the game is that by the time you search a couple of places (depending on ur level) is how long you have to wait to get enough energy up to search again. Depending on what you want to search it can take up to an hour or more to get the requirements. Other than that I really like the game."

        "I'm not a fan of mobile gaming, but this game is truly something else. I love The Walking Dead, so I gave this a shot, however, after playing Road to Survival (or whatever it's called- it's the TWD game based off of the comics), my expectations were pretty low. This game though, is not Road to Survival; it's so much more. This is how you do a free to play game with microtransactions right. You can buy a lot in this game with money, but you can easily obtain everything on your own, and quite frankly, it's more fun to do that anyways. This game is super addicting and gives me something fun to do when I've got a few minutes. I've been playing it for months, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.",
        "Just a suggestion, it'll be SO MUCH MORE AWESOME probably 10 stars for TWD fans if you could do better missions or events that allow us to get better opportunities to farm for TWD character tokens or class tokens, and also more chance for farming or creating weapons instead of the current set up now. Don't quite like the fact that when deals are awesome but they cost a ton! Try lessen the value a little bit and im sure some players dont mind spending (just my opinion). But overall review, its awesome for TWD fans out there!",
        "It's got good action in graphic. Been playing for a 2 years in 10 month's now.Stay human and Survive.  Up dates all the time love it keep them coming Robert Cregman. Thanks for making the Walking  dead show And game. New stuff to do all the time. In wow all these new survivers. There are some loading issues action issues movement issues alot more mission.",
        "Originally gave you 4 stars, but its one of only a couple of mobile games I have never deleted since installing. Constant content coming in, great use of TWD licence! Keep up the great work- seriously from someone who hates most mobile games!",
        "I've been playing for over 2 years. A few more new maps would be nice and stop nerfing our great traits like interrupt and wrestler! Other than that, great game and great community.",
        "Really good strategy game. The thing that lost it the 5th star is that when I started a second game on another device, it won't play ads for free stuff"

        "I think this game has very good everything, the only thing about the game play is that they trick you kind of and it is hard to get Easter Eggs and stuff. Or when you jump off a train and there is one of those things you have to roll under but you have no time so the police catches you. Or maybe I am not good with those things. Yeah, probably just I am not good at this game.",
        "Why is it difficult to get daily challenge without using data?  And one can't see other users scores without data. Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

        "This game is BRILLIANT! But quite difficult. Sometimes I try and slide but instead I roll????? Maybe if the controls were less sensitive???? Also, jackpot I never ever get. I really want the teleporter but I can't get enough coins and I've been playing for AGES! Otherwise, brilliant game always fun. Time consuming.Thank you!"

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Please give us the option to disable Auto Target Tracking in settings.  The auto tracking can cause you to fire at ships your not wanting to target, especially if there lined up side by side. And cause your shots to fall way short or too far if the enemy ship is coming straight towards you. If love to have the ability to disable this feature in the settings."

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

        "Nice game but the random number generator is non existent. Hold three numbers and roll again, even with free or earned additional rolls, are ALWAYS the same number that was there! This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",
        "Love the game! But recently did an update for the app now my game glitches out. Takes forever to roll the dice. Only updated the app cuz it said they fixed bugs & made faster well it did the opposite for my app.",
        "Showdown is a joke!  100% guarantee opponent will get a double Yahtzee every single game.  Their average score is 320+ when a normal person scores 250-275.  Impossible enough to score a Yahtzee yourself but double is almost unheard of.",
        "Playing verse your friends is fun but Playing against the computer is not fun but a complete waste of time. Only way to Win is to Extra rolls with the Dice you have to buy. If you don't plan on losing 2/3 of the time.",
        "The game was awesome until the ads started to pop up every 5 seconds, and the game progressively got slower and slower. Now it's just ads upon ads and lag. Game got ruined quick."

        "I have really enjoyed this game from the first week it dropped. Never spent a penny. Most things I can compete in. What players say about pay2play is true though.  If you want to play at the highest level you HAVE TO PAY! There is a very clear pay wall and everyone knows it. If your starting off and your free to play it will take you awhile and I don't even think it will be work it unless you plan to put at least 6 month in to be somewhat relevant.",
        "Stop doing these tutorials that force you to select their options, if I need a tutorial I'll use the tutorial, if I want to just play the game and figure it out along the way let me do that.   I'm so sick of these games that don't give you any option. Is there anyone that likes tutorials that are done like this?",
        "Pros: • Semi-Balanced pvp. • Tons of characters. • Fun leveling system. • Entertaining in-game events  • Challenging story mode. • No need to pay to become very strong.  • Auto-battles that save time.   Cons: • Constant Pop-ups reminding you to purchase loot boxes. • You will get wrecked by serious pay-to-wins. • Impossible drop rates for 5☆ characters and Chaos/Order heros. • Paying to unlock 5☆ heros that may or may not be 5☆. • The company spamming copy pasted messages to players who have beef with thier game instead of constructive replies.  Overall: Still a pretty cool game.",
        "A game with buckets of potential, led astray by poor decisions & short term constant cash grabs(multiple times a week)  Poor balancing - stat accensions, Crown dust upgrade costs ( when even  avip 10+ lvl60 developer acc hadn't upgraded any crowns..I've checked dozens of high vip lvl 60s 0 upgraded crowns) 6* artis are pointless & don't feel worth owning.  Constant pop ups, easily 40-50 store pop ups per day sometimes multiple times within a minute.  the Lucky 7 quest was criminal, horrendous design & I won't be spending a penny with you guys again until I see you go down a better path.   the positives, autoing but being able to leave the game. Festival/ hero events are pretty damn good although it be nice to see different style events that 'have gameplay'  Characters are well designed & are extremely fun to use.   To summarise, has some excellent features but it's let down by some horrendous balancing & constant cash grabs that would get EA taking notes.",

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

You'll be in s timed level and you lose time because you can't see under the words.  Some levels its ridiculous to have to do them 15 times to pass it",
        "I think there is difference between hard to solve or impossible. To get diamonds in order you should be able to get them. As example. Need to get circle first then triangle. But you cant get triangle unless circle is moved first. And mission failed because you didnt get diamonds in order. This is repeats over and over again. This is impossible to solve. I even had to deal with triangle being right down at the bottom. And all other diamonds at the top. I failed of cause. I am giving my view because I fed up with this stupid idea.",
        "I really love this game. But expeditions are more fun then the game itself. I really wish we could actually finish the expeditions instead , of not getting to finish the story behind them. Also during the expeditions to buy things are way to expensive because the amount of maic it takes to remove one item. Pls address these issuea. Really hope to see some expeditions we can really have fun and finish with.",
        "I love the expedition part but not enough time to complete them. Also i cut one tree down and have to wait an hour to cut another. Its takes to much magic to clear paths.Its hard to build the bridges and stuff because of this. Other then that i have no problem with it.",
        "Love the different puzzle styles that go along with the basic mahjong matching game. It gives an extra challenge to completing each game. Sadly I have only gotten to 250 levels after a year or 2 of playing because the puzzles are constantly rigged to lose. I am not a cash player as I have more important living expenses to spend money on so buying power ups and such are not an option for me. Would be great if there weren't so many losing games one after the other. I'm referring to the ones where you get to the last couple of tiles and the gems needed are at the very bottom so you are made to match the 4th set of gems when you are supposed to match the 3rd set first. I get multiple games where the matching tiles are stacked on top of each other so it requires a shuffle to win. As I said I am not and refuse to cash shop on a game that is not worth spending money as it is not a necessity so it would be nice to be able to progress without 10-15 losing games in a row. The spinning wheel doesn't always have ads available and I rarely get power ups from it. I mainly get paws.",
        "Game updated now havent a clue what i need on level 421 and objects i need are blank boxes can play game but dont know what i need if any one can tell me object amount and what levels they are on it would be a help. Also have uninstalled game a installed it again but still dosnt help."

        "Top tier player here, I've been enjoying the game greatly for the most part. My biggest issue would be that energy takes years to recharge. If it was shortened to one or two minutes to Regen one energy then that would be amazing. Another issue I have is that I think all players should receive one SSR when they complete the tutorial. I have a whole team of them, but others aren't so fortunate. Thanks for your time, if one or both of these are changed I will rate this 5 stars!",
        "In short, games got amazing potential. Amazing manga-like visuals? First I've seen for an app. However, they NEED to make the d*$&m game more F2P so the player base is more welcoming, how TF is it you can ONLY get Pandora at VIP 8?!..   Also, many-many other great games do offer lifetime gem login purchases.   Just saying. ;)",
        "Nice. They added new characters. I'm waiting for Namida, Brandi and Sora's SSR forms, hope they come soon. There's one problem I'm having with the recent update though. I can't play Soul Towers Battle in Special Trials because my phone keeps crashing. The gameplay in other areas are running smooth, only the Soul Towers Battle causes my phone to crash. Fix it please...",
        "I really loved the gameplay and the characters, but then all of my dadta got lost and i had to start from the begining. I made it so far within the story and leveld up my characters so much. Grinded for a few hours to get the materials and money i needed. It was all for nothing. Fix this bug pls. Hope this doesnt happen to your account",
        "Not so much a review, but I can't figure out how to unlock the last two outfits.(Gal.cat and the blue yakata). Any help much appreciated. Cannot find guides anywhere. Is this game p2w? Somewhat but you can unlock everything without paying.",
        "It's just a pay to win game. I'm very disappointed for the energy bar... I need 13 hours and 36 minutes to recharge to full at this point. Difficult to upgrade characters and their skills and everything you want to do you must pay. As a game (idea) awesome but unplayable if you can't afford it"

        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance"

AND THEN WHEN THE NEW UPDATE COMES OUT.... I LOSE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you PLEASE give me the stuff back.",
        "This is my favorite game.I have played it since I was in P1 but the only things that I want Rilisoft to make are a 4th campaign world cause I have been waiting for almost 4 years and that you can give your friends weapons.But still great and memorable game so well done Rilisoft",
        "I like this game a lot. I don't know if I were think too much but I feel like Everytime I level up, the weapon that I use before was unexpectedly weaker.Lucky chest seem to drop only coins and crysrals(sometimes I got free spin). And some modes, weapons and armor balance is not really that balance (example:last match I used smart bullet bazooka to kill people using 4 rockets to kill them. But he killed me with only 2 rockets of smart bullet bazooka...... How is that even balance?!). I hope you fix this soon. Because I love to play game.",
        "This game is really good its just lots of items are so expensive can u lower that  besides that this app is so cute and kaoss at the same time love it keep up the good work😜🙌🙋🙌😋😝",
        "I love the new update thank you cubic games for adding back the double jump with the berserk boots you guys are awesome. I also love the new controls it feels much more comfortable for me so I really love that.  the new controls are very nice and it makes it a lot easier to play",
        "It's fun but it logs me out every once and a while in a game then I lose trophies but I like, also its hard to earn money"

        "Played this game for about 2 years.  Used to be great until the terrible ucool made it completely pay to win.  They have unbalanced and just add new heroes for $100 a month, ridiculous.  Terrible company that only cares about money, for your sake, find a different game.",

        "Gameplay is fun and easy to grasp. Only things needed is a minor improvement in graphics and a way to acquire more stamina. Always run out of stamina and end up having to play something else while I wait for stamina to recharge.",
        "Pay to win, fun game until middle stages where it one shots your group unless you pay money to get over powered characters. I can't even progress anymore because the boss one shots me every time.",
        "I have been playing this game for a long time now...going on 3 years. It is still an awesome game. For all the people saying it's P2W you are wrong....flat out wrong. Do not blame the devs for your impatience or inability to see the strategy in the game. This game can be completely F2P if you have patience. I do no blame the devs for wanting to get paid for releasing a quality product. Paying for the little boosts here and there give you an edge but give it a month and then the new characters are available through several different means. Keep up the good work!!!"

        "A well made app that's immersive, addictive, and the essence of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. The app is mission based and has a complex but easy to use medal system with rock-paper-scissors type of combat. You can join/make a party, or go solo. Money isn't an issue so long as you pace yourself. It gets better the more you play. There are optional event quests and a story, but don't fret if you can't get the app or just starting out; it's slow going. 735 quests.",
        "Liking the cute art style but my god does this game take forever to download even with a low resolution. Has taken me two attempts and I'm doubtful that it's related to my broadband speed and connection (not sure if it's to do with my phone? But again, doubtful.) Would be great if this could be fixed somehow.",
        "I freaking love this game! However I have a small complaint that is probably fixable. I was wondering for my lg g6 if you could expand the borders so the screen would fit. And if the screen is not able to get any bigger, I'm hoping you people can at least put a cool border around it instead of leaving it as a black bar. I know you people can make cool borders. Thanks for your attention!",
        "Hey guys, huge fan of the kingdom hearts series and also the game in general. Though one thing I wish you could add is the option to link your data to your Google Play account as well as Facebook. Not a lot of us use Facebook so I wish there was more options to get your data back if you ever deleted the app. Otherwise, good game!",
        "I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn't really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.",
        "[Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!"

        "Fantastic game.I am loving this game. Still there is few problem.Miniclips please solve the issues. After players matching ,game is hacked/stopped by several times.Only way to win that kind of match,any of one player has to quit or network issues.Its waste of time,also harm for devices (battery drainage,high heating). So,admin plz look after these prob.Why it's hanging or hacking.",
        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "Could you please enable the user to save his progress in a Gmail account??  So that, when you lost or change your phone, you can recover the level and progress you had before instead of restarting from the beginning!!!!!!!!!!!!   If you could allow more media for sharing the game, it would be better, Facebook is not the only social media!!   And sometimes, it bugs!! Sometimes, the game is very slow and causes you to lose. Indeed, you shoot but the ball goes after many seconds even though the connexion is good!! Consequently you loose against a weak player, And this makes very angry!!!   Should those problems fixed, I will rate 5 stars.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person."

        "I stop playing C C because I loved this game... I noticed that we use way more than we get!! And to only get a few tickets for every 10 Bingo's then having to wit for 22hrs....only 4 tickets and hr...and it takes way to long to get to the next level and when do reach it we get very little tickets!!! Dont have to many deals to get both tickets and special prizes... Also how does it when a game starts right after a tournament that I end up in the thousand plus  rank below the bronze??? As much as I love this game think its time to give it a rest until there re more incentives to bring me back!!!",
        "My game keep freezing up and not submitting my scores not giving me boosters I acquired during that round. Please fix the issues and give me back my points and boosters. Thank you   I just played again and I played the whole game but when it's time to tally the score the game freezes. I lost 3 footballs and a treasure chest plus my points. Please respond to my issues. I haven't heard from anyone yet. But I still like the game. Just want it to stop robbing me....",
        "This is definitely a fun bingo app. Where it's lacking or otherwise could be improved, comparatively to ther Bingo games, is the daily spin wheel & daily sign in bonus. Daily 24hr sign in should provide a much larger number of free tickets & include daily free power ups. Earning one or two power ups w a single spin of the wheel is anticlimactic! Power ups are a vital way to  daily tournament advancement, bingo wins & simy make playing more fun. Completing a pizzule is impossible without power-ups or making a purchase. However, a big win for this app. is the ability to sign in each new day to a new tournament which helps level the playing field. Special tournaments and/or the add' side bonuses, like the \"turkey daub\" made playing & making a purchase worth wild!",
        "Good, keeps me coming back for more. The only thing I don't like is there is no way of getting that many puzzle pieces in the time. Could you maybe let us play till we get the Puzzle Complete to get the rewards.",
        "I am addicted to this game. I think you should get more power ups instead of ticket's. Cause you run out of power up's. I feel you should get bingo power up's instead of ticket's. On the bonus spin they should add bingo power up's of 4. I need more bingo power up's. And would like to get power up's for daubing every number called each game. I need more power Up's. And the game should give you tickets when you get every number that is called correctly on each card every game that you play.",
        "The new additions of the outlaws was great, but then you added all these \"special\" days that serve no purpose but to make people spend money. I have spent plenty already but not for every game. Sorry guys, bad move. Too greedy."

        "This game is perfect for those who played any moba style game. 2 buddies of mine play this the same we used to back in the first 2 years of league of legends. Short games, almost no existence of any real \"pay to win\". No heavy dedication required to get started. Great for the casual and hardcore gamer. Not for those who haven't even seen a moba style game before. Just needs more items to buy in game, but can't expect perfection from the start. Overall 4.7 from me",
        "Cool game very fun few negative though. Snowballing is way to easy one death and you basically lose lane. The controls need to be better they need a target lock mode. Its hard to keep on your target even with hero icons on. Being able to only use the jungle talent if you have a jungling item on sucks. its so hard to comeback if any bit behind as i said snowballing is to large.",
        "If you love League of Legends are definitely going to like and enjoy playing this game. One of the best games out there. You don't need to spend any money to be one of the best players it's all about skill and having a good team structure it's nothing about spending hundreds of dollars of real cash to get the best items because there are no best items! You do not have to pay to play this game and be the best!",
        "The connection and reconnecting sucks, I always end up idle or AFK because apparently my connection sucks but it's perfectly fine. Reconnecting takes forever and by the time it's done the game is already over and I'm reported for AFK when it's not even my fault the game's connection sucks.   Other than that the game is fun to play and a good time consumer but they need to work on better connection. I kept on getting warnings for my AFK when the game kept on glitching and it affected my phone so I had to restart the whole thing.",
        "Way better than Mobile Legends. I use to be  Mobile Legends Die-Hard All the way but this is the best MOBA out there. I have no idea why this does not have 50+million downloads. ? Do Not Judge By Front cover. PLAY THIS AND SEE WHEN YOU REACH RANKED MATCHES MY FELLOW MOBA PLAYERS.",
        "Played both the international version (arena of valor) and the Chinese version (honor of kings). It is the better mobile moba in the market with great control and smooth gameplay. Having DC heros in the roster is a big plus.   Downside is the lack of content compared to the Chinese version. Sure it's a fairly new game, but if this game wants to be as successful as honor of kings it need a lot more content to keep players engaged. More meaningful events (not the crappy one that give you 5 gold for winning matches), way better skins (seriously check out the skins in honor of kings, so much better) thats actually appealing to people. And please let people unlock arcana pages with gems instead of paying real money."

My game since the update has been freezing up and lagging to the point that I select something (a wall for example) and the whole  game freezes and takes a million years just to LOAD. If this game isn't fixed, I'm demanding all my money spent on the game refunded and uninstallment. Not happy.",
        "The more I play the more this game is broken ... the AI for the troupes constantly suicide even if you keep rallying them , I am lvl 169 and I am constantly getting attacked by lvl 220 and up no lies , I can give screenshots because that is fair ... this is 1-5 times at least per hour ... this game from very fun became very frustrating. The game creators could give 2 sh/ts about what is going on .",
        "My phone is not rooted or jail broken, I do not have any hacks installed. I get a message saying illegal program detected by XIGNCODE3. Even after multiple uninstalls/installs, reboots, cache clears. All that time and energy wasted!!!",
        "This is the game I have been searching for. But can't give 5 star because of 2 main reasons. Consume too many data while playing that required fast network and too many bugs... Problems free=5 stars.. What happen? I cannot even play the game now.. I once install and play and later uninstall because of game problem. Now I install and try to play again. I cannot play.. What is the problem? I also want to recover my account too..",
        "Gameplay and graphics is great BUT as you progress you spend more time upgrading units and buildings. Some upgrades take up to a week of upgrading rendering those villagers useless aswell as the rate at which resources comes in as you collect doesnt compensate enough for the costs of upgrades. Its unnecessarily STRETCHED OUT. because of this its a 3 star rating...DONT DOWNLOAD IF YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE. Been playing a year and i dont feel my progress is a representation of the time i have put in. Been playing almost daily!",
        "This is the exact definition of a strategy game, the controls are great and its free. You get to choose your own nation which just adds to the strategy, plus whatever you do in a battle can affect the entire battle. I would recommend it to people who want something with strategy and a bit of hardcoreness. The learning curve is quite steep sometimes."

Game will be deleted if they don't fix the problem.",
        "The game is awesome, except for the fact that to be truly.competetive they are asking for absurd amounts of money that in some countries even in Europe are equal to monthly salaries... And that just for the possibility to get same heroes as other \"richer\" players :(",
        "Very pricy game with limited game play. You will spend a lot of money to advance. There is no other reasonable way to play. Too many moderators/players( they play for free) who steal/destroy resources causing you to spend even more money. The game is a money pit. Stay away.",
        "Please fix the launch. I cant log in. i have reinstalled it multiple times. If it is a maintenance thing or update,shouldnt you at least talk about it in your facebook page or forum?If I lose my account because of this....",

While it's a P2W game, I assure you it is fun and addicting for just casual play. Lots of contents in the game to keep you playing.  Finally, DEAR DEVELOPERS kindly reduce the stamina consumption and the number of soul stones needed for raising stars. This helps us, casual players, a lot."

        "It's a good story and all. But I only wish they would let me save up energy or at least give me a little more. It gets frustrating when I can't Carry on, I'm not a patient person. Graphics are good. Controls are good. Story is great! Loving most of this game so far. I just hope they change the energy part of it. Though I guess it's a lot easier to read thn most episode stories.",
        "I love the story Line just like I've been reading in the comments the energy sucks I know it's just to keep us from reading the story so fast an to blow our money on, but if there was another way instead of us waiting for so long for just a little energy it's defently keeping me from downloading another game like this.. it takes so long to receive the 300 energy I done forgot an really not into the story Like I was when I 1st downloaded it.",
        "The story and art art great, like in the other game, and I love the music too.  I have 2 major complaints though: 1. It's not indicated anywhere in the appstore that this is a work in progress (there's currently 4 chapters in English). This particularly bothers me since I bought energy so I could get immersed in the story, only to be torn out of that immersion by an incomplete story. 2. The energy system. I mentioned this in my review for the Drogo one as well, and plenty of people pointed it out here so I won't go into detail.",
        "I think all of these Is it love stories are absolutely amazing. The writing has given me inspiration to read more romance novels. But I don't like the energy system. I foolishly paid a lot of money to read/play longer and I'm glad the author and developers get the money for a product I thoroughly enjoy. I just wish the daily energy was 1000 or something",
        "Amazing story... When will there be more chapters?! I also don't like how I have to buy energy in order to not just have five minutes (maybe) of reading the story and making decisions. Please come out with more chapters soon!",
        "Loving the story so far and the graphics.. It's all so beautiful. Only wish that they would give you more energy over time to read it.. when you lose time to read you lose interest in the story by the waiting. Help us stay interested!"

        "Nice game but the random number generator is non existent. Hold three numbers and roll again, even with free or earned additional rolls, are ALWAYS the same number that was there! This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",
        "Love the game! But recently did an update for the app now my game glitches out. Takes forever to roll the dice. Only updated the app cuz it said they fixed bugs & made faster well it did the opposite for my app.",
        "Showdown is a joke!  100% guarantee opponent will get a double Yahtzee every single game.  Their average score is 320+ when a normal person scores 250-275.  Impossible enough to score a Yahtzee yourself but double is almost unheard of.",

        "Fun",
        "The game has bugged out now the hero's that did the time challenges are stuck I cant get them back.  I think it happend when the anniversary update hit and I put them in a time challenges during the time.  When I prestige and go to the time challenges it goes straight back to the main menu. And when i do have hero's  in the adventure mode it cuts to them when I pick the time challenges.  Please fix this.  And also happy anniversary 😀   Problem was fixed thank you very much!😊",
        "The game is fine but like all mobile games or eventually gets to the point where it's purely about you parting with money to proceed. That being said even tho this game uses ads for it's reward system it's actually quite pleasant, at no point did it become ridiculous or over the top. I really do appreciate how much of a back seat it it feels like the adds are taking to gameplay.",
        "Almost A Hero is an incredibly fun game with lots of interesting heros to use to battle near endless hordes of baddies. I find myself loading up the game multiple times a day to grab the free chest as well as to push through another couple waves before my next prestige. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this genre!",
        "Update: Ads are broken. I watched almost any that were presented to me in order to get farther faster but now they literally always load up a few seconds, then the game like restarts and I get jack from it. Dudes! Please fix, I am so very rarely addicted to a game like I am/was with this!!  Literally the best clicker/idle game I've ever played. I was glued to my phone for all of my free time five days straight because new and awesome stuff kept getting unlocked."

        "Not really easy to understand how to get started playing the game. I had to figure out a lot of it for myself but having to do that got frustrating so after a few days I just decided to uninstall it. It presents as cute and entertaining but trying to learn a game with minimal instruction doesn't give a great first impression",
        "This is one of my favorite mobile games. My only issue recently is I spent money on coins after a level to finally finish it but the game crashed and I ended up having to start the game over smh it keeps crashing but this is the first time it crashed without fixing itself...hope you guys do something about that",
        "Update: I read where you stated\" Our developers only release levels after they personally ensure that levels  are beatable without the use of purchase's\".  I was wondering, do they play a level for a week like I am so far trying to complete it? Are they really playing or it's what the computer tells them? I doubt that any of you are actually playing this game.",
        "I have played this game for months and it was fantastic until the last 2 updates. After those the levels became so hard it's impossible to beat them without spending money. If you enjoy playing the same level for weeks at a time then by all means download. Otherwise don't waste your time unless you want to spend money.",
        "Fun game but today while I have been playing, when I hit give up it keeps going to the 25 coins for 5 more moves no matter how many times I hit it. I have had to exit the app and reopen it to play the level again without spending coins. I hope this is just a glitch and not trying to get people to spend more money.",
        "I love this game however, it has taken multiple lives from me for no reason. The game starts you off with 5 lives & then I accrued 10 lives from winning multiple lives from extra spins. All of a sudden the lives just disappeared and I was reduced to just 5 lives again. This is the 2nd time this happened to me which sucks cause the game is fun as hell."

        "I absolutely LOVE this game!! The stories of each character are amazing! I just wish they had more suitors. And I wish they made more games exactly like this but with a completely new story line and characters. Like, I love the voice animations and how long the chapters are and how long the story line of each person is. I also love how your character talks like a modern day girl when she's at the sengoku era. You don't have to pay to see more about each person either. It's amazing. I Love this app. Please make more!!!! ❤️❤️❤️",
        "So, this is my third update. That's how much I love this game 😂. Thank you for giving us castle and closet space via game events. Very helpful. I don't have anymore lag issues. And I appreciate the diversity in storylines. No route is the same, unlike other Otome games. Also, the relationship development is fantastic - not too slow or fast. The main character actually talks like a real person and less like a \"character\". Art is beautiful, too. I just feel bad that I can't say much about the music or voice acting, as I usually have my phone on vibrate.",
        "Idk what to say, but one thing for sure I really loveee this game!!!! Is so awesome, the chara omg so magnificent. I don't mind spending much money on this game hahaha it's so freaking beautiful!!! And I really love the MC she's so strong and cute, it's just like I want to have a route for MC too. But rn I'm waiting for KENSHIN UESUGI route, I hope it will come out soon. Damn, Cybird always make such a beautiful otome game. Thank you for making this game, it just made my life💗💗💗💗",
        "I couldn't resist to do a newer version of the review, so here it is. I've been playing this game for nearly three months now, and that's saying something. First of all, the story is really engaging. The characters are really sweet, and I love how we don't need to spend money to enjoy it, unlike other otome games. Shout-out to the people who made Ieyasu's route a dream come true.",
        "There are only a few routes out currently but they are wonderful all the same. The main character is funny and reacts realistically to situations! Not to mention the voice acting is impeccable like wow I don't speak a word of Japanese but everytime Nobunaga speaks I'm just nodding along. Also this game has an adorable animated series and it is the best",
        "The most romantic and sweetest experience of falling in love game..  I feel like I'm truly falling in love with Masamune date.. Love his playful side, his sweetness,  fierce yet gentle  sometimes.. The only reason I CANNOT RATE 5 STAR is I cant read back the route chosen even though I have spent actual money..  Its like I'm purchasing the story,  but the fact is,  I'm not.. This is frustrating..  Atleast after having spending so much money,  we can keep the story to be read again afterwards..  Please reconsider this..  Thank you"

Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

But it ain't working. Can you help me out? Cuz if u help me, I personally feel you guys deserve a 5 star :)",

        "If you continuously win you lose continuously and if you have a lot of chips you'll lose the chips know why? This games is money hungry and wants you to buy stuff I had 25 million and now I have 13 million because the dealer got 20 2 times in a row mabey if you made the cards random and didint do what I complained about I would've gave this 5 stars.",

        "Works good on my Sony Xperia XZs. Only problem is if I'm doing an impoppable track and I'm using Monkey Engineers. On those few levels where a mass of regeneration bloons come in, the game lags like hell. My workaround for that has been to be lame and just get sun gods",
        "Bloons TDs have always been a favorite of mine. But I'm only giving 3 stars because of a technical issue that's mind boggling. I'm on a galaxy note 8, and I start to experience game halting slowdown on level 79. I had played this game on my note 4, and could easily double that before the hardware struggled. Please please fix it",
        "I love this game. It works great on my phone.  My only problem is that I had to reinstall it and I don't know how to get everything back. If you could help that would be great. Also to be totally honest, I'm pretty sure I didn't save it to the cloud or my Facebook account.",
        "Extemely good game for pretty much any age or level of play. Easy to get into and there's enough depth of game that it will take a lot of playing to get bored. Also works well on any platform - I have it on my ipad and Samsung phone. :)",
        "I love this game only problem is I broke my phone and had to get a new one. Trying to figure out how to get everything back. I have purchased alot of things. $31000 and now only have $100. Logged in with my Facebook account still nothing. Help!!!! Please so I can get back to enjoying this game!",
        "Too many bugs. In Co op, you can't send money to anyone if anything is under the menu that comes out to give money and the menu covers a good 30% of your side to do so. Also it doesn't let you play towers close to the outside edge in Co op even though you can in single player. And it is SOOOO stupid after every round, it cancels towers you are trying to place. That makes me mad especially since you can't talk to your team mates during a match to tell them to wait so I can place a tower."

Communication is key to victory and should be given to those who earn it and are serious about the game and want to become the Elite. Overall a great game even after 3+ years of gameplay. You will make tons of friends here so join already ;-)",

        "Plarium do not like Aussies. They charge us extra money for offers.   A top end offer is $100 USD for the Americans. Which is $120-125 AUD after currency conversion for Australians. Yet for some reason our offers are $160 AUD. $35 AUD more then we should be paying.   I do not know how this practice has gone without incident as I thought there were supposed to be good anti descrimination laws and consumer laws in place that prevent the charging of extra to countries just because they do not like that country.   This is a morally disgusting practice as it is the same concept as charging more to others purely on the basis because they have a different skin colour, gender or religion.   I want to know why Australians are paying an extra $35 AUD then we should be as other mobile games. One example being Battle Mobile do the correct currency exchange rate and only charge $125 AUD after conversion from $100 USD. If other mobile games do it correctly why are Plarium choosing not to?  Edit: @ Plarium employee who just lied in response to me. Plarium set all prices up themselves through Google Playstore. NOT Google.",

        "WOW. This game has everything! My only complaint is that the \"earning\" free in game currency section (downloading and playing other games to certain level), does not yield in game currency, so do not bother. Just pay for stuff when it goes on sale. But otherwise, WOW! This is like fanfic, sims, empire, battle, idle, all in one! Hpw often do you get an all in one game based off an amazing franchise?? (As of this date, ive been playing for 2 months, spent $10)",
        "I reckon this is the best game in the world!! I am a enormous fan of how to train your dragon, so i reckon you have done an awesome job at making this game. But, the only problem is i don't like the part when it loads and takes forever, and sometimes it doesn't even load and yo have to use wifi and takes up alot of storage on your device. So i sugest decreasing those things or stopping those things.",
        "First everything went out smoothly. Now the assets keeps on redownloading everytime I try to play it. My phone still has 7gb free memory, I also tried following ghe suggestion to clear up some space it still doesn't work. But overall it was awesome. I just hope the issue of redownloading will get fixed asap.",
        "When you complete a level in the currently available adventure, you may spin a wheel. Why do I always get resources? Do I seriously need 18 cards worth of resources, each card worth approximately 1 million fish or wood? Please tweek the chances of getting something else! I don't even mind getting lots of sage fruit at this point... At least it would be useful. Resources aren't really useful when you are filled up on resources.",
        "Love the game. Just wish it gave a little more direction on what and how to do certain things. And wish you didn't have to wait hours sometimes 19 to hatch an egg. But they do give you the option to pay to speed up the process. Also wish that they weren't so stingy with giving ruins/coins to pay for things they ask you to do.",
        "Love it! I downloaded this for my kids who love the movies and TV series, but I've become addicted! I've spent a bit of money over the roughly 6-9 months I've had it, but I haven't minded. The earn free runes has created issues in random phone calls and spam emails, so I don't use that anymore.   I agree with someone else's comment about the Book of Dragons - I found it much easier previously. Also, I've had a red number on mine for weeks and I still can't work out what it's for...I've searched through the book, I'm searching for dragons when I can, and still no idea what it's about.   I keep getting the download new assets but I know that's because my phone is full and I can't delete anything else LOL. I'm looking to upgrade my phone soon so hopefully it will stop that.  Overall, it's definitely a game I'd recommend (and I have). Thanks."

I do not know if grand casino and just the other than games are with the same people that comment I made the other day was for the grand casino games, because it has always been not so good with winnings. Sorry. I am loving GSN again Thanks. Good games. Some of my favorites.",
        "Love all the games, but you need to let us win more often.  And also check your game, because it has frozen on me and I lost over 2 million points.",
        "Come on GSN. I too have noticed a drop in payouts. You can do better. would hate to uninstall the game but disappointed with not getting big payouts when I have been a loyal player. When GSN does well I rate it well, when it doesn't, I have to report that too. If you look at the trend of reviews, many see a drop in payouts.",
        "Good variety of . Available videos to watch. It's very slow lately trying to get a game to load or the challenges don't always load.  Frustrating.",
        "You really need to consider making an option to disable the music but not the sound. I was playing bingo but quit because the music sucks and was giving me a headache.",
        "This has always been one of my favorite apps for slot and poker play.  It is becoming the best.   Lately my coins have been lasting for weeks, there are fun tournaments to get into, the payouts are way more often.   I can't say enough about the entertainment I get plying GSN Casino."

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

        "LOVE this game and have done for such a long time as I'm a huge KK fan. My only issue is, that it's pay to play for sure.  It's hard to make money and gain k stars. Everything is OVER PRICED. Even to just furnish your home. I hope kim and Glu reconsider this as not everyone has money to splash on what you need to progress more quickly.",
        "I've spent probably thousands on this game because I liked it, but I'm having serious problems. Back on March 13Th I bought yet another hundred dollar kstar pack that did not go through. I was able to confirm the order and they \"added it to my account\". The problem is I still haven't gotten it. And I've sent screenshots showing I have not gotten it. I've purchased several other packs of various prices and I've received them all, but I've still, to this day, not received the hundred dollar one. I keep getting bounced around and told \"just do a hard reset\" which I've already done several times as well as turning off my phone and everything. That doesn't explain why I've gotten the other purchases but not this one. On top of that, the \"help\" I've been getting has been taking longer and longer to even respond, each time though I'm getting the same unhelpful answers.  If it was five dollars I would have just forgotten it, but I'm being screwed out of 100 dollars with no answers. I'm extremely disappointed.  Buyers beware.",
        "Pretty cool game. I did buy the small star pack and it never showed up. Kinda lame. If someone could look into it that'd be great. I would just like to receive the stars. Not a refund. Please and thank you",
        "So...I'm thinking Kim kardashian again puts her name on something that would flop...but this is surprisingly a great game. I'm addicted to trying to level up etc. Worth a download.   Update- game won't start.  I'm losing progress in the game. Hope this gets fixed soon"

Stops... So please, fix this bug I really wanna play this cool game... Thanks and have a great day!",

After several attempts if at all the server menu loads, the game kicks me out when I try to login my account. I tried repairing the game many times, reinstalled it too many times, but the same problem persists. Hope your team will look into the matter soon. Thank you!",

Reinstalled dozen times and Repaired using there repair icon on start menu (because of always server busy). Game always updates especially on patches .. Spent more time on fixing the game to make it work than playing it. And ..l.. for your latest update. Btw. My phone is s8+. And got decent internet connection."

        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance"

Im trying my best to play this game that i loved and win some good characters but why is it everytime in road to glory there is a network issue well in fact in other game modes there is none. PLEASE FIX THIS NET ISSUE WERE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO WIN BUT ENDED UP LOSING BECAUSE OF THE NET ISSUE. . Thanks. I love this game so much so please be fair.",

        "Love the app and the game it is very addictive. I love the changes to season 4; however your ticket store and CP PVP store is still bugged as I am still getting cards well below my rank. Also PVP is very buggy as I am always seeing waiting for opponent or opponent is viewing last match which isn't an option. Just wondering if there is a security team that monitors online activity because it seems like a lot of people are manipulating the network at times.",
        "I like the game but last week 2 of my cards where removed I didn't accidentally delete them. They was locked. I emailed and got told that there was nothing they can do. It is a Titan pro Neville and a beast pro Tamina can someone help me get my cards back I played a lot of games to pro them right",

Do not let the WWE license fool you, this is NOT a company I would support and I'm not sure why WWE can't find another company to produce a game.like this.",

Performance is the worst is all i can say. Not strictly pay to win but almost still fun while free and has been for years. I just hope it works decently on your device as performance has just gotten worse over the years on my dozens of devices.

He/she denied me, refused to take liability, even though I can prove it all. At first I didn't want my money back, I wanted my account back. It hurts me to say you refused to help a spending player. You guys basically stole my accounts and my money.",

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Please give us the option to disable Auto Target Tracking in settings.  The auto tracking can cause you to fire at ships your not wanting to target, especially if there lined up side by side. And cause your shots to fall way short or too far if the enemy ship is coming straight towards you. If love to have the ability to disable this feature in the settings."

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go."

        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points."

        "The team solved all my issues. Beautiful game, new twist on an already good concept. Loving it! Can't stop! Addicted!",
        "Kiefer cloned last day on earth, but with a med evil twist and a dark souls money grab name, it's has the same garbage energy system, but no adds to replenish it, same \"multiplayer\" if u can call it that (they are ai if u didn't know) and all the sad micro-transaction sales are ripping ppl off and not giving the items perchesed (if u ask me u deserve  it for buying micro-transactions) and the devs don't seem to be fixing this problem or even acknowledging it. But...I am in love with this game it seems to be better than last day on earth with much more depth with the addition  of quests, lore, and the med evil theme as for all the negative reviews I read aboot bad game play seems to some up to too many casuals playing a game that requires skill and patience, yes the game is a grind but that is to be expected from a free to play rpg and if that is not what ur interested in I suggest u avoid this game as the grind is slow and tedious, but if grinding is ur thing this is the game for u, as u lvl up it becomes much more rewarding, and addictive. Can't wait to see what the devs add in future updates (charcoal for fuel would be a nice addition like in last day on earth, more unique events would also be nice) but at the moment I love this game and just can't put it down. Glad to see new updates although I think they missed the mark on some much needed necessities like cooking wood into char coal but I love the fact they added the ability to unbundled progress as I think they have needed this since ldoe was released but better late than never.",
        "Very similar to the dark souls style obviously, I'm frikkin loving it, lovely survival style, it's not hard to survive and it has a great, easy functioning gameplay, only flaw is that it doesn't have a female version of the character...big flaw",
        "Great game, wish there was something to gain more energy, and a hp, or energy lvl cap off, max hp should go up like 2hp per lvl gained. Idk more stats that the player can tweak for gameplay",
        "I'm so suprised no other big shots copying this game like everyone did to clash of clan."

        "Matt seems like kind of an asshat in Season 2. She should just dump him. Could do way better. Like with Daryl perhaps? He obviously cares for her wayyy more than Matt does. Matt only has eyes for Lana. Like he says he loves our girl? I don't think so. I wish you could choose somebody else to date.",
        "Energy is too short & there isn't anything other than a side game for 100 more points to keep you entertained. The app is basically a story with a couple of nice artistic pictures.  Way over priced. You can buy a book for less at Barnes and Nobles and still get twice the amount in content. The the amount of money they ask for engery in this game is ridiculous. Don't be silly  and spend money that you can do better with. Just play for free or not at all.",
        "I think it's a good game but... Let's be fair you don't get to play for long each day before you run out of energy and have to wait 24 hours and even then it's only a few minutes play.... The lack of play time makes me loose all interest in what I believe might be a decent game",
        "So. This is an addictive store. The main characters are very well thought out. A few Grammer error and hick ups in game play. Although this game can be expensive if you don't make the right choice. I had bought the same secret scene twice and it still asks me to buy it. This is the second time this has happened. All in all great game.",
        "I find it aggravating that your energy goes down so fast. You get a few seconds of free play per day. I've paid to get more. But I can't and won't keep doing that when even paying for extra doesn't last long. 😒"

Love going back levels to see if i can get the feather.   Coin packages need to be more attractive if you want people to spend real money and tbe power up packages are way too expensive. Still....... i love the game",
        "Well did love the game not now as it's taken me a long time to get off one level even brought more coins just to get. Only just now finished the last one I mean really come on now. Wat a joke  This why I've given a low rate",
        "I'm addicted to the game. The only problem is that you are not given power ups that you earn. I spend good money paying for power ups so, I would like to get the ones that I earn for finishing levels. Thanks.",

        "This is the best game i could find on the app store, me being a fan of space x and NASA this is amazing! But however the microtransactions changed the game for me. I feel like everyone should get access to these parts, but however those can purchase the premium version of the game cam get early access, supported the development team and the owner as a lot of great work goes into this game, and you only need a few minutes into the game to show how much detail is put in.",
        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though."

Too much a pain in the ass when you get stuck on a floor cause you can't beat the boss with current gear but you need to advance to get better gear.",

U keep getting full bags.. When u try organizing, it full again in before u finish...and much more.. In my opinion.. It's not a really a game..  well just money sucker maybe.. (Just my opinion).",
        "Picked this game up because it looked kind of like Nonstop Knight, and I liked Nonstop Knight. Unfortunately, it's not LIKE Nonstop Knight, it IS Nonstop Knight. It's a lazy reskin of the same game with more micro transactions bolted on.  Don't waste your time. Nonstop Knight is more fun and it won't do everything in its power to drain your bank account.",
        "Stay away from this game all it does is rollback after you do stuff in game it's so great to get to lvl50 3 days in row to just be knocked back to lvl47 3 plus times a day.  They steal items gained, don't bother to reset attempts, just waste of time.",
        "The gms in this game care nothing for their players. There was a \"rollback\" bug that liked to remember everything you spent, but not any of the rewards or achievements you recieved. After losing over 4k gems, multiple pieces of advanced gear, a very rare talent, countless forge points, and even a rare pet, they decide to give everyone 1000 gems as a \"shut up, take this even though we know you lost so much, but we aren't doing anything else to keep our players\" as a reply pretty much.  The game it's way to buggy and full of support that just doesn't care about their players are all. I would never suggest playing this game to anyone.",
        "As promised here's my edit. The latest update seemed to resolve the issue, at least for me. Although I see in chat others are still having the issue so hopefully this will get resolved for good. Thank you for your speedy service."

        "After the latest update, I've only gotten one set of daily quests which populated right after the update. After that, I haven't received any additional daily quest where I can win some gems. Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

        "This is a very convenient app. All of my favorite stories are in one place. Just one issue only, I want to transfer my data to a new device & I am having trouble doing so. I have managed to successfully transfer all my old data to this new app before, but I would like to transfer my new & existing data to another device. I have registered & followed all of the instructions to the tee on the transfer form & it always says \"could not transfer data\" . Also there is no fill space on the form that prompts to fill in  'Support ID'. I hope this gets looked into.",
        "I find this app very convenient and like it a lot. But there are a few small bugs(eg. BMP's scene transition fx) and if possible, I hope the data on device can be stored in the SD card as it's taking up quite a lot of space. Thank you very much for the hard work and improving the app all the time, Voltage. ^^",
        "I have no problem anything except the roulette. I hope Voltage will change the value of coins from 5 to 10(bronze), 10 to 50 (silver) and 100 (gold) remains the same.  It requires unfathomable patience for how many days just to get the whole story. One chapter for 100 coins, I'm fine with it if it has only 5 chapters but aside from too many chapters it has also separated sequels and epilogues. *cries*  Please reconsider changing the amount of coins. Hopes for better system and greater stories.",
        "Loved it,even though at the beginning,i 'm a bit skeptical about it, it is kinda efficient in some way.but i do miss the standlone apps.also the login bonus is quite dissapointing,like we only get 5-10? At least give us a bit of generous amount like 10-20 coins",
        "For anyone looking for an MC who isn't a pushover, try the newer stories. Our Private Homeroom stands out as unusually well-localized, to the point it feels like someone studied the English speaking hemisphere of the Internet for modern slang. I very much appreciate the upgrade in sass and backbone, so it was pretty well done nonetheless. I've been a monthly subscriber for months with no intention to change this.",
        "Prices aren't competitive with paperback books. Why spend $4 per chapter when I can buy a 400 paged book new for $8. Also, the daily login bonus gives 5-10 coins per day; it would take months to unlock a single chapter at that rate. The only thing thia app has going for it is the free story every 2 weeks. 🙏🙏🙏 I suggest making this work more like Voltage's Lovestruck app & also letting us watch adds in exchange for coins."

        "Challenging game against live players. Lots of contests and bonuses. Levels of play from beginner to world class. One drawback: all levels are open entry, so more experienced (and less ethical) players will enter into Beginner to collect quick victories. The designers should change the game so that once a badge is completed, players should not be able to enter games on that level again. This would be fair play for beginners, encouraging them to continue playing. Hope this is implemented in an update.",
        "Game graphics and play are great. However dice rolls are seriously flawed. Doubles way too often. Not even close to real rolling. I've seen 2 sets of doubles in way to many starts of the game. If doubles are so common why don't you ever see 3 doubles in a row to start. Don't ever leave a piece open because the next roll will knock you almost every time. The developer obviously likes frustration proven by the childish limited chat emojis.",
        "They need to fix the dice roll. Its absolutely a big cheat...no way can some roll exactly what they need to get out of a tight position that often. Its really horrible it ruins the whole game.",
        "I think it's safe to say based on the dice timing, that this game app, like all the rest, is favoring a particular player in order to end the game quicker. The auto play is annoying and not possible to turn off.. but the layout is nice.",
        "It's the worst game i have ever played , they are thieves , when you double and you lose they deduct twice the bet and when u win they only give you 45 percent of ur total winning money.I played a game and won 255 thousand , but they only gave me 120 thousand , and when i lost they took out 255 thousand from my money.If you dont believe me count ur chips and see.They suck so go to hell with this lame unfair idiot game.",

Now tight as the other casino.  Update: super tight with wins.  Haven't been able to keep 1mil in a long time. Update: seriously!?  Loosen up some. I need a jackpot!!",
        "One of the better slots app out there. I have had many and most the time they are uninstalled as fast as they are installed. Still trying to figure out a couple of things like the high five blue hand and the crowns...how do you earn them?   Otherwise I love it easy to play and the rewards are really good too!!! Thanks Big Fish❣❣ Still enjoying the game",
        "I gave it a 3 because the minimum bet is still a little high and you can't play if you don't have enough. If he got his lower the minimum bats then I'll give it a 5. I am having fun playing the game though just want to put that out there",
        "It's impossible to get bored with this app. It has a wide variety of the most creative, fun games with HUGE payouts and bonuses!! And no interruptions with ads. It's addictive, in a good way. You'll never want to play any other app. This is the BEST one out there! I 💜 it!!! So will you!",
        "Well done BF this is another great slots app!! I only give you 4 🌟s because of the glitches. For example; I haven't been able to play the new Leprechaun game sine the last update and I'm not signed in through Facebook so if I uninstall the app then reinstall it I'll lose everything. Also I have great 100 Mbps WiFi but still get bumped out room, especially if I'm on a winning streak. Fix my Leprechaun game and give you 5⭐s across the board!!",

Contact a real Agent in usually less than 24hrs by email. They may actually set up a phone call if needed. Just give them a try...it's free, free, free."

BUT the support and appeals system is terrible. I've been contacting appeals for 2 weeks about my accidental ban with no reply I've spent well over 800 bucks so I'm not sure what to do now.",
        "Such an amazing game. Been playing since 2013 and loved every bit of it. There's still some work to be done with the whole system. An event that happened on 20/1/2018 my clans banks (Biggest bank on arawn- Braves and resurgence) had there passwords changed by an ex resurgence general. Chief of resurgence got it back then on the 20th OTM gave it back to the scammer! That me me furious. Otherwise the game is great.",
        "If you are into getting better equipment all the time, then this can get boring quick... I was loving it at first but getting better equipment is based SOLEY on npc merchants and quests... Theres fishing and cooking, but you cannot make gear.. No magic item drops... The equipment system in this is very linear..",
        "Dissapointed. One thumb mobile are terrible at getting issues resolved. Recently there's been a duping scandal where many innocent people have been caught in the cross fire, including clan banks stocked with several years of raid spoils. How they don't have measures in place to deal with these kinds of issues is beyond me.",
        "I only just started, and the games itself is wicked cool, but even after the tutorial, I just can't figure out how to use the player chat. It sort of glitches out and won't let my type anything. Is this a game problem, or a mistake on my part?",
        "I usually don't do reviews, but this game definently deserves it! Easy to pick up and get sucked into. Good amount of classes to choose from and customization is very refined. And finally, an mmorpg that doesn't contain a bunch of anime freak characters and outrageous weapons and armor. Such an enjoyable game."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

        "This game crashes more than drunk drivers on a Saturday night. It was the fun the first day but a day later it crashes without even getting through the loading screen?? Fix your game.",
        "Well made game, lovely graphics, and not very pay-to-win. I love it. Never encountered any of the bugs/crashes the others mentioned so I can't say much about that. It's a smooth experience for me.",
        "So many crashes. Daily 50-100. I cant take this anymore. I think I might quit if this problem will not be resolved. Cache cleared many times. This game is not worth daily constant crashes.",
        "Enjoyable on every front EXCEPT when I receive fb messenger notifications and I use the \"quick reply\" without opening the app, the keyboard slides the entire application up half way and after I send it takes up to 30 seconds to correct itself if it does at all.  Idk but maybe make it so it allows over lay of keyboards? Or whatever coding nightmare that might bring...just figured I'd mention it"

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

He uses all abilities with 0 cool down time, he keeps getting armor, shield, and healing... making winning impossible, unless you are +20 levels higher than him.",
        "It's a fun, easy, addictive game. My ONLY complaint is that even when you buy a card, you don't get to CHOOSE which Character you are getting. If I'm paying $100 for something, I better get to PICK what I'm getting - this game doesn't let you do that.  I also think it takes WAY TOO LONG to evolve Characters, and overall the add-ons are FAR TOO EXPENSIVE for what you are getting, but you don't HAVE TO spend money if you don't want to.",
        "The game is a great game, I love how they added characters from all eras, it sorta reminds me of turtles in time. The only huge downfall of this game is that it's pretty much a pay to play game smh. I've never seen a game that is so money hungry in my life. The $10 monthly subscription  is absurd, the SFX ingame dont work and for 5 bucks more you can play Elder scrolls online that has a ton of content compare to this game.",
        "Subscription should come with better benefits. $10 a month...6 months worth I could've bought an xbox game. Ya know. Pizza re-gen should be a bit quicker. Some people like to grind. And the pizza limitation kills the grind. Good graphics tho, and great characters. But waaaay to hard to acquire the turtles. Big let down on that aspect",
        "Great game just wished Very amazing game especially if you are a turtles fan.. lots of choices with characters.. you can definitely get stronger without having to pay.. you just need to put in the time , and do  do daily event's.. i wish some characters were easier to get;))",
        "After a long battle with the worst customer service i have ever dealt with i will regrettably no longer be playing this game. The game itself is pretty solid but is a money sink. If you need help from the company you may as well quit. The game is a solid 4/5 but the company's attitude and considering you being disposable sadly makes them a 1/10"

        "I really love this game but ever since the most recent update , everytime I try to open the standard hunt screen it starts merging with the dog hunt screen and doesn't let me do anything. Also it's really a huge Hassel to get silver eagles and that makes the game play significantly worse then it should be. Again I really enjoyed this game but I'd really appreciate it if all the above was fixed. I can't be the only person complaining about this.",
        "The game is not worth the effort anymore, I've lost so many gold credits and cannot accumilate any by watching videos. Everytime I get some on daily login my total remains zero. Bad bad game you should go back to school and learn how to actually program games.",
        "Love this game but having problems now that I have reached region seven. It won't let me access  but once and then it locks me out. That's from the entire game. Freezing and problems with it loading. This bug needs to be addressed asap.",
        "Okay so at first this was a great game. But in the 4th region having to use bows was cool to but here's the catch, your first bow costs 6000 platinum eagles and only earning 2-5 eagles a hunt is down right bs. This doesn't include all the up grading to the bow. Please fix this , either give better rewards or lower the costs. I know there is one OK way to earn eagles but it only works with win streaks with I don't like I like the hunting aspect not the competition. Makes it hard to just sit back and relax. Oh and it's bs during these leagues that you send out more animals marked for the opponent than for yourself ensuring an absolute loss. Fix it or all together drop the league BS.",
        "Excellent game to pass time, only down side are the ads. You want to talk about ads. I've never seen so many ads in a game. Literally every single hunt , which lasts maybe 30 seconds. You have an ad that is 6-30 seconds long. That is highly annoying.",
        "Have some lag during games. I know its for good graphics but. I uninstalled it because of its starting problem. .take so much time to start the game everytime 😑"

        "The upgrades are too expensive, with no other source of income than just selling fishes that takes forever to grow (if they even grow to adult), and watching ads. I tried to make it work for a day but it's super hard to earn money for upgrades. Even watching ads give so little rewards. Uninstalling. So unfortunate because i really loved the PC version of this.",
        "I gave Fish Tycoon 2 4 stars I have spent a lot of time playing this game, BUT, recently the daily rewards and rewards for task completion which include coins do not work.  You complete the task, you are told you are getting $200 added to you bank account, BUT your $ total does not change.  This makes it hard to get money to spend.  All you can do is breed and sell fish - which takes time.  I reported this and got a prompt response that they are sorry and that they were adding $ and Gems  to my account balances.  Nice, but my $ total did not change.  I did see an increase in my gems.  There is an update 2/21/18 hopefully this will improve some issues.",
        "This app is good but need high battery consumption. I hope new upcoming update can reduce battery consumption. For everyone who complaint about money, just relax, breed your discovered expensive fish first and sell it till you have sufficient money. If you have much money you can discover more species freely in order to find magic fish. It's not about speed but it's about passion, strategy, trial error and patient.",

        "I fell in love with these developers when I saw a co-worker playing Virtual Families.  It's so cute!  From there, I got into Virtual Villagers and Fish Tycoon.  This second release is better than the first, but it's still the same basic gameplay.  (tip: Don't buy uncommon eggs too early, or you'll be struggling with too many dying rare fish)"

People should stop complaining, this game is really worth above a 4 star atleast.   No complaints, a well planned strategic game. Have being playing for near 2 years now.",
        "Keeps saying error wen trying to collect alliance gift. Don't like how I put a message on world chat or alliance chat and it still has my same message at the bottom after the fact I had sent it already. This game is way to laggy and needs to be fixed. The graphics can use a bit more work to. The shield ok but would be better if they where a bit more see through and a bit of a sparkle kind of color or something the way it is is kind of funny. There should be a dragon we can use to would be awesome to be able to use hero n a dragon but the armor should actually show on the creator to kind of pointless to use it it's not gonna show on them. Other than that the game is awesome n fun to play.",

        "Not really an action game app. If you like Mafia Wars than this is perfect for you.   UPDATE: Downtown Wars is by far not a bad game. The question is it a game for you. The animation is very limited so if you enjoy action then this is not a game for you. The best way to describe what I noticed after playing game for nearly a week, that it is a long level up game of tag. The comment board is one of the best aspects because you can communicate with the community most important you gang/mob members which helps for team building.",
        "Very interesting and a nice game to pass time, love the BGM! Really like the changeable tags, it's so convenient to change it according to our mood/status and the profile erase option without losing the mob WOW! A really big thumps up to that! It also kinda reminds me of Mob Wars and Extreme Mob Wars etc which got me feeling nostalgic because I was really into it but, DTM tops it all! ;) Forgot to mention this, we can put space in our name! That's so convenient! Cool!",
        "I think Elites should be boosted atleast 100 Points - 20 billion then 1000 Points - 40 Billion is 10x the work for 2x the reward.  A huge change could be game breaking but raising it to 80 Billion would give new players a chance against older players that give their minis huge collects every tourney.",
        "Very good game but it could be better. Like when uv got multiple invites u should be able to accept them all in one instead of one at a time. But that's my only gripe. Apart from that it's a brilliant game much better than the dead imobsters. 1 more thing where can we find the boss iron fist who's attacked me a couple of times but I can't find him to attack him back. How can you recover ur account when uv forgot Google account details.",
        "For me with all the rejuvenation down time, I get bored. But when the favors work,  it becomes a really fun game to keep your mind busy.  But by having multiple games like this it's Kool to toggle  between them. The graphics are great.   My Love for this game comes from the interactive game plot. You have to build networks with fellow gamers to rank.  And likewise building enemies.",
        "Great game. I have played this game for years. It just continues to get better.  Recently in last 24 hours my phone crashed and I got it back up and running. But only when I open this game. Does it say UNABLE TO REACH SERVER. I don't know what's wrong. It won't let me open game at all. Plz fix for me"

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

        "The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says \"combo broken\" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!",
        "I really enjoy this game. Ive maxed out purchases on tracks n cars, modified them all. Now its TOO hard to gain coins to open cars and much exciting tracks.. no updates on additional tracks.. think the optjons should be reviewed. Its now once you get where you are the only way to gain more is to go online to TRY and get coins to get anywhere... which sucks!!!!!",
        "This game won't let me purchase anything. Everytine I start the app I get the \"validation error\" pop-up. I've sent mails to support, left multiple comments but nothing happens. I just get ignored. I am truly over his game with the level of support I am receiving, which is absolutely ZERO!",
        "One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.",
        "I think it should have ALOT more cars. I also think that they should alow custom decals and visual upgrades. Also a better online platform. Like a real time multiplayer. Other then that it's an OK game.  Its not been over a year and...it seems like they update this game every...6-7 months, really bad. Gets reallly boring 🤦🏽\u200d♂️",
        "Love the game! But since the update I'm unable to purchase cars/cash. Every time I open the game it says I need to connect to the internet to make purchases even though I'm connected and can still play multiplayer etc. Any help would be great"

The game is challenging but that is the fun. I played the same game on my smartphone and my tablet and I have been able to conquer all the islands on both. How about another island? When is a new island coming? I scored over 6,000,000 points on the King's castle to end the game. Get a new island, please.",
        "The only problem I have with this game is the need to rely on friends to help you if you run out of money to pay your ransome.  Because if like me you have no friends who play the same games.. This is a problem that needs to thought out or find another way for the player to hook up with other players.",

But then i loaded this up, and didn't even want to finish the tutorial, (which felt never-ending) because I realized this an exact copy of Hobbits Kingdoms, which I stopped because there was never any actual battles, or  motion graphics. And all of those cool CGi characters don't play as shown in the screenshots. Deleted.",
        "In short this is the perfect pocket game. Strategy meets battles and bloodshed. You can play the game how you like, its not like clash of clans where your forced to be hostile, and it gives you a good start. Honestly, i dont understand why people dont like this game however all the bad reports seemed to be from players of the old game....",
        "Love the game. I've been playing since the realeasd of the game before it became Elves Vs Dwarves. They have done an amazing job with this game. Some things could have been better like a majority of my inventory resetting when i rejoined after the game was bought. But overall a wonderful game either way.",
        "Terrible game. In the original hobbit I was an original world 42, back in dec 2012.  Fully maxed 5 cities 100 billion might every hero in every city was min 250 some were 280. Not to mention had couple hundred mithril left in my account Plus 10s of thousands of troops to unbox.. when i went to update game the merged 6 new worlds and im back to level 1.. lmao stupid move on your end. Loyal player here now gone! Was an awesome game i loved it super fun now... seems to be a joke. Duces",
        "It's ok.. I wish they wouldn't have changed the Hobbit into this. It was a good game but I can't get into it now that they changed everything, I guess they \"stole\" or used the Lord of the rings without permission, probably copyright issues so they changed everything.. Now it's pretty lame..",
        "In server 179 one player might still 640m his troops still not cleared he still no 1 in might rank as he is a small player name . latrobio  of NOTORIOUS alliance please fix this. All others T5 troops cleared.he have lots of illigal troops of T5"

I have been wanting a diamond character and now you took it away from me. How can anyone get a diamond level character now. There is no way to purchase them either as they are elite pack exclusive cards. Not very happy. Waiting for this to be fixed until I'm satisfied.",
        "Best game I have played, however after the updates i can't seem to see other game modes like faction wars challenge mode and even quest mode. I have reinstalled a couple of times, I have seen those missing modes in a novice account but whenever I log into my wbaccount they disappear leaving me with normal mode and  the tower mode.",
        "This is so unfair,d last challenge i got was assassin Jade!. I have complained for months now but nothing has been done. It doesnt give me a level playing ground against others. I have missed out on shao khan, tremour, goro and so on. I am feeling left out but dont wanna uninstall. Pls do something",
        "Love the game. Hackers though ruin it, especially in faction wars in hard and fatal battles. For the ones who just updated, faction wars will show up within 12/24 hrs however not sure bout quest mode. Been playing actively for over 2 years, but still don't have All maxed out equipment or all maxed out characters. Hackers have everything maxed out which makes a mockery of our equipment.",
        "I love the game so much, it's fun and gory but I used to play this on my IPhone and I got a new phone and I can't transfer my data even with my Facebook connected to it. My new phone is a galaxy s8 and I wonder if I can transfer my iPhone account to my galaxy. I don't to start over while my other phone have great and exclusive characters. Please help.",
        "I love the game and new update. But i am soo disapointed, that you promissed us Injustice raiden and klassic mileena, still there are no challenges about them. Please make a new challenge a bout those charecters. Also injustice scorpion, undercover cassie cage and others. Please make this right."

        "This is a great game for any Bleach fan   Don't listen to the people who say developers don't care and only want money... this game was originally Japanese and they are transferring it over to English and this takes time.. this game is great the characters look great the game play is very good and even... lvl system is easy n fun and you get what u put into the game. Yes some characters are harder to get then others but that's what makes the game fun and worth playing.. yes the game has a VIP system for those that want to spend money to get better things or characters but that doesn't mean you have to do it to enjoy the game...",
        "I used to love this game but after two app reset wipes, I'm over it sorry going to brave souls who's with me?! Update: after reaching out to the admins on I was able to recover my data from my Google account. The data can not be transferred from ios to Android but that's fine. Thank you admins, sorry for the salt.",
        "Even though the descriptions and dialogues in the game are bit off it doesn't completely take away from the experience of the game. It still does have some bugs, like the dialogues for instance, but the game is really addictive. It's one of very few games that I've been playing religiously for the past few months, probably longer. That's the one of the main reasons why I'm giving 5 *'s. The game has an ENORMOUS amount of potential, I think if the devs got licensing rights then it would improve the game so much more. One thing I really do not like about the game is that it is kind of a pay-to-win game. You have to spend real money to advance quicker or become stronger in the game faster. Other than the cons, it really is a fun and addictive game. If you love anime, if you love fan service, if you love action games, if you just love Bleach in general then you will definitely love this game.",
        "Not very good it fell short of the other apps...it still missing half the content of the others while making it impossible without paying to collect keys.. shard collecting is lacking ...unless you want to pay for anything halfway decernt gameplay you won't find it here",
        "Been playing for the past month. I've had zero issues that I can think of that I've read others having. It's a fun and addicting game. I can't wait for all of the other characters to be added in, only thing I dislike is wanting to play them but they aren't in it. Though I understand why. Great game would certainly recommend.",
        "Only installing because i spent hundreds in the last one. Devs only care about your money, don't fix or take forever to fix issues, and the game is basically pay to win. Yiu can still get decently for free, but don't expect to get to the top that way. Take the 1 star reviews seriously... A lot of ppl stopped playing because of this games BS..."

        "I enjoy playing! Daily Quest could be better. (I don't get the daily magic wheel) But they have events to earn stuff. And I absolutely love my lil pets and their powers 😊 and the ingame friends I have are helpful. edited: I completed a purchase and did not recieve anything like the quest said I would. Also developers never responded to my email regarding something else. I've spent $40 bucks on this game in the 1st few days I've been playing and I think I'll keep my lil money to myself now since they haven't fixed the issue.",
        "Would give 5 stars but after you get to a certain level you have to spend real money to get farther. I have spend 65 dollars on this game so far and have been scammed so many times. Its a super fun game but so hard to get anywhere. You should be able to stock up shields. Also its stupid that you have to pay to talk. I might get the VIP if some things changed.",
        "The problem I have is you haven't given the radio toy for the bear and also you can't unfreeze the guy because you don't give out the items to do it even after defeating the monster. You still can't get enough fire logs plus still no radio toy for the bear? Plus should give more coins it is a lot in higher levels",
        "Losing some snowballs...... Would like to get more than six spins in one hour..... especially when there are large amounts needed to buy..... Mining pigs....really so much when we pay large amounts and our pay is so low.....",
        "I helped my friend defeating leonardo.i used 10 bombs .but when i attacked leonardo .there was still 1 % left .so someone else had complited it.and now i went there to claim reward there was no reward for me.i have not claimed that reward. 2nd thing you have made puzzle number 9 so much rare not even me but everyone is not getting it. Please fix this.i will give 5 stars back.",
        "Loved this game my planet gets distroyed everyday once I almost get it built. I played several times all day. Loved this game. I used to get angels but not any more. Been on same island for weeks. I love building my planet so fun. But not getting distroyed a minutes later. I've noticed alot of my friends stopped playing too due to same problem. 😥"

        "This game has had me hooked for almost two years now. There is always something to work on and improve. For long time Final Fantasy fans, this is the ultimate fanservice. I found this game to be more nostalgic than even other Final Fantasy crossover games like Dissidia and Theatrhythm. My only gripe is that I wish there was some sort of non-battle exploration aspect. A chance to explore the 3d FF games in 2d, even if they were brief and not the whole worlds, would be a nice touch. Highly recommended if you're looking for an addictive combat-focused rpg to devote yourself to, and super recommended for Final Fantasy fans.",
        "Some minor technical issues with hanging or loading forever screens... but overall superb job with the idea, and best part is not needing to gatcha for your fave ff characters. Prob the least p2win of the top mobile games out there",
        "I would rate it a 5, but the problem is that after the 6/8 update, the game ended up being super slow.  Extremely slow that I had to set my battle speed to 1 just to perform a blatant laggy action.  If you fix this issue, then I'll be happy to re-rate it a 5, but for now, you deserve a 3 unless you resolve it.",
        "A fun game that makes you think about playing other Final Fantasy games. I have become invested in various characters and I am interested in Ffiv. The sprites do not work for all characters as it is hard to see differences between characters such as Vayne and Larsa. The game has missed an opportunity to create a storyline to bring the various games together. However it is a fun game that makes you want to play the full range of the Final Fantasy franchise.",
        "I can't remain as positive as I used to be towards the game. With the various app issues such as excessively long loading times, poor performance, and issues with in-app purchases, I have soured on the game as a whole. The lack of daily missions that the japan side of the game received with the FF3 Onion Knight event that we still haven't received reeks of greed and deprives us of about 100 mythril (the in game currency) compared to where we should be.   The game itself, when it runs properly is still excellent. And it is awesome to use your favorite Final Fantasy characters, or become new fans of some. But DeNA has treated the Global version of the game as an afterthought as of late.",
        "I gave this game 5 stars on EVERYTHING! But... I have some criticism. Some of the dungeons are completely too difficult. I've been playing the game for 2 years now DIEHARD and i still can't get even close to beating some of the bosses."

        "Really wanted to love this game. Higham of Futurama. However, when I login I cannot do anything. Game stops as soon as I try to collect from buildings or click on a character. Kinda hard to enjoy a game which crashes every single time in about 2 seconds. I can see from other reviews that I'm not alone. Nice to see tiny Co taking it on board. Edit: not playex for two months, redownloaded expecting them to have fixed by not but nothing has changed. Game still unplayable, Bravo. Really impressed that they can ignore a game breaking bug for so long.",
        "I cant access my character no more glab is stuck in doop hq. Aint been able to use her for a couple of days now so im loosing out. The adds also dnt always load and crash other than that i like the game.",
        "Loved this game and played it everyday while it worked. But ever since the end of the Christmas event the game totally crashes after being on it for only 2 seconds. And none of the updates since then have corrected the issue.",
        "As a huge fan of the show, I would say the game does a decent job staying faithful to the characters, the story, and the recurring gags of the show. Sometimes the ever present monetization of the game can get a little blatant, but the developers seem to learn from their mistakes and have made a really fun game.",
        "Not challenging. Pretty boring. Game play is railroad... Chug chug chug choo choo... Don't even think it developes any sort of adventure or excitement. Graphic start good. Then go 8 bit? Frigging weird.",
        "Some characters like url can't be unlocked unless you go through a specific mission (moon part 4) and in order to go through the mission you need url... You need to finish moon part 4 to unlock the artifact for further expansion for omicron..... This makes no sense, the character can't even be bought.. so it's a dead end for the game, you hit a specific part and the game stops.  Can the developers help with this"

        "Fun game, good story lines, and addictive. I think this is one of my favorite shall we datw games. It's easier to earn the main currency then most of the other games. My only thing I don't nessisarily like is that the story tickets take a while to build back up, although that's kind of a running theme for most of these games and some others take way longer. Over all I enjoy this game.",
        "Fun stories and lovable characters. The only issue is that the amount of jade needed overall for one characters main story is a bit high. I would also like the opportunity to win or use gold/jade to get the side stories. Finally there's almost no point to having gold. The 4 rating is because despite the cost in time and money I still wanted to finish the story. It would be great if we could buy entire main stories.",
        "Please update more stories and events on this! Also, can't you lower the price of tickets? Seems like tickets are more expensive than diamonds. If not lower prices then at least add more tickets like 10 or 15 for 20$? Pretty please! Well either you change it or not I just want to say. I LOVE THEM STORIES ARE DAMN ROMANTIC AND INTERESTING! Love it! Make more event prizes that involves a lot more diamonds and tickets please! THANK YOU LOVE~ | Update: more season 2 of characters please!!!",
        "Addictive, very entertaining stories with good music, colorful graphics, and great characters! My issues with this game is a money dumper! It'll make you spend money to fully complete the stories. In between chapters, you are giving a certain amount of time to complete the mini games or whatever the task may be, which is impossible, in order to receive those special pages.  So it's fun, but there is no way to fully complete stories for free...",
        "I really enjoy the storyline - it doesn't involve too much comedy or anything like that - but it isn't extremely serious either. I love the characters, and I wanna unlock everything possible that involves Ukyo. I do feel that the art for some characters Can be a bit better..(eduard's arm Always being up is a bit awkward). My biggest complaint is that there are many hard to reach checkpoints. But other than that, it's very fun and interesting!",
        "The game is quite good till the part i played but the only problem which i have with this game is after the prologue. After finishing chapter 1 part 1 i can't seem to be able to play the story. It goes completely blank. HURTS !! I couldn't even get a chance to pick my choice ;("

        "Great for passing time, although at times you get kind of stuck where you can't gather any more materials because of storage capacity but then it takes forever to get the items for upgrade. The coin amount to buy some buildings is quite high on a lot of them, and the same with the trees and extra livestock. All in all I love playing this user friendly game!",
        "It has potential to be a great game. Its just so sloooow because you have to spend gems for almost everything. Its hard to get seeds because it's hard to get gems not everyone can afford to spend on these games. The land expansion sucks!!! It takes way to much, can't get what's needed half the time. Easier ways to get seeds and coins and it will be better.... Thanks!",
        "I enjoy this game. It's very addictive but in a good way. I actually just got my wife hooked on playing it as well.   My one question though, why are there so many differences between the Android system version and the IPhone system  version? On each building, my wife can see each item available and what level is needed to unlock it. That doesn't show on mine. Also, on hers, she has a fair/bazaar looking building, a delivery truck, and a hot air balloon thing.  Why are these not on the android version????",
        "Good game,  potential to be great I enjoy most of this game. To make it even better - more tools or the ability to buy them,  I have land I can't use because I can't clear it.  The ability to move trees,  grass, rocks until we are able to clear them, so we can make better use of our land. Better rewards  for completing collections,  I've gotten coins and 1 or 2 shovels.  Not good considering how long it takes to complete & that it says win up to 10 tools!?!  Better fishing,  I only catch catfish,  bass,  and anchovies.",
        "Half my images are invisible. I can't see half of my buildings or the items to craft, crafted items, items on sale or even my stand. I submitted a report to Storm 8 only to be told in a automated reply that they don't have the staff to handle it and there was nothing that would be done. I loved this game and had recently started over, looking forward to playing. Now, once I hit lvl 8, I'm uninstalling.",
        "Farm story 2 This game could be used and enjoyed more but at this time I am not playing as it is more frustrating them fun.  I need to expand the barn and silo but the things needed are a large amounts and RARE to achieve or even buy in the market.  Frustrated with trying to upgrade my barn so I will be taking a break for a while and will see if I return"

I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",

        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?"

        "I love this game one of my biggest issues though as it has a tendency to overheat your tablet or your phone. If it overheats too much then it will start shutting down the game and then can cause issues. I've had where my tablet has gotten the black screen of death and I'm having trouble using it directly in correlation to playing this game because of it overheating. This is something I think really needs to be looked into and see how they can maybe not use so much memory that it affects your tablet or your phone to the point of overheating",
        "Still loves the game when I play. However, I don't understands why the bonus games keep disappearing after I play one round. I have to back out off the app and then restart for the next levels to show up. Pain in the butt. Because this has continued to happen I find myself playing less and less",
        "I have this installed on a newer tablet and have played it for a year and now I can't get it to work.  I also play this on an older tablet that I have been playing for 5 years and plays very well but when I play Elsa creations it does not calculate all that I have matched whether it be one or three.  This part needs to be fixed.  I have watched it not tally what I have matched.  No way to win when it does not work right! I am adding to this post because now frozen free fall does not work at all!  Not sure what happened.  I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it and nothing.  So everything I have played on this game is gone!!",
        "I love this game but its gotten very buggy in the last week. Screens go blank, restarts when making level selection many times over, errored out when buying snowballs, and extra challenged randomly appear and disappear so that the \"days left\" has no meaning. Someone needs to look at this.",
        "Great game that I've been playing for years now, however with the new updates, I can't play past level 1310 because the game freezes as soon as I run out of moves and it tries to reshuffle...and just this morning I can't even play a level without the game restarting over and over again! I can play all the extra bonus games with no issue, it's the regular levels that I can't play...please fix this!",
        "Can't play at all, won't open level or when it does restarts the game! I'm afraid or uninstalling in case I loose my progress.  Pls fix"

        "It's very cool. Aesthetics are perfect. Themes are great. The dungeon itself can be boring. I've played for a couple hours now, and it doesn't seem like I have to do anything to win; the other mercenaries handle it on their own. The menus are overehelming for a beginner. There's too much to see and interact with. It takes some time to understand the Research and Rebirth points. Those need a tutorial",
        "Id just like to say to all of the teams of devs and giant companys that hire psycologists to help them design games... Do what this guy is doing if you want to make a good game. Its addicting and fun for all age ranges.  Im 40yo and have three boys 12 13 and 14 and we all love it. My wife even installed it earlier today to see what the fuss was about and 4 hours later she's still playing. Without a doubt my fav game on android devices.",
        "I truly love this. It's completely old school through and through, which in this case is perfect. I love that the execution is simple, but there is a HUGE amount of choices you can make that will either give your team the edge or hold it back. There are IAP's but you wouldn't know it unless you went looking for them (big plus there). I definitely think this game is worth ig.",
        "This is a brilliant game. As a game design it is perfect to whittle away a long journey. It is easy to pick up and play, there is lots of research to do. The only thing I would say that needs improvement is the pay for features. I understand there is the need to ask for money to help with further development but to restrict some features to be able to only be played in hell mode seems a bit harsh and excludes the casual player from quite a bit of content.",
        "This is a fantastic game for the price and I have enjoyed every minute of it except for the cost to unlock some features of the game. The amount of grinding can be kind of high as well as the cash price if the grind is too unbearable. This is still a lot better than other games though, which is why I rated this to a 5 star after my last review of 4 stars.",
        "Awesome game, i got it for free for the sale but i would gladly have paid the dollar after. Will more than likely buy a pack just to support the dev later on. Tons of play time, modes from easy to hell 15... yeah 18 difficulty settings, with rewards tiering for each one. Will update later when ive played more"

        "It's a great Game. My only issue is there are bullies in the game and you have to always be on to Protect your Fortress and Buoys or they will be destroyed and then you loose everything. Seems everywhere you go there are bullies. And they take forever to do a server merge when you're server is dieing. But overall still a good Game. Also there needs to be a server merge for a few servers. Some of the servers are dieing and some players are quitting because there's nothing new and the targets are slim to none. And alot are written to Joy City and asked for a merger and get nothing. Something needs to be done",

        "Is a scam as I brought a pack for the quest and it wouldn't count towards it but has no info telling people about the problem but Has potential to be a great game but when I wrote to joy city stating the server I play on is pretty much dead and hard to find active people they told me to create a new profile on a new server after putting hours and spending alot on this game they need to sort out there customer care team after being told that it's wrong especially player like me and others who spend money on game and also sort out all these dead servers to make the game exciting again"

        "It's okay, should have more items in the storage bays, it's supposed to be just like a regular storage unit and it's not even close to that. And I believe the other buyers could say different things instead of the same phrases over and over. Maybe y'all can make it a little more realistic.",
        "Good time waster. I bought it just to get rid of the ads. I have a shop now and the game is more fun. Update : they updated the game, but STILL didn't add any new levels! Come on, Devs. Update- new levels finally, but don't know what they are- not enough money to see them!",
        "Fun until you get to Miami.. absolutely impossible to make 100 000.00 to unlock the next level.  Computer outbids or up bids you so that you either give up or lose your money.  No daily incentives to keep brining you back.  Unless you are willing to spend real money for boosters and money to move on.. play to Miami and then delete.. impossible to move forward after that.",
        "The game was addictive and fun until you get to Miami. 100k to unlock that level is absurd and unrealistic. Its to hard to make that kind of money playing and now its just playing the same level over and over trying to get enough. Now its boring!! I'm disappointed, I really enjoyed playing until that point.",
        "Was a great game until I got to Miami level 19 now just bloody stupid & waste of time. I went to 4 straight auctions couldn't buy a unit because competitors bid more than what the units worth how are you suppose to level up & move on when the designers of the game make stupid unrealistic flaws in the game no bidder is going to bid in real life on items they can't see or know are there so why put this into the game? Fix this issue & I will adjust my review accordingly!",
        "Good game. I like the game however  this is the 4th time it has asked me to do a review. I have done this all 4 times with no reward and it still keeps asking me to do  it. Very frustrating"

        "The game is amazing. Really addive, a lot to do including events, dungeons, pvps, afk hunting, auction houses and quests. But i have a couple of suggestions   1) Rather than making VIP players pay 10 dias to use their VIP duels, make it free. We did pay for our VIP or open that benefit at a specific tier.  2) Another VIP benefit that would be nice would be remote auction to shop and fight at the same time lol  Other than that, just fix trade and get rid of the 30 min auction upload lol the game is awesome even without those things.",
        "It's not as pay to win as everyone is saying, yes it's quicker but with normal grinding and combining of lower items you can easily get anything. Vip points are earned in game and don't need to be bought also. Yes the auto quest and kill makes it easy but it's for minimal gameplay later on as you must actually control and move correctly to clear harder content and bosses. It's not like the pc version of it but then again it's an app and I think they did great.",
        "Good game in general . solid contains. looking forward to Rappelz the rift :D when can we expect an early access? Btw for the gender limitation u can probably take exemple from other mmorpg here in the store like OAC or Crusaders of lights as exemple but many can have gender and more customize and classes. Hope to see more in the future but Great Game . keep the hard work 😉",
        "Used to play the original on pc over like ten years ago and loved it. I saw the game in app store and downloaded straight away. Amazing little gane. It is a proper time killer and very easy to get stuck into and understand. It's just a shame there is no shops you can buy equipment from with the soulbound Penya.",
        "Awesome game. But it's just that I really didn't felt it enjoyable I mean I am a Hardcore MMORPG player but this game just didn't felt right. Maybe because i didn't even did much but crossed level 80+ and I didn't have to use my brain on it and didn't did much and got everything easily. Or maybe I'm more into SAOIF type gamer. I don't know. That's why 4star.",
        "Its an ok game but doesn't compare to the real game itself. I'm disappointed with the controls. I have to use the joystick to move around or auto, and it doesn't respond well. It could use some work but not bad. But I did get bored in just 2 days."

        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "It's mindless fun and the soft gore while eating a human is fun. The underwater scenes are visually pleasant. I also like the feature that warps you to the North Pole once a day. The random vortexs that throw you into space are also a really fun feature."

        "It's one of the best basketball games ever in my opinion, but today I had 14 then hit 4 threes while my opponent had 9 then it said my connection lost even though it really shouldn't have and it made my team have 11 POINTS. You need to fix these kind of things.",
        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

        "A game that passes the time but way too many ads. Otherwise mindless fun. I have reached past level 700 and the new update freezes when you win the level and doesn't mark it as a win. You have to back out and start all over only to have it freeze again. Will probably delete it as it's now useless to try to play.",
        "Frustrated.  I was in the 2000+ level and I just got a new phone.  All of my apps got transferred.  Went to bubbles and it started me back at level 1.  I will be disabling.  I can't start over and I spent money for more tokens.  Very angry.",
        "I don't mind ads, but one after every round is excessive, especially when you can't skip them. Perhaps consider only ads you can't skip when requested, like for bonuses and prizes. I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",
        "Enjoyed the different level challenges -having to drop all the balls with fewer of your own. Do get fed up with adverts at times. One or two won't clear screen and have to shut down game to resume playing",
        "One of the best bubble/ball shooter games. And yes very addictive.  Only 2 negatives... bubble at the bottom unable to move to the left or right as in another favorite game. Secondly there is a creepy ad or something dark that pops up periodically between games.",
        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?"

        "Improved in many ways, but you'll most likely need platinum turtles to earn Super Shredder DNA.  He is faster than a level 71 Splinter and he cheats. He uses all abilities with 0 cool down time, he keeps getting armor, shield, and healing... making winning impossible, unless you are +20 levels higher than him.",
        "It's a fun, easy, addictive game. My ONLY complaint is that even when you buy a card, you don't get to CHOOSE which Character you are getting. If I'm paying $100 for something, I better get to PICK what I'm getting - this game doesn't let you do that.  I also think it takes WAY TOO LONG to evolve Characters, and overall the add-ons are FAR TOO EXPENSIVE for what you are getting, but you don't HAVE TO spend money if you don't want to.",
        "The game is a great game, I love how they added characters from all eras, it sorta reminds me of turtles in time. The only huge downfall of this game is that it's pretty much a pay to play game smh. I've never seen a game that is so money hungry in my life. The $10 monthly subscription  is absurd, the SFX ingame dont work and for 5 bucks more you can play Elder scrolls online that has a ton of content compare to this game.",
        "Subscription should come with better benefits. $10 a month...6 months worth I could've bought an xbox game. Ya know. Pizza re-gen should be a bit quicker. Some people like to grind. And the pizza limitation kills the grind. Good graphics tho, and great characters. But waaaay to hard to acquire the turtles. Big let down on that aspect",
        "Great game just wished Very amazing game especially if you are a turtles fan.. lots of choices with characters.. you can definitely get stronger without having to pay.. you just need to put in the time , and do  do daily event's.. i wish some characters were easier to get;))",
        "After a long battle with the worst customer service i have ever dealt with i will regrettably no longer be playing this game. The game itself is pretty solid but is a money sink. If you need help from the company you may as well quit. The game is a solid 4/5 but the company's attitude and considering you being disposable sadly makes them a 1/10"

        "Used to be fun but now all about $$$ I have been playing  this game for a long time and it has been one of my favorite games, but recently playmage has been more concerned about money and is ruining  the game. We used to be able to purchase potions in guild shop for reasonable  amount but that has changed because the game administration wants more money. This makes me sad because many long time players are leaving  the game. New players will never know just how fun this game once was. :-(",
        "Can't turn the crappy music off. You can only turn it down but you can still hear the horrible stuff. I couldn't stand it long enough to even figure out how to play the game. Uninstalling.",
        "Garbage. Played the game for 3 years, used to be one of my favorites. Then it turned into a cash-sucking piece of crap overnight with one update. I have never felt betrayed by a game developer prior to this, but Playmage introduced me to the feeling, and it's a strong hatred. I will never deal with them again. Avoid.",
        "Great game If you persevere you can great cards without spending lots of cash, good combo of skill and luck. Is disappointing they doubled price on revives and energy.",
        "This game was fun and now over time the game is slow and with no changes in sight.  What ever you do don't spend your $$ you gain nothing but pain for you because you got nothing to show for it.",
        "This game is joke pay real money for cards then they nerf them... and they weren't cheap! Don't waste your time or money!!!"

        "Not a bad game, don't need money really to level up and get to a good standing against others. It goes pretty quick till level 65ish  and starts to slow down. If you want to spend money it helps speed leveling and getting your guys up stronger faster obviously. If you have patience and don't mind not leveling to fast, or just taking your time in general this game is for you. Lots to do. My favorite part is trying to find a way to make my team the strongest I can, using the massively different combos of hero's u can use and all the things you can add to them to make them stronger. You can literally go with a 1 man team or a 5 man team based on materials u have to equip them with to make sure they can last in battle. Have fun and good luck all... Been playing for 100 days now, game is getting better players  wise, support  wise not so hot.. they only get back to you when they feel like it I guess, there was a problem I had like a month ago they kinda jumped on right away. But I messaged them a few days ago and they have yet to reply... Gonna drop the stars due to this. Love the game tho, be better to your players developers..",

It is silly to invest an hour into exploring only to lose it all because of an extra click, especially when you have a bunch of telaports. When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",

Fix your game! It's no fun. I am a great backgammon player, and I know that my skill level does not match this crazy rules of the dice! Also, when I finally make five or six thousand points, the game seems to always choose a board that costs me $5,000 chips even though I did not click on that particular board! It happens every time. And I lose all my 5,000 chips that I've taken so long to earn! This game sucks!"

        "More and more focus on pay to win and the 4th weapon, the distance weapon makes it too complex and disturbing. In particular the boomerangs because there are almost no chances to avoid a hit. In unequal battles the inferior just got an extra disadvantage --&gt; no David vs goliath anymore possible. It sucks",
        "At first look it didn't mesmerise me, but after 2-3 matches I feel in love with it! It is awesome and has tons of weapons and other stuffs. The multiplayer option is also great and chest opening is such a treat. One worry is that the weapon below the primary weapon is still locked (why I don't know), otherwise the game is superb. Graphics are top notch and fighting doesn't come more realistic than that!",
        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "Good overall, although I have some gripes about the stunlocking when you're ragdolled on the ground and you can't recover. Also, at the fight with Xiang Tzu in the tournament, after I win the game blurs to blue as it is supposed to, but just stay there and doesn't show my rewards. When I restart the app the game then resets me to before I fought Xiang Tzu.",
        "I have been playing this game for past few months and i just love the game. Its so addictive but today when i updated it, it has become a nuisance. Every time i defeat a opponent in a mission the game halts after \"you win\". I tried this with other missions as well but things didn't work. Please fix this bug.",
        "After update to chapter 4, when I played the campaign, after I win it just hang. Try to play the side quest (enemy must be drunk to lose health) but after I win, the game just hang. I'm on Note8 so it won't be device problem for sure and the game runs smoothly until update to chapter 4. And plus I lost 1 EPIC CHEST!! Give them back to me! Arrgghhhh this is so frustrating! Please fix this! I really love this game!"

        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

        "Good app but few glitches. One day I was playing against computer. It made a miraculous move of eating my pawn at a place where none of my pawn ever existed. Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on..",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "The last update sucks! Premove is not at all intuitive. It now just shows the block which we want to move the pawn and doesn't move the pawn itself like before. The toast message that showed 'challenge rejected' was better than the current one. Dislike it!!",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team."

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game."

        "This has a lot of potential. Connection issues are horrendous after this last update. Also, add a help section that explains what everything means. Lots of stats, numbers, ratings, etc. that we have to figure out on our own. Another thing, stopped receiving notifications after updating to Oreo.",
        "Overall it's pretty fun and addicting.  My only real issue came up with today's update. My 40-rated team got matched to play against a 60-rated team in my first Challenge game. wut",
        "The game was great until the update. Took my team from a 43 to a 41. Put alot of time into it, hope this gets worked out. They also nerfed training. Don't even bother wasting 15 coins on an extra session.",
        "Update: ***500 coins for ~350k in game cash isnt even 1 rookie signing.... you can get 3 star players for that kind of coin. **** the latest updates have added cool new features like the coach analysis, fewer bugs and more consistency. The coach analysis function could be cool but every description is \"this player is making great progress, keep pushing him!\" Even for aging players who are getting worse as the seasons progress. It does however project where the player could trend stats wise.  Still no goalie stats. Still no trade options (not sure how that would wotk) but they added refunds to contracts you release from your roster which depend on the player and their contract value,  time remaining etc...  Would be cool to also be able to make in game adjustments, like if your star goalie is letting goal after goal slip through swapping goal tenders would be nice otherwise there doesn't really seem to be a point in having 2 goalies even on the roster.  Overall it's a Fun game with a LOT of potential, if you're a fan of hockey you should definitely give this a try. Would like to see some of these things as the game develops",
        "Please fix how it automatically signs a new player if you don't renew a contract.. the purpose is to dump cap space and it signs some random player and then won't let me release him.  Also STOP changing my line ups. At any point any time ever. There's no need to change it or else you night as well play the game for me. I spend alot of time re doing them and then next thing I know every thing is changed. Not sure why or what causes it buy it is annoying as hell",
        "Overall it is a decent game. However finding an opponent for the games especially the rank games sucks. Either you get another player who is far superior to you or another who is far below your level. It needs to be more equal to be fun."

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

        "This game is so old school and gta 5 is so much better than this game but it is still worth playing. It has a lot of cheats and hacks but it is still very good. It plays up very x1000000 rare. This game is very fun and if you have seen my comment please download this game immediately because it's extremely fun and it is very easy to collect money ps its okay to play offline and if you have seen my comment i recommend you to download this game immediately and have a great time",
        "I loved this game wh3n I was young and this brings back the best memories of my child hood haha.. the controls are kinda lumpy when steering a vehicle. But all other movements are pretty good. Butt,if you happen to have a Xbox one s controller it works perfect on my galaxy s8 plus. Thanks for porting this game to android and giving the option to max the graphics out. Looks very good! Loving the portal game feel too haha!",
        "Just started, i am playing with an Xbox One controller and everything works perfect.  The only problem is you are stuck with the original controls and cant change the buttons functions.  I wish i could use the triggers for gas and braking for driving the cars like in GTA's 4 and 5.  Other than that everything is good.  A classic game, that runs smoothly, and is a great time nostalgia trip.   This one works so well that i am definitley buying the other ports as soon as i am done with this one.",
        "Game could be grate Game looks awesome but the controls don't work right. Walking and running is not fluid. It's stop and go. While driving it is very hard to steer while pressing the gas pedal. I have Max Payne and the controls in that are great what happened with GTA San Andreas. Please fix. Also could you make it so I can move the game to my SD Card. I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 4.",
        "Guys help please! i gave the game 5 stars because i like it so much. But there's a probleme that im facing now when changed devices i had all my data saved on a samsung alpha device, now i reinstalled the game on my new samsung s6 edge and i loged in, and there was no cloud save. Please help me find a way to fix this! Thank you"

When swiping it doesn't always read the swipe and kick it for a try through ball. When shooting the swipe isn't constant, I can swipe as fast as i can and it goes 54mph. Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue.

You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",

        "It's fun, but I can't play it once I get to the mist part in section 1-2, the game freezes but the music keeps playing... If the devs make an update that fixes this, I'll play, but until then, since I can't play it properly, it's off my phone. Sorry devs, it's amazing but I can't play it right now",
        "The characters look amazing! I haven't got any legendaries yet. Very fun and challenging! One complaint is that in breakout mode, you have to start roght from the beginning. Regardless, it's great!!",
        "Can you pls put in a feature to migrate the data from Line Cookie Run? Line Cookie Run is closing down soon but I have so much memories collecting my cookies and treasures and I already had so much! To lose everything is making me a little heartbroken :'(",

        "I'm a bit reluctant at first trying this new CookieRun from the previous LINE version, but I regret it, I should have play this sooner. Everything is so addicting with new system and better music and graphics as well, awesome!"

The graphics are amazing no flaws there and as a new player right now the newcomer rewards are so helpful.",
        "Customer service is a joke. The game is pretty simple to play, once you get the hang of it. But don't join the game until they bring out a new server, impossible to complete with long time playing players unless you're willing to spend a hell of a lot of money to catch up. Current two servers I play on are pretty dead due to this.",
        "It's been more than a year and com2us haven't fixed the boss raid glitches: disconnections and boss doesn't take damages. Though they will have new costumes and useless mons coming out regularly.",
        "This game have the worst browser in this planet,how much time i need to reload the event page until i can read it?? Unstable server perform,, I still can play moba and pubg while i got dc hundred times in this game,, How long this server game will be better?? I play from 2015,2015-2016 the server is still good",
        "At last, I got a reason to get rid of this game. the latest update was taking veeeeery long. This game has its good points but not so fair. Not really practical, PAY to win game."

        "Sorry to say, but in terms of balance it is the worst game I have played so far. This game is the most unbalanced game, even for beginners. Currently I have 4 heroes and the funny part is that all four are weak against defense, such as a cannon, a rail gun, 2 stars for the full upgrade. Even high level players can attack on beginners. Defence is too much high for the attacking players, against 2 heros unit and I've noticed that lower level players can not overcome my defence while high-level players pass easily. This game is good and entertaining, there is not much flaw in this game, but this game is very unbalanced and unfair. Many players have complained about this.",

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "Not really an action game app. If you like Mafia Wars than this is perfect for you.   UPDATE: Downtown Wars is by far not a bad game. The question is it a game for you. The animation is very limited so if you enjoy action then this is not a game for you. The best way to describe what I noticed after playing game for nearly a week, that it is a long level up game of tag. The comment board is one of the best aspects because you can communicate with the community most important you gang/mob members which helps for team building.",
        "Very interesting and a nice game to pass time, love the BGM! Really like the changeable tags, it's so convenient to change it according to our mood/status and the profile erase option without losing the mob WOW! A really big thumps up to that! It also kinda reminds me of Mob Wars and Extreme Mob Wars etc which got me feeling nostalgic because I was really into it but, DTM tops it all! ;) Forgot to mention this, we can put space in our name! That's so convenient! Cool!",
        "I think Elites should be boosted atleast 100 Points - 20 billion then 1000 Points - 40 Billion is 10x the work for 2x the reward.  A huge change could be game breaking but raising it to 80 Billion would give new players a chance against older players that give their minis huge collects every tourney.",
        "Very good game but it could be better. Like when uv got multiple invites u should be able to accept them all in one instead of one at a time. But that's my only gripe. Apart from that it's a brilliant game much better than the dead imobsters. 1 more thing where can we find the boss iron fist who's attacked me a couple of times but I can't find him to attack him back. How can you recover ur account when uv forgot Google account details.",
        "For me with all the rejuvenation down time, I get bored. But when the favors work,  it becomes a really fun game to keep your mind busy.  But by having multiple games like this it's Kool to toggle  between them. The graphics are great.   My Love for this game comes from the interactive game plot. You have to build networks with fellow gamers to rank.  And likewise building enemies.",
        "Great game. I have played this game for years. It just continues to get better.  Recently in last 24 hours my phone crashed and I got it back up and running. But only when I open this game. Does it say UNABLE TO REACH SERVER. I don't know what's wrong. It won't let me open game at all. Plz fix for me"

        "I really love this game, you get rewarded for prioritizing property and it's very satisfying to finish the level with a perfect score when you time everything just right. The diamonds are a little bit too rare to get and since half the updates are priced with diamonds the end result is each location doesn't get 100% upgraded, witch is a little bit frustrating. I love that when you revisit a level it's slightly different, makes it much more interesting. It's a lovely little game, kudos to the developers and designers!",
        "1. This should have an UNLIMITED LIVES option. The stages per level are unenjoyably difficult enough --why do you have to limit the player's chance to try and be better?? Some levels are impossible for human fingers already.  2. You should lessen the required number of diamonds as value of items to upgrade!!! A player only gets 9 diamonds per level achieved. 10 gems per upgrade is ok, but 50??? FIX THIS ASAP or people will be deleting this app.",
        "I love it cuz it's the best but some of the costumers are feisty. The old lady takes three the man and boy takes two things. The young lady is fine. She takes 1 stuff. The little girl I hate her. She rides her scooter in the shop when she know full well she post to ride her scooter outside. But everything else is okay.",
        "I always love supermarket mania. I played supermarket mania 1 and 2 and expect great things for this. But, no, this game infuriates me. The pace is really slow and the customer stream is to long. More over, it use diamonds for essential upgrades like cashier (why should i upgrade cashier??) and cart. Grinding diamonds is a pain in the ass. I think the developer only think of making money than make this game enjoyable to it's player.",
        "I like this game but it needs to give better options earn Crystal's and it should not cost you as many if any at all to move to next level. I play a lot of games and don't mind spending a few dollars but now I'm turned off from it. Yall need to do better. I Won't suggest it to any of my friends for that reason alone.",
        "I really have fun with this game. I also like how you can earn the crystals through playing, not absolutely having to pay. One thing that would be nice was to have the option to fast forward especially with times when you're just waiting for customers or the elderly ladies to finish shopping. Also an endless challenging round would be awesome. Thanks =)"

        "Enjoyed the game. Very fun and im actually spending which is rare for me.   I dont like the orb prices go up with each new arena. I wont be spending now im in in arena 4 those prices are just not worth it. Id also like the ability to save a few different decks. And make gold earning a bit easier its not balanced. Im in arena 4 and been saving gold for over a week not spending on anything opening orbs. And i still cant upgrade any of my cards.   Tbh as much as i enjoy the game. If i cant upgrade without spendig then ill wind up uninstalling eventually",
        "Love it! Very interesting and fun to play, but i have a suggestion. You should add some spells (Poison, Heal...). They don't have to be overpowered, just for slightly more fun gameplay! Also they should be regular cards (Heroes). And one more thing: bring some advatage to players that don't start first in the match, because it's easier to win when you are playing first.",
        "Very unique and fun strategy game. Easy to understand from the first game. Very forgiving to newcomers but if you want to get good, it takes planning and learning. Fun to pick up and play throughout the day. My only problem is that if you sit and play for more than a few minutes, you'll waste alot of orbs winning games. You can spend gems to free up slots, but I'd rather just not receive orbs until I have a free slot. Good game.",
        "I wish that your global rank was more intuitive and less complicated to acquire. Also on the achievement's it says that I can't get the last 2 stars on the found heroes however I have all that I can get. I also wish there was a pm option as the leader of a clan I want to give constructive criticism but not call them out in the chat.. other than that it fully deserved the 5 star.. thanks for makeing this and keep smashing!!😋",
        "The game itself its good, but lack of fun. To upgrade cards you need money which is hard to get in the game and from the clan. In free chest and common orbs you never get any rare cards and money is too less. Would be fun if the cards could be developed faster and if they would have a counter attack possibility when you upgrade it to certain level. You could implement a coop when each plyer choose 2 cards from deck or something similar. In addition I would change which player starts, should be based on the deck strenght. I would also implement the position of the cards on the field and which card is in front and which card in the back, by that you need to start a bit more strategic. Hope that something happens with the gameplay soon, before more players leave. Good luck",
        "Love the game. Really fun to play and balanced so even non paying players can do well. One complaint I have is the new addition of zombie has a bug, when hitting a buffed opponent the poison touch doesnt replace the buff. Please fix this issue."

        "Great game!!! Still some bug's. You have to log out and log back in to collect the 5 hour daily rewards. Sometimes you can't post in the chat rooms. It will say invalid character. A lot of lag at times when you use the power and impact gauge. There needs to be more options to customize character's and or add more. I also believe the daily 5 hour rewards need to change instead of the same rewards everyday. It is a fun game, and highly addictive. Great graphics, which still could be improved on, looking at newer golf games coming out.",
        "Great game.  Only problem is the huge 10 second warning that covers your shot.   Also the game meter jumps.  So I get penalties for taking longer than 10 seconds when I let the control bar reset.",
        "Almost great. The UI is a crowded mess. Too much nonsense. The equipment tabs are broken due to bugs(I downloaded on several devices) making it impossible to accurately navigate between items, and the putting is rigged(obvious padding) resulting in missed shots that shouldn't happen. Besides these glaring flaws there is great potential here.",
        "A great game easy to play and progress.  Only issue is i can't work out how to change my country from the usa to aus. Sick to death of my putts begging taken off me because you have ridiculously stupid gamer play.  If I putt a ball in real life and it hits the edge of a cup it goes in 90 pc of the time.  If I putt one to the lip of the cup in real life it goes ohm.  But bout your retarded physics.  They stop the ball on the edge or knock it away from the hole. What a load of bulls$/^. Fix this and I may consider upping the rating",
        "I really like this game other than the BIRDS IN THE BACKGROUND!!! Shut them up PLEASE!!! It's very annoying and makes me not want to play this game I have to play it with the volume turned down so I don't have to hear the freaking BIRDS!",
        "Fine before the update. Now it glitches and freezes. Cannot finish a round. Power bar no longer smooth. Not enjoyable to play. I wanted to quit in the middle of the round. Very disappointed in latest update. I hope this is fixed soon. This was my favorite game on mobile device ever and I want to go babe to playing it!"

        "I do miss the old LOA - Fire Raider style of art and play, just came back after maybe a year or so and it was gone! But, Paradise seems pretty cool so far, only thing I'm not a big fan of is how everything deals with irl money while in the 'old' one you could build up gems or materials for certain things like VIP levels; also I heard about rewards being given to old players like me? That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",
        "Gave you people an opportunity to fix the stupid chibi icon characters. The latest update didn't fix that so uninstalled.  Also do not reply with a generic response cause you can kiss my ass",
        "Only challenging for nonpaying playing. Not a big fan of pay to win games. But LoA is always addicting and just makes you want to spend your money. Not suitable if you're addicted to that overall. More nonpaying support would be reasonable for them to at least be able to compete.",
        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",

It's not my network so don't say it's my network.. I tried restarting the game that only makes it worst I really want to play this game."

No explanations on some features, you have to figure it out by trial and error wasting resources. I'm at castle level 15, dragon level makes no difference so far only troop level does. Events are useless because the top spenders take everything before you can even find the location. Misleading descriptions in-game costing you resources. This is utter BS and far from anything tactical as advertised. Drains battery faster than any app/game I've ever encountered",

Also improve tha game's matchmaking skills",

So, to publisher is not enough income of adds on game worth of 2$, but have in-game purchace worth of HUNDRED of dollars. Really? On a casual kid's game? Greed to infinity and beyond.",

        "Great Game and concept and all... But the multiplayer is so offballanced. I'm only like level 3 and yet I keep getting people who are at least level 80. Also the new zombie hero (Huge-Giganticus) needs to be nerfed as soon as possible. Lastly, whoever makes the daily challenges needs to stop, they are practically impossible to beat and the reward isn't that great.",

Moreover, players who had issues about the internet connectivity problems of while they're watching an ad and letting your opponent to win in multiplayer. Not only that but the Super Block Meter is keeping a lot buggy. Fix these problems now."

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "I'm a sports junkie so of course this game drew my attention. Wasn't sure about the gameplay at first, but I like this game enough to play everyday. I actually have some decent ideas for this game that could put it over the top. If the app developers actually read this review then you should contact me. I have ideas that would make this game have an even broader spectrum in the marketplace, reaching not only sports nuts like myself, but gamers in general.",
        "I like the plays, plus you can put it on auto and watch it if you get tired. Just one problem. Your Dev people need to look into this: I thought if the spinner landed in the bright green, your play would go the yards it was supposed to. If it landed in the dark green, your play would gain a few more yards. Now the bad stuff. If the spinner landed in the bright red, your play and your opponent's play would fail and if it landed in the dark red, the ball was either fumbled or intercepted, depending upon the play. That's what happens to me, but not to my opponent. Many times when the spinner goes to the red, between the 40 yard line and the goal line, he will spin, and the spinner landed in the red. He will get a touchdown. His play was supposed to fail.",
        "I love this game alot but it's getting annoying now. I had to restart bc I lost my other game but my team is about 80points good. I just lost to a team that has 40. I find that sad. My team is way better. Not the first time bc I've lost to a 40,46,50,63,75. Please make it harder for teams that are low beat a time higher then them. Make it more challenging for teams that are lower",
        "I like the game overall but the clock management is really bad. Like 40 seconds for a play? At least add timeouts or make the plays not waste so much time. Also yall should add playoffs for the season, not jus win win win and win. It should be more competitive in the season mode and not just winning cause it gets boring. That's what I suggest but overall the game is good . Pls reply and make a huge update . :)",
        "Are you kidding me. Blitz doesnt help against the run. It absolutly does. And you are seriously telling me that i cant make 10 passing plays in a row. I absolutly can in real life. So unrealistic.",
        "Other than you can't see a lot of the plays it's a really good game. But one thing .you guys should put more indept into the game by letting us see more plays .instead of only the plays that counts. I myself want to see indept plays. But other than that. It a great game"
