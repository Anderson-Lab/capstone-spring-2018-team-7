        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

Just my logical opinion having to see my sister suffer with addiction for the last 14 years. But, you guys have fun being addicted.",

        "I am really disappointed that it takes so much to upgrade each time is insane. I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!",
        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",

UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio.",
        "Great Game! Really captures that what made SIMS fun and for mobile on the go at that! Graphics are reasonable considering it is new. When building houses the only drawback is you cant construct walls within a room, you have to work with box rooms. As well as you cant make like a out door patio without it being in a room enclosure.  All in all though I do highly recommend this game to you if youve enjoyed SIMS games in the past. Loads to do,events and updates to keep you busy for awhile."

Unfortunately, i have one issue i can't access the chat room, no messages, cant access mh own profile. It keeps saying network error even though i am currently playing the game smoothly. If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",
        "If you put gold army in your garrison troops its impossible to invade you even the attacker is highest level. Attacking castle is very costly you need to attack many times for few resources. The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",

Not the first time I have ran into this problem.  Please help me fix this.  I have cleared the game data uninstalled and all that nonsense.",

        "First off to all those saying too many ads, there aren't any ads. What you're seeing is game packs that can be purchased to help you advance within the game. I love the game. Everythingis great. I just wish they would give everyone time to adjust to previous items before creating something new. And also the pricingis too high. $20-$50 is fine but $99 is way too much.",
        "This game has become a cash cow for the developers at MZ. New features are added making the game more complex and diverse weekly. Costing players money. While old features players are familiar with and depend on break down  After contacting MZ you get a nice form letter stating thank you for bringing it to there attention but they hope you understand these things take time to fix.",
        "This game should be awesome, but the updates just come too fast now. I bought 2 packs this week and still got zeroed as soon as i dropped shield. By the time you spend 2 days clicking upgrades, someone is stronger than you and just waiting for you to try to use your new stuff.",
        "This game was fun about two years ago before MZ started trying to milk players each month for money.  If you buy a package from them,  which ranges from $14.99 to $399.99, make sure you get what you pay for. ..many times you don't get everything they promise; especially with the BOGO packages.   MZ will do little if anything to correct the matter.  Also, even after you spend tons of money, if you wait long enough they will give you the same stuff for free to all players.   My advice...find another game to play. ..something more fun and worthwhile. ..and not sponsored by MZ.",
        "If you want to be at top of this game then be prepared to spend more than the price of a top end BMW in one year. I am not kidding. MZ releases major game changing upgrades every day for several $99.99 packs. Then you get tge worst customer support in the industry. Terrible software quality control and business practices that mirror drug cartels.",
        "Mz took a once decent game and ruined it.  The weekly changes are senseless change is to be gradual.  Im finally walking away.  Im done with ur bots, done with admin accts and done with daily chances.  More and more people have quit and droves more will follow.  Choke on the money u got from all  of the foolish people who actually paid.  You deserve none of it"

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "I just started the game a couple of days ago, but I'm already hooked.  Like most games, you kind of learn as you move along, but a little more guiding would be very helpful. Thanks for making a fun game! I am having a problem getting past the loading screen though. I tried clearing cache, forced stop, delete files, even uninstalling and reinstalling again.",
        "Easy to learn with loads of variables to keep it interesting. Graphics are stellar. As with most 'free' games, there are lots of incentives for you to get out your wallet; if you're as unwilling to do so as I am, you'll have to be patient. Can't fault the developers. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though",
        "I don't mind spending money on micro transactions if I like the game, and I do like this game.  But the jems in this game are outrageous, if you wanted to buy jems to buy one ship it would cost you $10-$20, depending on the ship.  Because of this, this developer won't be getting any more than the $4 I've spent on it unless they lower their prices."

        "Overall game is very good n addictive, been playing the game for awhile now. 1 major issue of the game is bugs that cause the game to lag esspecially after every game update. Reali hope Pocket Gems will look into this matter seriously and build a better game foundation. I will review my ratings when the game is more stable.",
        "LOVE THIS GAME!! unlike other timed games you don't have to wait around.  When things are upgrading you can literally spend hours if you want just attacking other bases and breeding dragons.  Graphics are amazing and this is one game that constantly has me coming back.",
        "Wonderful game, all these pay to win comments are slightly misleading. There are several power ups and time reducers that come fairly easy if you participate in events. Which, the events are almost always going on so you don't get bored!  Only problem I have is that the app keeps uninstalling itself from my phone. Not sure if it's the app's fault or my phone, but it doesn't happen to any other app on my phone...",
        "PG needs to fix a lot of stuff. They never listen to the community and with the Atlas update has destroyed many alliances by creating a class divide between teams of all ranks. Huge let down and am afraid of the future of the game when game design decisions like this are allowed to occur.",
        "Fun until you have to wait a day to do something. How can you play a game if the game won't let you play, but by good it takes up space. So you want me to have a game taking up space in my phone but I'm can't play the game. So it is literally a waste of space.. developers are stupid and selfish."

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",

I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)"

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and addicting, with patience.  My only complaint is that everytime i die,  which is often,  i lose all my stuff and can never find my body again.  I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",
        "WARNING: every time you update the game, it cannot connect to your google play account for god knows how many hours or even days! The risk of losing all your progress is VERY high. If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",
        "I love the game. But seriously? You get 1 energy every 5 minutes and at minimum need 13 energy to get somewhere... Also why do you stop letting us watch ads? It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",
        "check out my review from yesterday and their reply. for an investment you can develop faster, which means spend money. that's all you care about. I've been a loyal player from the very beginning and that's their response. I'll post a message on Facebook everyday and see how many people keep playing your game or even start playing it. lol. isn't it funny how they only have gameplay graphics and controls that you can see the rating for and not how happy users are. download war z law of survival. that game is much better and the developers actually listen to the people playing."

        "It's a good bingo game with a good amount of variety. Love the fact that you can play in different rooms and get bonuses with the puzzles! I was wondering if buying the elite pack is a one time purchase or a monthly fee. Couldn't find the answer anywhere. One tip to make it even better would be to make the tickets a little easier to get. Otherwise would give 5 stars!",
        "My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)",
        "The game itself is very fun.  However, if you run out of tickets, it is way too difficult to earn more.  Apparently, they made it easier to earn tickets but after playing many other games, the update isn't enough.  To continue playing, you must buy tickets.  I may have to delete the game which is a shame because it really is a fun game.    3/18/18... They tell you to play lower cost games to get more rewards but it doesn't.  It just takes you a bit longer to go through your tickets but you don't win anything.  Time to delete.  Graphics were great and games were fun but without tickets you can't play.",
        "Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win",
        "It's been nice...I'm happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you \"Dataverse\", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can't spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck",
        "I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that's  called cause usually that's the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can't  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I'm  sure it does others as well."

Im trying my best to play this game that i loved and win some good characters but why is it everytime in road to glory there is a network issue well in fact in other game modes there is none. PLEASE FIX THIS NET ISSUE WERE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO WIN BUT ENDED UP LOSING BECAUSE OF THE NET ISSUE. . Thanks. I love this game so much so please be fair.",
        "Women's Royal Rumble. Generous fair ads mid way between limited and unlimited leading to competitiveness going back to it. So much better than old s4 and it's only day 1. Can't talk about heroic yet haven't got one but sounds good too.",
        "Love the app and the game it is very addictive. I love the changes to season 4; however your ticket store and CP PVP store is still bugged as I am still getting cards well below my rank. Also PVP is very buggy as I am always seeing waiting for opponent or opponent is viewing last match which isn't an option. Just wondering if there is a security team that monitors online activity because it seems like a lot of people are manipulating the network at times.",
        "I like the game but last week 2 of my cards where removed I didn't accidentally delete them. They was locked. I emailed and got told that there was nothing they can do. It is a Titan pro Neville and a beast pro Tamina can someone help me get my cards back I played a lot of games to pro them right",
        "Horrible, disgusting excuse for customer service I have ever seen. Automated response no matter the issue. Never a problem ( and there are many many many issues.) Do not let the WWE license fool you, this is NOT a company I would support and I'm not sure why WWE can't find another company to produce a game.like this.",
        "They are still plagued by PVP issues that they claim they are fixing, but never do anything about. Not worth playing as you won't actually recieve your rewards for playing, and they won't help you if you send in a help ticket. You will only get form letter responses. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."

I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",

It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",

That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",

I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

        "It's pay to win for sure. However, if you play daily and stick to monthly and quarterly cards you'll rack up gems and heroes quickly. It took me over a year to get my VIP high enough to get the monthly meta heroes. I get an hour or two a day out of it and even when I didn't have the monthly paid heroes I had a fun time. I don't mind spending $15/month for the amount of time the game helps me kill.",
        "I'm a paying customer, which they call \"VIP\" but you best believe you are far from important. I had an issue with a purchase in December, but support takes a week per message to reply and isn't useful at all about the issue and tells you they can't help. Should have let Google refund the money before the 48 hours instead of giving their support a chance.",
        "Don't download the game . If u want to win u must spend thousands dollars. A huge skins with control every month 2 new heroes with amazing power. Every month making new heroes and the old ones getting trash. Random game no strategy. Just click for pic. Ucool don't do anything. Don't download!!! I played more than one year and every month it's getting worst. The forgetting about players. They think only for cash. Ucool one of the worst organisation..if u don't spend a money please don't start the game .nice pictures  and that it )))",
        "This game was a very well balanced game between free play gamers and those that put money into it. Not anymore. If you want to be competitive you must put handreds of dollars each month (no joke). Very dissapointed in the way this game has become.",
        "A very good game but a pay to win. I myself paid 73$ and I am VIP 8. This game can be fun without paying but to get the most out of it atleast  buy an annual card for 30$. If you have even more to throw away try buying all the cards when they run out get a new one. (Mainly Annual and Season Card. Week card isn't a must have). Also if you are new to the game wait for a new server to start. That way you wont fall behind. I am on server 210 and have also played on server 207. I was in this game when it was brand new and purple heroes were the best. I was in 1 of the 1st servers and f2P I quit the game at lvl 50 though. All in All if you want to play this game prepare 100$",
        "The menu is very unresponsive when scrolling. Also, when killing enemies, particularly after using a special ability, the enemy simply freezes and then fades away - there's no animation for the death of the enemy and this is disappointing and detracts from the immersion. Otherwise it's a good game, but significantly more heroes would be necessary to keep me interested."

        "It's a fun twist on the match-3 concept and a nice shift from the original Farm Heroes.  I wish you could earn gold bars instead of only being able to buy them.  Why not through the Country Show?  I'd rather earn gold bars than the unusable and irrelevant  coins and trophies.",
        "Very frustrating at times but for the rest it all good. Well I needed to add level 777 was the killer for me. I guess it's time to find a new game to play. Just wanted to share.",

        "This game is amazing a full on batlle with strategic ways to beat your opponent. The only thing im concern with is not seeing much to do in an alliance than donating troops. I would like to see a way were you can team battle and get awards but other than that its a five star game",
        "This game is amazing! But enemy units keep getting stuck behind walls Also there are a few enemy lands that are not responding when you tap on them. This didnt happen before.  I think updating attack list would be good. So you could see who you have attacked, not just who attck you. Just  a thought",
        "It's a great game but I think it be better if you created workers and mined,  lumbered, and gather favors or technology like warcraft use to be like.  The commands are also touchy and the battle displays for viewing if kinda difficult to  keep up with. But it's fun and a little bit addictive.",
        "Amazing graphic but really poor gameplay... Even lowest level, it's hard to complete easy campaign. Every win need to paid. Useless to raid... Uninteresting how the mission needed to complete... Disliked this game bcoz of the poor gameplay and the way of how to complete the mission.",
        "Ive been playing this game a very long time now. definitly a 5 star game in every aspect. only issue is.. i spend money on this last event.. 3 raids left to get 14k reward for the 4 star poison ranger.. the bloody game hang again..manage to log back only when the event was over..!!! Now i have this 2 useless relics taunting me.. Almost felt like deleting the game..",
        "One of these game where you need to pay to play if you want to be any good, slow if any support. If you don't have a life, you can get good a this game real quick. If you have low self-esteem, stay away, experience gamers will tear you a new one repeated, makes progressing to new lvls  slow."

        "Not a bad game but it's typical like some other games. It starts off with the levels being super easy, letting you build your confidence to get you thinking you're really good.  Now I understand the higher the levels the more difficulty there is but not to the point where they make it almost impossible trying to get you to buy more chances. Another words they're trying to get you to pay to win and advance not necessarily on skill level. Very sneaky. Uninstalling. It's fun for a while but overall I do not recommend.",
        "Love this game, but it freezes up. I go to try and reinstall it after a few days but it won't let me reinstall the game. Just stays at the same  level last completed. Still having the problem of when having to reinstall I lose all my lives and charms. Love the game but hate ,owing all my lives and charms",
        "I love this game but damn, why does the videos seem to always freeze up. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good game and all, so why don't you guys just fix the glitches. Thank you🤔",
        "The update took me from level 400 back to level 1 very upset be first I wasn't getting my daily play rewards so I figured like everything else it may need to update and the update blow my whole progress. I'm so pissed is there a way to fix this?",
        "I actually enjoyed the game and would give it four or five stars except 200 coins and multiple items were taking away simply because I got logged out if Facebook. Also several levels were lost.... This I understand, glitches happen. What I don't understand and don't accept is the lack of response from the developer. I've sent several emails and have yet to get a non automated response.",
        "I installed the game about 3 times and gave up. Can't connect with Facebook and when playing it suddenly stop and say it's not responding."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

They have done many great things, but the support more on non existent except for those who put thousands into the game.  I've dropped about $600 and the ignore my mails, msging via messenger.  Fun game, support is AWFUL",

        "It was Great, until the stupid game started crashing every day!  I spent cash on this, and to lose so much due to it glitching and crashing is unacceptable!  I'll give more stars when this issue is fixed... until then if you don't wanna lose your money die to crashes and glitches DO NOT INSTALL!   Update , I wish I could give negative Stars,  it is continuously CRASHING if my troops die due to FAILURE which is caused by the developers faulty upkeep this time, I'll quit and never play another game made by this company again!  SIMPLY FIX THE ISSUES ON YOUR GAME OR REDUND OUR MONEY, YA CROOKS!!!!!!😠😠😠😠😡",
        "Game was great. But now has to many glitches. Hopefully you don't have a problem because the support team is non existent. They never get back to you when you email them. I personally have list alot of troops because of glitches. 1 month ago I would have said download this game but I wouldn't now untill they fix the glitches.",
        "customer service is a joke. hard to find a game where owner/developer cares about their players that spend $500 to keep their servers running. player community great. rest sucks. I deleted this app after crashing almost everyday for a week"

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

        "To the guy that says stop bitching cuz it's free. Reviews are so they can get feedback to improve the game. What good is the game if you can only play 2 games a day? There are too many other games out there that are free that customers can get chips to play for hours. This game should take care of their loyal customers before they move on to some of the other games. So many have posted about the small amount of chips received and they added the spinning wheel, maybe by reading the reviews they are listening and trying to improve chances of getting more chips. If everyone continues to give low reviews, maybe just maybe they'll increase our chances to get more daily chips!",
        "Purchased 90 rockets pack. Explained to me how I used all 90 in one game? Smh, that's too much.. So y'all want ppl to purchase rockets each hand. Y'all can do better. Chip packages as well. Maybe u will get more to contribute to the game. Smh, better chip packages probably will definitely help this game. Especially the price of chips to play verses what the rooms payout... Really is at a disadvantage to players to even purchase.",
        "I usually love this game. However, today I decided to treat myself and purchase some chips to get the last two battle ships that I needed to get 800 chips. The game is so frigging rigged it's just sad. It took all 600 chips that I bought and all that I won trying to accomplish a goal.  I will NEVER purchase chips again, especially in this game.",
        "Most of my purchases lately have been strange disappearing chips and rockets i have spent SO much  money on this game!!! and another thing i could not access any games for 2 days now but it TOOK ALL MY CHIPS AGAIN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU IN REGARDS TO THIS.",
        "Good variety of games. Not many free chips once the first few rounds are played when compared to what the rounds cost. Be ready to buy, buy, buy if you aren't patient. They have added many more chances for free chips. Thank you guys.",
        "I love the game again.  I'd been struggling with glitches and now they're fixed  I'm especially loving the free chips you give sometimes daily!  I've become re-addicted to it!  The new format IS easier to see, but it gets slightly boring when the two cards you CAN daub don't get any numbers!  It looks as if you're phasing out the gems, which is fine with me; I'd rather have all free daubs, chips, and only a FEW coin power plays.  The free daubs make all the difference between winning and losing.  Also, would like to see winning bingos actually give me the items I need to complete rooms and for you to increase the daily chips for every completed room."

It makes you want to invest into this game. Not to mention how generous they can be with the free gifts and whatnot. Keep it up Netmarble!",

I also want to ask when will you give Odin a uniform? A better skillset, a heal, and a piercing ability for him to shine again as a god. Looking forward to it Netmarble.",
        "There are some incredibly predatory practices with the in app purchases.  For example, if you buy the new Emma Frost pack, you won't get her work fully leveled gear, and that isn't made clear on the purchase screen.  You will need to buy the package at least once, and possible multiple times over to actually advance her.",
        "Give credit to where credit is due. You guys are taking a step into the right direction. It is a small step, but still, it shows us that you listen. So please listen to us more. The game needs improvements on existing game modes that is becoming stale and boring and repetitive. Most players are also waiting for new game modes. This new update, Version 3.9, is like sending a message to your players that you are listening to them, and that is a good thing.",
        "This game was good. The past 6 months have just been a display of how game companies do not care for user experience but rather their pockets. Cash grab all the way. This game had potential to be the greatest, but a pure let down for the entire community."

        "Love this little game! I wish we had five life's, Three just gets me started. But overall, it's a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don't make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!",
        "Very hard and not as fun as the other games but  because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I've noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level. The most amazing part of this game are the graphics.  Awesome really awesome.  Very well done. Still playing this game but also still cannot convince my friends to get out of CC and other games. Will keep on trying though.",
        "This game is set up to STEAL a certain number of lives before you can win a level. Some levels, like Venice, level 79 may never be won. I have bought extra lives twice, extra moves twice, I REFUSE to make anymore purchases. If this was a truly user friendly game, it would BANK any extra moves, lighting, and other bonuses you've earned but did not use. But no, it throws them out. STEALS what you have earned. BANK it for me, I earned it, I should get to keep it. I'm done with this game.",
        "I am glad for the staff at big fish they did a wonderful job getting me back play after all my levels where lost.. They found them all and it made me happy that i can play where i was.. I can not play to often sometimes and had taken me a long time but look forward to every new city i get to open a new and all the challenges i get to participate in.  Thank you all for this game",
        "Fantastic game!  I love the graphics and interesting bits of trivia shared every time a landmark is built.  I also like the extra daily challenges and the special events that open up every so often.  Gummy Drop is challenging but can be played without needing to make any in-app purchases.  One con: the game starts you with three lives (lives replenish after 20 minutes), but in order to permanently increase your lives to five, you must pay $10.",
        "Surprisingly fun! I was setting the ads for this game everywhere but thought they were really unappealing. Work on your ads a little to emphasize the fun prizes for completing levels, the enjoyable hunt for tour letters in old levels, the history of the buildings you save! So many great things happening in this game."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",
        "This should be called Army Men Drama Field... This Game is a Joke along with the consultants you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than getting a hold of anyone. And it's like being in pre school you can get banned for saying a bad word 🤣 i wouldnt waste my money or time on this game"

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned",
        "Not only are the graphics realistic, there so persise on everything. They even allow you to purchase different variety of guns. I just wish they let you assemble your own gun, which of course accessories. Best sniper game I've ever played."

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "I was expecting this to come out soon, after all another build a medieval city clone. Nothing original about it. I play it only because of GOT theme. How to keep people playing? -Don't make the screen so congested. -Make stuff like buying a second builder permanent, not for 2 days.  -Basically don't make it P2W. If you don't get what I mean look up how EA messed up with Starwars Battlefront 2",
        "Alliances are complicated but use the chat feature and folk will tell you or PM you. It does take up a bit of time..IF YOU LET IT, but overall, not a bad game. Loads to do...follow what tyrion tells you. Wish I could find particular resources for crafting or I'm never gonna have a level 10 helmet haha. Have fun...don't let it rule your life",
        "12 days is an unacceptable amount of time to respond to a paying customer's problem. Is this the only way to get attention of WB? I have submitted ticket 5 times with no answer!",
        "Real truth! This game is built on your discourage to upgrade without buying. You can increase your castle but you have to spend real money all the time. Their rewards vs investment is 10% for you. You will spend your whole credit on this and still not be eligeable for the iron Throne. This is WB best scammed game out there! Things you 400 of to upgrade, only come as 6 units or less a month which pushes you to buy 100$ packages to upgrade. WB is laughting at you!",
        "Too expensive. The in-app purchases cost about 5-100 €. Those players who pay that on a regular basis dominate and win the game. Those players who don't are currently about 50 times smaller. It is like fighting off tanks and stealth bombers with flintstone and spears. You will lose.",
        "Great game, I like all the references to the show (the maester's tower, the different kingdoms/seats of power, etc.) I think the leige and alliance system is a bit complicated and I think the graphics could use a little work but other than that I really like it."

        "I love this game up until it asked me for a loan for one of the characters for 250 gems that i purchased. I contact Tech support and nothing is being done. After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",
        "In the world of cafe games this one is a gem that stands out like a diamond in the rough. Fun and easy to play, it's set at a relaxing pace with you learning new recipes and chatting with your customers. Who are all really interesting people with unique storylines....I think one of them is trying to steal the Mona Lisa,lol.",
        "Fix the controls! Atleast have an option to enable and disable the editing of the layout or location of the items in-game. Such a pain that God-forbid you touched an item for a half a second too long it will prompt you to move, delete or put that item in storage."

        "The best casino App I have played yet. You get to choose avatar and  have them choose which casino on the famous Last Vegas strip. Well you earn more casinos as you level up. And the balloon pop is fun too! And I won alot of money on the community bonus round. Where the people playing next  to you win during the bonus!",
        "Was good at first but, at a certain point the game is rigged worse than real slots in Vegas. Good rewards and all but, issue I have is I play a certain slot game longer than people who join later and they win large amounts immediately whereas about 90% of the time I lose chips more than win....I even switch up my bets and have bought chips thinking this would get the game to allow wins and nothing. Wanted to get enough V coins for Cirque but rather just pay full price at this point.",
        "I'm 6 levels shy of level 2000 and I just wanted to know if the daily reward and the hourly rewards will ever go up??? That'll be a great opportunity for players who reach a certain level in the game to collect a higher amount of money!!!   Also, how about EVERY weekend you'll do a DOUBLE YOUR MONEY when buying money!!!  That why you'll be making more money and customers can and will be very satisfied ever weekend...   P.S. THANKS FOR THE AWESOME GAME 👍👍👍👍👍",
        "It's cool, but one of the gimmicks is that you can play with other players, the problem is there is absolutely no way to play with your friends, you can only see the progress / help / be helped by complete strangers. Even if you invite a friend through fb... nothing. Not worth downloading until they update it.",
        "21 million in coin, the new game popup hi low comes on. I play, I go back to my game all coins gone. The Emerald 7 kept playing while i was gone evidently. But how does 21 million disappear with a bet of 300k in less than 5 minutes. This is second time I have tried this game. It just wants you to buy coin, jokers.",
        "If you have any problems with your chips, dont expect them to help in any way. I was losing chips after bonus game on cleopatra. They pretty much said its my fault."

        "Like ot a lot. Taskforces need to be improved drasticly. Focus on playing with others makes it a lot more fun. EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Update: Now it won't even open. Once you find out your progression is rigged, the fun wears off. You will have a win streak going, them \"mysteriously\" a machine will show up with just the right set up to beat yours. Then once you finally get the right configuration to beat that one (however long that takes) another machine with the perfect set up to beat yours shows up again preventing you from progressing. Over and over and over....",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete."

        "Had friends refer me to the  games. At 1st I wasn't  happy I couldn't  just  select  the games I wanted to play I had to earn the level it was on to open them. It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "House Of Fun Slots is the Best Slot Game you will ever play and I  promise that you want to play this and once you give it a try you will never want to put it down. I deleted all the other slot  games because they  can't  compare to  this game.  If I  could  give it  more then  55️⃣  star's 🌟 I most  definitely would.",
        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm"

        "I love playing this game. It is now my favorite phone game of all times. I have seen other reviews about waiting for energy takes too long. It does take a long time but to me that is part of it. It makes you slow down and enjoy simple fun. Too be honest all of us need to slow down and enjoy life around us. I play it on my breaks at work. The way you play this game allows for  short or long periods of play . Also it's quite fun seeing the little guy demolish tiles. It truly is an awesome game. I have recommended it to family and friends.",
        "I deleted all of my games except for Diggy's Adventure. This is my favorite game. I am going to play this game until me and Diggy win, and then I'm going to play it again from scratch. Google should make a whole lot of games like this. They are way better than match 3 puzzle games. I love cats I wish they could make a kitty's Adventures game like Diggy's Adventure.",
        "I've played this game for almost 2 years and have not once had a problem and have spent a lot of money. For some reason it's now crashing every few mins. I don't lose progress or anything but it's getting frustrating to have to keep restarting. I've even updated the app on my Android. Please help? It's my favorite app and I just want to dig!",
        "I really like this game but... It has been glitching A LOT for me lately. While I am playing it will freeze my phone. If I walk away for just a few seconds it freezes. My favorite glitch is after I watch a video for energy and before I use it the game kicks me out. Upon my return the energy is gone and I can't get energy for 2 more hours. 😐",
        "Very addictive game but you spend more time waiting for energy than playing. When you have unavoidable tiles of over 400 points it doesn't take long to lose all your stored energy. I thought games were for playing, not waiting around. It's play for 5 minutes wait for an hour. It's a shame because some of the puzzles are quite good.",
        "I love this game. It's super addicting and best paft..you don't HAVE to spend money on diamonds or add ons to actually play. I really get bored of games when all they want is more of your hard earned money. So keep up the great work."

But, there's not enough energy or chances to win energy or earn it. 10 isnt enough!There's times when I'm out of energy and have done everything I can do and have to leave the game but still feel like playing. I've spent money on this game but I don't always have money to buy energy or coins to buy energy. There should be more give-a-ways, prizes, little games, etc to earn more energy so I can keep playing!! Also, I'd like to be able to friend request other players and send them things. Like people on my team on here.  Thank you! Lynn Mauger",

Would keep people playing more and they would have more purchases! That's how I'd rack in the bucks if it were my app!",
        "2ND UPDATE: 3/21/18- Thank you for adding new bathrooms and bathroom rugs! Thank you also for giving new, unique furniture on 5th or 7th consecutive days. Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",
        "I like this game but it's frustrating how it's hard to get stars and then they want you to waste them on things like giving the cat a bath... I want to decorate the house not do all the silly side things."

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

        "I am ABSOLUTELY LOVING THE NEW GAMES!!! The free coins are very generous, but my only pet peeve is that I cannot seem to keep them very long. They go as fast as I win them! Also, the club coins could be a little higher. I send gifts to both friends and club members daily, but they're not enough to truly help anyone to continue to play.  But besides that, I just love DoubleU casino. I've been a member since practically the beginning and I will remain a faithful user! ☆☆☆☆☆",
        "This game is the biggest ripoff I have spent 100s of dollars of real money for nothing lost it all. Never get a Jackpot. A huge scam all they want is your money. No fun playing when you lose all the time really sucks would not recommend to anyone. I know you can't allways win but once in a while would be nice. Thanks for nothing Double U Casino.  Nicky",

        "Appsilutely amazing. Awosome gameplay, and amazing detail and graphics. Its like I'm inside the movie itself experiencing everything. Keep up the good work, only 1 problem. It keeps downloading every time I log in each day. Can you plz fix this?",
        "It's a great game.  The problem I have is you get screwed out of your prizes from time to time.  And then when you contact support you have to wait for 2 days.  Then you get a message assuming you dont understand how the game works and a thanks for understanding.  So the poor customer support is what got this game it's 2 stars from me and the prize screws.",
        "I have 1 level 20 T. Rex, 1 level 10 T. Rex, and a level 10 Pteradon and I STILL can't beat it. It's pissing me off. Do I need to have 3 fully maxed out T. Rexes in order to beat this stage? It's stupid.",
        "It was good at the beginning then I  got to a high level and it started kicking me out. I still have the same problem. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it even went onto their Facebook page and explain but there was still no fix. I give this game 2 stars. No point in trying to advance if problem is not fixed.",

Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

        "Well this is not a grate game this game is FANTASTIC  !!! Haven't seen any adds in over two weeks I've been playing it. I think they asked, but I came all by myself to rate it because its a grate game! Gorgeous graphics, controls are excellent, music is good  and most of all its quite interesting! Way to go people ! Thank you! Came back to update on my experience with this game. Over a month paying no  surprises, no adds, no asking to rate it just wonderful. Challenging at times than easyer and so on. Congratulations to the creators of this game and keep up the grate job!!! I am at the level 126!",
        "I am at level 218, since the recent update I am unable to play, screen goes to loading the level them just keeps loading, I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times with the same result. There's a glitch that I wish would be fixed before I decide to uninstall for good. Lost all of my gold bars, all of my cherries upon reinstall. It's a shame.",
        "Used to love this game. Now game is too difficult. Have to repeat level over and over again to move on. It is no longer fun to struggle at each level. That is frustrating...not relaxing.",
        "AHHHH ONCE AGAIN AN UPDATE THAT WIPED OUT EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED FOR.  SOMEDAY YOU'LL FIX THAT BUG!  It's better than any of the others despite bugs.",
        "Use to love it but shuts down every time I try to play lately!  Also have never been able to pick apples always says oops try again!",
        "I lost  300+ gold & 700+ cherries after the game crushed last night. worst update ever   UPDATE 20 MAR: Would you please add a comfirm message when using 10 golds for play on? I have to restart  saving for  golds after the evil update, and I just lost all the 40 golds by wiping play on accidently due to slow respones of the game."

Not pleased Abount it as I only play the game for short intervals.",

        "Wow! Developers you have ruined this game. I am playing this game for more than 3 months and this new co op battle features ruined all those people were gathering for so many days. Thank you for ruining this good game due to your greed that people will spend money. Thank you again!",
        "It's a great game, addictive. You get let down though if you're like me and won't spend money like others... they'll end up whooping ya",
        "2d just like pictures. Pay $$$ to be able to kill people. No teamwork. If you don't pay $$ you will end up deleting your app. People spend $1000 of dollars.",
        "Lost my game when my phone crashed. Any way to restore? Still using the same device",
        "Not a bad game although it could do with a lot of expansion like increase max levels to 300 instead of 30. Put real investment properties that generate different amounts of income such as restaurants, casinos, beachside properties etc. Add more equipment and even vehicles like Hummer, armoured truck to boost your attack and defense",
        "Very addicting ,Great Game love it ,it's the GodFather so i wouldn't expect less,you guys are awesome don't never forget that and thanks for such a Great game.Much Respect for the entire Team who has helped create and develop this Game✊😎and always to the GodFather."

Many videos crash the game, which means you lose the treat you would otherwise earn by watching those ads. Other crashing problems as well.",
        "For not getting even the first event bird out of 3 in alien excavation after opening so many premium eggs reaching (*4) of the premium eggs. I blame - chimera and rovio. Either the makers of the game are idiots or the game is stupid and seriously 2000 per month for an imaginary egg everyday that cannot guarantee a 4 or 5 star bird. Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",
        "I did not expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I have. The frequent events are nice and having a guild just makes them better. I don't feel compelled to be social be because there is no chat, just playing the game. It is a wonderful balance.",
        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "Decent game, lots of fun to keep you coming back. I would of rated a 4 star game but every time I need to watch a video the game stops working, stopping me from getting a free premium egg or opening chests!"

There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "The app is really good. It's addictive. But, I really feel they should give out cash or diamonds more easily. If we could earn diamonds or cash for watching a video then it would be great. Cause it takes time for the looks to get voted and until then we cannot play and wait for the diamonds. It's kinda sad. Hope they'll look into this.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5☆"

        "Game is amazing Love it. Customer service well you have none. All you get is automated message and no way to speak to someone about any issues. You give them what they need and no one fallows up on it. All you get back is the same automated response. Then they remove your ticket. So if you have problems with the game don't bother contacting them it's a waist of your time. THERE'S NO ONE THERE FOR YOU. Can't get my account back. That's all I want. It's simple NO???????",
        "Another month, another violent smash and cash grab. Putting an entire LT behind a character requirement that 99.9% of the player base has next to no chance of getting with obfuscated \"odds\" that require one to spend 1000s of dollars for a \"chance\"(not even guaranteed) to get a character. At this point, I'm only updating the game to keep my reviews more relevant and higher weight.",
        "It's a good game. Awesome graphics, great gameplay,amazing superstar etc. But not good for free player because you don't get good superstar and rate of getting better superstar is very very low. Even some time in 4 pulls. I didn't get any 2 star silver card. Please make rare superstar drop rate more or I can't go any further in this game and make this game more free player friendly.",
        "Basically I have been playing this game over the past year... It is a totally addictive and 100% entertaining game... Only downside which has forced me to stop playing is that I have just acquired a new phone and attempted to load the game with my login details (for both Facebook & Google) but have found that I now have to start from the beginning again... I've now become mildly disappointed unless this can be fixed I don't think I will be playing again as I put too much time into this for me to start from the beginning again!!!",
        "It is my favrt game ever when i play this i stuck with this game I want to say something  now it's giving  too many ads and a problem  when I log out it says only one thing again and again that this account using on another device  but it's not real and what I do I am help less and I can't get new powerful superstars 😭😭😭😭😭when I open with cash he always give me duplicates.. Give some new cool events like wrestlemaina T-shirts..",
        "Love playing this game until google services crashed my phone and when I came back on to the game after having to reset everything, I lost access to my account. I have contacted customer services and all they do is send a pregenerated message that answers and resolves nothing!!  5 days and still receiving the same message back.. Even my faction leader has provided information to determine that my account is indeed my account and that I am active in his faction. But still SCOPELY send the same annoying generated message. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICES EVER!!!"

        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I've really enjoyed reading All the Wrong reasons.  The author is very talented, a true story teller.  As I was reading I felt like part of the story I was so enveloped in the lives of the characters they were alive and real. I was sad when the story ended wanted to keep reading.  I was overjoyed when K. I. S. S.  came out by that very sane author who transported me to a whole new world yet again. I look forward to reading more from this amazingly talented storyteller!!",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked."

No way of contacting support/help desk either as just get error message when trying. Hugely disappointed after all the months of playing!",
        "Should have longer time on the tradefest. Not everyone has time to just sit on the game 24/7.  More opportunities to win things. Don't like how I have to pay to plant my own crops on my own island though?! And why has the harvest count changed? Why make bad changes to the game? It just shys people away.",
        "Loved this game and the players in it. BUT if you are not in their beta test group it's getting discouraging that you are not treated as equal as the others and you need to put much more effort and time to get rewards and move along in the levels. Don't start unless you like to be treated with no respect at all",
        "Well the game is great!! This morning when I was using it tho the time it would take for things to be done was reduced greatly, everything was 2 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins and 15, and I was impressed and decided that if its a new update I'd glady play more often. The second time I went back on everything was back to the old time period of production. I was disappointed and didn't bother to spend even 5mins more on it. I believe everyone would find it more exciting to play if the time for production wasn't so long. I hope that this can happen in another update, if not, well I can't do nothing about that.",
        "Gave it a lower rating because I sent 3 messages to support regarding loading error and never received a response just kept sending me to the games web page which was of no help. Very fun game but no support it seems",
        "I love this game! It is my favorite! I like how can earn gems! I love the different 'contests.' However, I tried really hard to get the snowy owl and didn't make it in time. Now I'm not playing as much but still love the game!"

The rewards for victory are so small it's almost impossible to upgrade your base unless of course you pay for a shield,but even that's a scam cause with a shield you can't atracvk enemy bases.  Everything is basically pay to upgrade or spend forever trying to save up and even then. Bottom line ftx games are a scam. A shame too I really liked the game at first. But once you start buying stuff for it, it keeps you in a position where you have to keep on paying to have a chance.",

You watch adds for a speed up, nothing happen, you install other apps for gold, nothing happen, you submit a report to customer service,nothing happen, they send back problem solved and they didn't do anything about. I bought gold for the app from one of their sponsors, nothing happen. I report it , a girl named Daria sent me back a email and said problem solved, guess what...NOTHING HAPPENED",
        "Total rip off dont waste your time or money. Ever since update..its horrible. The developers will swipe your gold away (basically your money) and give an excuse that your bank or Google issued a refund. After showing and providing evidence that your never received a refund...they do nothing about it! Straight run around. And good luck talking to support..generic responses like the one they give on here.",

        "New Review because of update: ° I really love this game. I'm hooked. Relaxing yet stimulating. Some levels are easy as cutting through soft butter with lots of delightful bombs and others take several tries to master and need that one devise a strategy and some others are much up to luck. I love that variation: relaxing and stimulating and sometimes a bit frustrating. ° I had finished all the levels of version 2 and then waited for an update which came with new levels and I finished them also about 4 weeks ago. I've opened the game every day since to see if yet an other update came, and yes, yesterday it did and have already finished all levels (that says more about my fanaticism than it says about the difficulty of the game). ° I appreciate the tournament (I topped the monthly yesterday but had dropped 3 steps while I was sleeping and have clawed my way back to the top this evening, but I guess I'll be back down tomorrow. But it's fun! And I got generous daily prizes. ° And I love the new version that even though I again have finished all levels, I can just go on playing thanks to the Level Tower (even if it at 46 repeated a previous level). ° Lovely graphics, good game sound.",
        "Annoying and boring. Got headaches playing this. You can spend 5 sets of 5 lives each without passing the task. It's rather a \"Push to pay or wait forever\" game. Uninstalled. Sorry.",

You should patch the game after some time, after you have the revenue. Cars not even look like they \"look\" in the real life. The gameplay is alright so far, might become enjoyable for a longer gameplay.   Just started, but I wasn't suggested to invite my friends to play. Correct it also for making the community larger. Where is the option to play with my friends? Also, any crew creator option? So far , 4/5. Started yesterday",

It does have pacts of cards to buy with real money, yet at the same time you earn gold coins to buy same packs. You can easily save the gold coins to buy these packs. LOVE THIS GAME",

They r broken",

        "Clash of clan pak 11 from 250 up to 5150... How the hell? Our clan tried and still we received nothing. I was way over the 500 points to get the legendary pack but no I don't get it. Your replies seem to be automated with certain words triggering certain responses. Sort your stuff out people, get your house in order and give us what we deserve. Our legendary bonnet head. I will be uninstalling if you don't come around",
        "Fun game. Good graphics, and overall good fishing simulator. However, its ridiculously rigged. I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",
        "OUT OF ALL THE FISHING GAMES THAT ARE ON THE APP STORE I'VE FOUND ONLY 3 WORTH PLAYING,AND THIS MY FRIENDS IS ONE OF THEM!!!!!!! IT'S A MUST DOWNLOAD AND TRY FISHING GAME/APP!! GREAT GRAPHICS, AND DESIGN!!! IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS FISHING GAME/APP THEN YOU ARE MISSY OUT ON A FANTASTIC DAY OF FISHING!!!!  SO STOP READING AND GET TO DOWNLOADING THIS APP, AND GET TO ALL THE INCREASABLE FISHING FUN!!!!!!😎😋🤣😄😅😁😂🤗😜😛😌😳😱😰",
        "This game is so AWESOME! This game will also teach you alot about the fish you are catching. Great time killer. Just becareful you'll kill to much time. LOL I just realized it's 2:04am. I have to be at work at 6:00am. Download this game now! Thank you for making an AMAZING fishing game. Hats off to the creater's",
        "This game is great and what it does, massive castles sprawling battles across the ages with wizards on dragons back firing missiles at unicorns below... Erm it's fishing they lured me in and I'm hooked, what else is there to say. Great game.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "All round best racing game I have played so far! That said, the game becomes very difficult as one goes above REP 60. It becomes very time consuming to proceed in the game without spending actual money. Useful stuff becomes harder to obtain via docks and via older races, which is frustrating.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "The game is pretty good, being a free mobile game, it is not trying to hide it's PTW features, but you can do mostly everything without having to spend a penny. One suggestion I think needs to be put in place is a confirmation window when you go to skip a level, because I was doing the speedhunter event for the Mazda MX-5, and accidentally hit the skip race button and lost a lot of gold, maybe not letting me even get the upgraded car now."

Not only that got to be a General in the #1Ranked alliance for over a year and a half..if we fall..we always come back...Alliance Lords of War LoW  best game and alliance going.. thank you soldiers inc for incredible Game play",
        "It would be nice to find a better way for allies to communicate via voice chat. Communication is key to victory and should be given to those who earn it and are serious about the game and want to become the Elite. Overall a great game even after 3+ years of gameplay. You will make tons of friends here so join already ;-)",
        "After newest update, can no longer play on an S8 plus because most of the controls are off screen and can not adjust it to be non full screen mode anymore",
        "Good game but needs a fair play policy players level 80 are attacking players  at really low levels not giving them a chance to build up.",
        "Plarium do not like Aussies. They charge us extra money for offers.   A top end offer is $100 USD for the Americans. Which is $120-125 AUD after currency conversion for Australians. Yet for some reason our offers are $160 AUD. $35 AUD more then we should be paying.   I do not know how this practice has gone without incident as I thought there were supposed to be good anti descrimination laws and consumer laws in place that prevent the charging of extra to countries just because they do not like that country.   This is a morally disgusting practice as it is the same concept as charging more to others purely on the basis because they have a different skin colour, gender or religion.   I want to know why Australians are paying an extra $35 AUD then we should be as other mobile games. One example being Battle Mobile do the correct currency exchange rate and only charge $125 AUD after conversion from $100 USD. If other mobile games do it correctly why are Plarium choosing not to?  Edit: @ Plarium employee who just lied in response to me. Plarium set all prices up themselves through Google Playstore. NOT Google.",
        "it's a amazing game real challenging I always get attack well not always so it's always challenging for me and for new players i also dont get much storage items and troops because of how many players attack me"

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

The little things like having to click on the stars over your dragons in order to allow someone else to play with them. That sort of thing. Otherwise it's a great game and it provides me with hours of fun and relaxation.",
        "I have been playing this game since 2012. It used to be great, but in the past 1-2 years it has become insane. The events are ALWAYS overlapped with 2-3 events happening simultaneously, and they have become much more difficult to complete. It is literally impossible to collect every dragon without spending some big bucks, and the only way to enjoy this game is to focus on only getting the dragons you like. This still proves to be difficult given the 1000+ dragons released already...",
        "Game is ok easy to follow and play. Constslly full of ads and server sync so takes forever to get in if its lets you in and then start the ads, annoying request from side ventures to get more cash from you. Apple verson has more and programers to lazy to do same here but make you compete against them",
        "This game is getting better and closer to equal to ios but still needs some work. More dragons should have their own type and not all mashed into the star. Also all buildings and arena need this the type chooser. More mining land and better crops are needed. Please fix the emoji so android can use its system wide color emoji now. Out of curiosity why does ios get a new description announcing the codex and Android is always bug fixes. You guys could just copy and paste that but don't even bother to change for us Android users?",
        "I got a new phone and when I transferred all of my app's it did Not transferr my levels!! I had hours of fun, not so sure now. I still play and love it. I wish we could get more gold through friends or the wheel.",
        "Been playing for few years now. Used to be great game but now when I play all of a sudden the game freezes and everything Ive done in last minute or so disappears. I thought it might be my tablet but after purchasing new tablet the problem still exists. I now know its the game as I have noticed that when game freezes and then restarts, I have a progress sign appear and when I click on it it tells me the progress of a dragon that gives you two gold as a reward but I am doing nothing to trigger this. This is seriously frustrating when using a boost on bingo leagues as the countdown doesnt freeze. Fix this and it's 5 stars all the way."

        "Challenging game against live players. Lots of contests and bonuses. Levels of play from beginner to world class. One drawback: all levels are open entry, so more experienced (and less ethical) players will enter into Beginner to collect quick victories. The designers should change the game so that once a badge is completed, players should not be able to enter games on that level again. This would be fair play for beginners, encouraging them to continue playing. Hope this is implemented in an update.",
        "Game graphics and play are great. However dice rolls are seriously flawed. Doubles way too often. Not even close to real rolling. I've seen 2 sets of doubles in way to many starts of the game. If doubles are so common why don't you ever see 3 doubles in a row to start. Don't ever leave a piece open because the next roll will knock you almost every time. The developer obviously likes frustration proven by the childish limited chat emojis.",
        "They need to fix the dice roll. Its absolutely a big cheat...no way can some roll exactly what they need to get out of a tight position that often. Its really horrible it ruins the whole game.",
        "I think it's safe to say based on the dice timing, that this game app, like all the rest, is favoring a particular player in order to end the game quicker. The auto play is annoying and not possible to turn off.. but the layout is nice.",
        "It's the worst game i have ever played , they are thieves , when you double and you lose they deduct twice the bet and when u win they only give you 45 percent of ur total winning money.I played a game and won 255 thousand , but they only gave me 120 thousand , and when i lost they took out 255 thousand from my money.If you dont believe me count ur chips and see.They suck so go to hell with this lame unfair idiot game.",
        "The dice rolling is not random at all !  It gives ridiculously lucky dices and game over in 3 or 4 turns. Do not play it. NO RANDOM DICE, NO FUN AT ALL !!!"

        "Dear team, It's really a awesome game ever. I'm playing it since 2 years. Very addictive. But i request you to all, when we start a TEAM RACE many players join clans for playing team race n take efforts in team race for getting better reward but many of them team leaders kick players just before ending the team race n players won't receieve any reward for it. It was happened with me 2 times. So please do any update for those players who take much efforts in team war and then also they get nothing. Thanks",
        "This game used to be 5 star. They've changed it where all team events are gem sucks. You have no chance of winning without using a considerable amount of gems. They've taken away most in game free ways to get gems, and to buy them is not worth it, they're very over priced. It's not a team event, it's a paid for event. If they change it and make it more fair for everyone I'll make a new rating.",
        "It's a nice game with so many awesome monsters. I like it and it's my favourite game in this category. My suggestion is that if you can include an option to cancel ongoing breeding by giving gold or gems or without anything, it would have been better. The game has events that comes very frequently, it helps so much in getting new monsters and or progressing in the game.",
        "The game is awesome! The game play, the monsters, and also the actual fighting and graphics. This is one of my most rated games and my most played; I couldn't go a day without it. It's competition is so good online with people and in dungeons and the map, also team wars are fun with your friends. Get this game you'll never regret it.",
        "DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. Recently my account was reset due to the game posting the wrong price of gems. I have lost everything even the things I paid full price for. I have been robbed of gems, cells, gold, food and my time. If you do play the game, don't spend actual money because they can take it all away. BE CAREFUL"

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

Doesn't even crash anymore, just quits mid-play and I lose whatever progress I'd made. I play when I can on my tablet, but it's just not the same. I don't know why it won't work on my phone without spontaneously closing! 5 stars if it did...",
        "I love, love  this game is difficult to play, but to my opinion is the best game on line ihave been playing for 2 years and my goal is to beat it . you get rewards. I spend money but with the rewards you get something back  ,also I just started another game with is similar like pandapop and iam a also give it 5 stars . even that iam a grandmother of 72 years old. I still popping. !!",
        "A wonderful game to have very fun and exciting install right away you won't regret it. I've reached level 1049. It is super exciting to me learning how to Ricochet the balls off the walls. The projection of the angle need it. This is my all-time favorite and I highly recommend it to my friends and family. Plus, the little bit of flaws and the enemies within the game, will have you taking a break and coming back for more. Just know that I've deleted this game twice but always came back to it because this game , is fun and challenging .  If you don't like a challenge you won't like this game .  Just so you know , it does not require internet, to be able to play this game like others. Technicians please put out more games that don't need the Internet to play. This game is one of them. Just know that option is super helpful. We need more games able to be played without internet intervention. Ty taking time to read this. Have fun a Poppin. LOL",
        "Not bad, not great. Randomly stops in the middle of play and you lose a life. Also takes a long time to load and to move to the next level. Okay for free, but if I paid for it I would be asking four a refund.  Update: I've contacted the developers multiple times. They keep sending the same canned response.  Game crashes frequently. Frustrating when you are just about to finish a level. Uninstalling.",
        "I use to give this a 5 star rating until I lost all of my panda belt progress when I updated, 5 days ago. I sent a report to you and got a message that said there was a problem with the update. I'm still waiting for an answer on when this will be fixed. I refuse to play any levels or specisls, like badboon lair until I can receive the panda belt credits. If I don't receive the panda belt credits or if I am not credited for the points that I lost I will uninstall this game!!!!!",
        "I loved this game and have played it for a few years now. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the last few months, it just closes on me mid play and I lose on my progress, as well as any items and special powers that I used to advance in a level. Very frustrating to lose items and have to start all over on the level."

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

        "The game itself is wonderful, but I've had this bug ever since Chapter 2 or 3 (I just finished Chapter 12) where when I finish the final level, the screen goes black and won't play the cutscene. I end up having to close the game and never get to see it, then I go into the next Chapter not really knowing what's going on. The story is important to me and it's very unfortunate that this is happening. A fix from the developers or a suggestion on something I can do would be greatly appreciated.",
        "Really enjoy this game.  Just wish we could pay for land expansions because they don't come fast enough.  Running out of room to place everything.  Yes they have the cargo ship but you lose points for doing that.",
        "I play whenever I can. Very Enjoyable!  Love both searching scenes and decorating my island. Love being able to rearrange, and I wish I could move the gifts I receive.  Don't like waiting the 4 hours to regain energy and I would gladly watch ads to be able to fill my energy. It would be nice to have a larger expansion area while needing the same requirements. Love the speciality collections!  Great job!",
        "In one of the recent updates, the timers to receive flowers messed up.  Purchased the passenger car and I'm on the fourth day so far. It counts down, but just before it finishes, another day is added.",

        "Warning! Once you start playing Angry Birds Match you'll never want to stop! I love this game. I have been looking for a game that isn't so easy I get bored or too hard I get angry! This game is perfect! The only thing I would like is could you possibly offer other ways to get more lives? Like watch a video to fill up ( like angry birds pop) or spin the wheel? I just hate waiting soooo long when I run out of lives, because I want to keep playing!!!!",
        "I've enjoyed this game, but I haven't been able to open it for several days. I hate to uninstall and lose all my progress. Any help would be appreciated. Ok, so after about a month of not loading it started working...for a month now it's down again. I upgraded today, 2/19, and still won't open, grrrr! Help!! Changed my 5 stars to 1! The game constantly freezes, closes and then won't reload. I've reinstalled 4 times and that's it I'm done. Really disappointing as when it runs it's so much fun.",
        "For some reason right in the middle of playing it has been quitting and then I lose that life. Very frustrating. Is there and update available?",
        "I love this game but for like 3 months since i updated I can't play and I just updated again and still the same doesn't let the game download it frozes, can you please fix that, or let me know what i can do, I dont want to uninstall it so I don't loose my progress.  Starting to get aggravated.  Thank you.",
        "I like this game a lot and would give higher reviews but a lot of times if I am playing a level and have one move left it ends the level and I never get to make the move. It's some kind of glitch in the game. I think it's trying to get me to buy gems and coins. Very frustrating and annoying.",
        "It seems to me that the objects to move are too small, it is always moving wrong way that I am trying to move. You should be able to select move by tapping, then swipe."

        "It's a very realistic tycoon games. Had lots of run buying 'real' properties as I travel. The market place bidding section is like a trading floor.  🌟  because the bugs are not being fixed and is affecting game play. Added on 5/3/18 I have been writing to you about this issue. The fix you provide doesn't last.",
        "It was a great game..... until they started removing coins from your balance after watching ads.... I sent a support ticket and they told me it is a known issue, but there's nothing they can do to fix it... And they would not credit me back my lost coins!",
        "This game is interesting. It isn't time consuming, which is good and it is still be entertaining.Every 2-3 days I check on the game to wait till my money is full and I buy new properties which, I have to admit is quite satisfying. Especially if you own 100% of it.The only downside I could find is the coins system which gives upper hand for gamers that have money to spend into this type of game. However i still find it entertaining and I'm trying to make my own way through competition into getting first place on all rankings.  Edit:once you get rich you can't buy any properties, they're all cheap and not worth investment. You also need to play the game everyday and look for expensive properties that don't exsist. Buying properties from auctions is also not an option as most of the time it's not worth buying one.",
        "Fun and challenging.  It takes patience to excel. Sometimes the map needs updating (abandoned business block away) but dont buy those. Also id say skip watching ads for coins because they disappear.  Anyways, enjoy. Could be the lifelong game you've been waiting for!",
        "This is a game that is played with the real structures around you (like Ingress and Pokemon Go) but it's for buying, selling, and gaining revenue on real properties.  It's a pretty good game if you're in it for the long haul. The interface and graphics seem pretty old/bland, though.",
        "Great game and app. Developers do a great job updating it to make it better and responding to any questions in a timely manner. Very addicting real situation game. I love it. Just wish they would provide some incentives to those of us who purchase coins on a regular basis."

Edit- ok I'm in again, but I'm still mad, but relieved I didn't throw away my money. OTHER games send a apology message than an update is being performed or something. But as a game it is fun & strategic",
        "Would have given 4 stars if it didn't make you wait 4hrs on the pvp award or at least make the 4 he wait start when you first make the 1-5 match. Not wait 4 hrs after you complete 5-5. Look at how Clash Royale has their setup. Your already  trying to mimic their game. You should study their gameplay more and use it for improvements. Just saying. Make a change in that 4hr wait.",
        "Since the new update, major loading issues. Game just freezes on the title screen. I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the PVP battles not being fair, but they usually within reason. My main complaint is THE HACKERS WHO DRIVE ME TO THE POINT OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. This game has great potential, it just needs the major issues addressed.",
        "It's needed bug fixes for HTC One M8 since release. Current event RoboBebe stuck at applying configs. Matches work fine over my work hotel wifi but home wifi must reconnect after every match pvp or solo. 5* is my opinion regardless just 1* to try and catch devs attention",
        "Too many hackers since the beginning of the BFU!!! Too many are using a computer hack to play and cause energy speed ups. It causes the game to lag. Then I loose with an connection error or they just over power me with too many units on the field. Its ridiculous. I will change review when issues with them are fixed.   Now with one day to get to legendary tje game crashed...pathetic. Wish i could give a lower rating",
        "Would love to give 5 stars but I cannot even play. I downloaded, then went to play and got as far as the \"logging on\" page before the game said \"error no network connection\" when I clearly am connected.  EDIT : the issue has been resolved. Changed my rating to 5 stars as promised"

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

Not to your Facebook account, or Google play game and has problems with it's server. Why any one would spend money on this game until they could at least save stuff is beyond me.",
        "MY STORY OF HUNGRY SHARK  I've been playing hungry Shri since years and I reached my tiger shark.... suddenly it got updated and I lost all my progress and returned to the first level of reef shark...I was so disappointed and uninstalled the game after a few months I reinstalled it and while playing I saw the cloud save and clicked it.....I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD RETURN TO MY PROGRESS....I enjoy playing it and I love the new background and updates  Best wishes- A hungry shark fan",
        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "It's mindless fun and the soft gore while eating a human is fun. The underwater scenes are visually pleasant. I also like the feature that warps you to the North Pole once a day. The random vortexs that throw you into space are also a really fun feature."

        "A well made app that's immersive, addictive, and the essence of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. The app is mission based and has a complex but easy to use medal system with rock-paper-scissors type of combat. You can join/make a party, or go solo. Money isn't an issue so long as you pace yourself. It gets better the more you play. There are optional event quests and a story, but don't fret if you can't get the app or just starting out; it's slow going. 735 quests.",
        "Liking the cute art style but my god does this game take forever to download even with a low resolution. Has taken me two attempts and I'm doubtful that it's related to my broadband speed and connection (not sure if it's to do with my phone? But again, doubtful.) Would be great if this could be fixed somehow.",
        "I freaking love this game! However I have a small complaint that is probably fixable. I was wondering for my lg g6 if you could expand the borders so the screen would fit. And if the screen is not able to get any bigger, I'm hoping you people can at least put a cool border around it instead of leaving it as a black bar. I know you people can make cool borders. Thanks for your attention!",
        "Hey guys, huge fan of the kingdom hearts series and also the game in general. Though one thing I wish you could add is the option to link your data to your Google Play account as well as Facebook. Not a lot of us use Facebook so I wish there was more options to get your data back if you ever deleted the app. Otherwise, good game!",
        "I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn't really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.",
        "[Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!"

        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance"

Im trying my best to play this game that i loved and win some good characters but why is it everytime in road to glory there is a network issue well in fact in other game modes there is none. PLEASE FIX THIS NET ISSUE WERE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO WIN BUT ENDED UP LOSING BECAUSE OF THE NET ISSUE. . Thanks. I love this game so much so please be fair.",
        "Women's Royal Rumble. Generous fair ads mid way between limited and unlimited leading to competitiveness going back to it. So much better than old s4 and it's only day 1. Can't talk about heroic yet haven't got one but sounds good too.",
        "Love the app and the game it is very addictive. I love the changes to season 4; however your ticket store and CP PVP store is still bugged as I am still getting cards well below my rank. Also PVP is very buggy as I am always seeing waiting for opponent or opponent is viewing last match which isn't an option. Just wondering if there is a security team that monitors online activity because it seems like a lot of people are manipulating the network at times.",
        "I like the game but last week 2 of my cards where removed I didn't accidentally delete them. They was locked. I emailed and got told that there was nothing they can do. It is a Titan pro Neville and a beast pro Tamina can someone help me get my cards back I played a lot of games to pro them right",
        "Horrible, disgusting excuse for customer service I have ever seen. Automated response no matter the issue. Never a problem ( and there are many many many issues.) Do not let the WWE license fool you, this is NOT a company I would support and I'm not sure why WWE can't find another company to produce a game.like this.",
        "They are still plagued by PVP issues that they claim they are fixing, but never do anything about. Not worth playing as you won't actually recieve your rewards for playing, and they won't help you if you send in a help ticket. You will only get form letter responses. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."

Not only that got to be a General in the #1Ranked alliance for over a year and a half..if we fall..we always come back...Alliance Lords of War LoW  best game and alliance going.. thank you soldiers inc for incredible Game play",
        "It would be nice to find a better way for allies to communicate via voice chat. Communication is key to victory and should be given to those who earn it and are serious about the game and want to become the Elite. Overall a great game even after 3+ years of gameplay. You will make tons of friends here so join already ;-)",
        "After newest update, can no longer play on an S8 plus because most of the controls are off screen and can not adjust it to be non full screen mode anymore",
        "Good game but needs a fair play policy players level 80 are attacking players  at really low levels not giving them a chance to build up.",
        "Plarium do not like Aussies. They charge us extra money for offers.   A top end offer is $100 USD for the Americans. Which is $120-125 AUD after currency conversion for Australians. Yet for some reason our offers are $160 AUD. $35 AUD more then we should be paying.   I do not know how this practice has gone without incident as I thought there were supposed to be good anti descrimination laws and consumer laws in place that prevent the charging of extra to countries just because they do not like that country.   This is a morally disgusting practice as it is the same concept as charging more to others purely on the basis because they have a different skin colour, gender or religion.   I want to know why Australians are paying an extra $35 AUD then we should be as other mobile games. One example being Battle Mobile do the correct currency exchange rate and only charge $125 AUD after conversion from $100 USD. If other mobile games do it correctly why are Plarium choosing not to?  Edit: @ Plarium employee who just lied in response to me. Plarium set all prices up themselves through Google Playstore. NOT Google.",
        "it's a amazing game real challenging I always get attack well not always so it's always challenging for me and for new players i also dont get much storage items and troops because of how many players attack me"

        "I'm giving 4 star becuz I need help from you devs! I play GOP3 in STEAM directly in PC & I have an option to synch my steam account to my Android, I tried all the steps that's listed. But it ain't working. Can you help me out? Cuz if u help me, I personally feel you guys deserve a 5 star :)",
        "Now I remember why I deleted this in the first place. Terrible game. Hardly ever win a hand. Too many so called 'players' keep raising so you lose more than you win. Deleting for the last time!",
        "If you continuously win you lose continuously and if you have a lot of chips you'll lose the chips know why? This games is money hungry and wants you to buy stuff I had 25 million and now I have 13 million because the dealer got 20 2 times in a row mabey if you made the cards random and didint do what I complained about I would've gave this 5 stars.",
        "There's a few small glitches but they are always keeping up and listening to players comments to make things better,  bravo! Really fun team challenges separates gop3 from all others.",
        "This game is garbage the daily spin is garbage and the hands are not good ever. Unless your willing to spend money everyday don't bother. IT doesn't respond back to tech issues eith."

The payouts aren't quite as good, but maybe you just have to play more to see a good outcome. Overall a great slots game, with potential to be one of the best!",

I do have a suggestion, can you add like a one park/any place where players can meet with other players and chat? It would be great to interact with other players, not just in your guild group 😊 hoping you'll consider it. Thank you so much for making this game! So addicting!",
        "It'll be nice if we earn those ITEMS given in the stages description.  I kept on earning only common item no epic or legendary.  Which is sad but game is smooth which is good.  Thank you google for the update.  If we may add would love an auto healing potion during adventure. Thank you",
        "Edit: Issue was resolved and devs were very quick to reply and help, which they seem to do consistently. I really love this game because it's easy to get good equipment and currency, you aren't forced to pay to win. Rewards for login/quests are very generous, prices of cards to equip new items isn't unreasonable. The characters and items you can equip look stunning. The only thing I can criticise is the unbalanced PvP, but I solve that by not playing PvP lol.",
        "Marvelous heroes, outstanding graphics, excellent costumes, and cute pets. I realy like this game. But I hope this game would turn into an open world where all players could see each other at a single area. Perhaps a town or some kind of a city where everyone could gather and more features like whispers, world chat, etc. Well aside from that the game is totally amazing. Would much likely recommend this game.",
        "Great game beside the fact it is a memory-eater this is exactly what you expect from cell game in 2018 good graphic smooth gameplay and enough energy reward not to worry about beeing stpp because of a lack of it. The omly downside is the pvp which is build in a way you are up against player who 1HKO you which get pretty frustrating.",
        "Can't play the game after the latest update. I've downloaded the latest update, able to play it for few minutes. Then, it stop responding. When I tried to relaunch, after the Google Play Store and Nexus logo, it just stuck on the black screen. Nothing happened, waited for 5 minutes, still nothing happened. So I deleted the app and reinstall it. Still stuck on the black screen after the google plastore and nexus logo. Hopefully u guys patch this up ASAP, and I'll gladly change the rating once this is sorted out"

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

        "The game itself is wonderful, but I've had this bug ever since Chapter 2 or 3 (I just finished Chapter 12) where when I finish the final level, the screen goes black and won't play the cutscene. I end up having to close the game and never get to see it, then I go into the next Chapter not really knowing what's going on. The story is important to me and it's very unfortunate that this is happening. A fix from the developers or a suggestion on something I can do would be greatly appreciated.",

        "I play whenever I can. Very Enjoyable!  Love both searching scenes and decorating my island. Love being able to rearrange, and I wish I could move the gifts I receive.  Don't like waiting the 4 hours to regain energy and I would gladly watch ads to be able to fill my energy. It would be nice to have a larger expansion area while needing the same requirements. Love the speciality collections!  Great job!",
        "In one of the recent updates, the timers to receive flowers messed up.  Purchased the passenger car and I'm on the fourth day so far. It counts down, but just before it finishes, another day is added.",

        "It's sad to see people complaining and giving bad reviews about crashing but not knowing it's probably because their device is  g a r b a g e. I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "It's good and alot of fun but it's a bit of a tedious grindfest. 150% item find and I found nothing after going through ten dungeons. I want to keep playing but it's just another pay to win type. I understand you need to make money but I can buy a full loadout of epic equipment and run through a great portion of the game in no time. It's definetly worth giving a try but unfortunetly it's not for me.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!"

        "This is one of the best rpgs out there in my opinion for a few reasons the graphics are very nice, rpgs whos graphics try to get really realistic are just not the same it looks blan likr that. My next reason is it isnt a pay to win game. For all of the people out there who like to pay a lot of money, its just dum. Money for a game should only be for cosmetic items to make you look really cool not to boost you 10 tens ahead of everyone, and for that I thank you Allstar gaming. Paying does get you a boost in game its just not very big the only reason rating s are so bad is cuz the top up didnt give them anything which is a huge bug.",

I came acrossed this one from a Facebook add and as soon as I started playying it has been super fun every since. The p2w ratio is literally not high at all. So F2P can definitely gain just ad much. Awesome gameplay good graphics for the game itself overall I definitely recommend this game. ♡",
        "Game sucks! No control in game for cheaters. Devs don't care about the game! Hackers are top ranked over the cash players. No matter how many tickets I opened there is no response. Don't waste your time on this game, unless you wanting g to get away with cheating g.",

Not to mention we payers get harassed in game by free to play players daily! Show some respect to the people who give you a pay check.",

        "WOW. This game has everything! My only complaint is that the \"earning\" free in game currency section (downloading and playing other games to certain level), does not yield in game currency, so do not bother. Just pay for stuff when it goes on sale. But otherwise, WOW! This is like fanfic, sims, empire, battle, idle, all in one! Hpw often do you get an all in one game based off an amazing franchise?? (As of this date, ive been playing for 2 months, spent $10)",
        "I reckon this is the best game in the world!! I am a enormous fan of how to train your dragon, so i reckon you have done an awesome job at making this game. But, the only problem is i don't like the part when it loads and takes forever, and sometimes it doesn't even load and yo have to use wifi and takes up alot of storage on your device. So i sugest decreasing those things or stopping those things.",
        "First everything went out smoothly. Now the assets keeps on redownloading everytime I try to play it. My phone still has 7gb free memory, I also tried following ghe suggestion to clear up some space it still doesn't work. But overall it was awesome. I just hope the issue of redownloading will get fixed asap.",
        "When you complete a level in the currently available adventure, you may spin a wheel. Why do I always get resources? Do I seriously need 18 cards worth of resources, each card worth approximately 1 million fish or wood? Please tweek the chances of getting something else! I don't even mind getting lots of sage fruit at this point... At least it would be useful. Resources aren't really useful when you are filled up on resources.",
        "Love the game. Just wish it gave a little more direction on what and how to do certain things. And wish you didn't have to wait hours sometimes 19 to hatch an egg. But they do give you the option to pay to speed up the process. Also wish that they weren't so stingy with giving ruins/coins to pay for things they ask you to do.",
        "Love it! I downloaded this for my kids who love the movies and TV series, but I've become addicted! I've spent a bit of money over the roughly 6-9 months I've had it, but I haven't minded. The earn free runes has created issues in random phone calls and spam emails, so I don't use that anymore.   I agree with someone else's comment about the Book of Dragons - I found it much easier previously. Also, I've had a red number on mine for weeks and I still can't work out what it's for...I've searched through the book, I'm searching for dragons when I can, and still no idea what it's about.   I keep getting the download new assets but I know that's because my phone is full and I can't delete anything else LOL. I'm looking to upgrade my phone soon so hopefully it will stop that.  Overall, it's definitely a game I'd recommend (and I have). Thanks."

I love The Walking Dead, so I gave this a shot, however, after playing Road to Survival (or whatever it's called- it's the TWD game based off of the comics), my expectations were pretty low. This game though, is not Road to Survival; it's so much more. This is how you do a free to play game with microtransactions right. You can buy a lot in this game with money, but you can easily obtain everything on your own, and quite frankly, it's more fun to do that anyways. This game is super addicting and gives me something fun to do when I've got a few minutes. I've been playing it for months, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.",
        "Just a suggestion, it'll be SO MUCH MORE AWESOME probably 10 stars for TWD fans if you could do better missions or events that allow us to get better opportunities to farm for TWD character tokens or class tokens, and also more chance for farming or creating weapons instead of the current set up now. Don't quite like the fact that when deals are awesome but they cost a ton! Try lessen the value a little bit and im sure some players dont mind spending (just my opinion). But overall review, its awesome for TWD fans out there!",

Thanks for making the Walking  dead show And game. New stuff to do all the time. In wow all these new survivers. There are some loading issues action issues movement issues alot more mission.",

        "Played this game for about 2 years.  Used to be great until the terrible ucool made it completely pay to win.  They have unbalanced and just add new heroes for $100 a month, ridiculous.  Terrible company that only cares about money, for your sake, find a different game.",

        "Pay to win, fun game until middle stages where it one shots your group unless you pay money to get over powered characters. I can't even progress anymore because the boss one shots me every time.",
        "I have been playing this game for a long time now...going on 3 years. It is still an awesome game. For all the people saying it's P2W you are wrong....flat out wrong. Do not blame the devs for your impatience or inability to see the strategy in the game. This game can be completely F2P if you have patience. I do no blame the devs for wanting to get paid for releasing a quality product. Paying for the little boosts here and there give you an edge but give it a month and then the new characters are available through several different means. Keep up the good work!!!"

        "I love this game. I only had one issue , and it was a small one. The fixed it in 24 hours an compensated me extra. I'm happy I wrote this after having the game for a few weeks. I truly can give this 5 stars cause I played it for weeks and have come across the different scenarios in the game. Thank you for your awesome customer service and great game!!!!",
        "Great. But some of the bonus games for golf bucks are not winnable.  For example, long drive gets a longer required result each time you beat it.  I'm currently required to beat 415 yards which I am sure is impossible.  So why bother trying?",
        "Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.",
        "I have played and enjoyed this game just about every day for a year or more now.  For some reason and somehow, they've sucked the fun out of the game.  It used to be about playing and earning \"golf bucks\" to use for things like re- filling your golf bag with irons, etc.  However now, it's very difficult to \"earn\" those golf bucks, in fact, it's even harder to play the game.  Now you can go through a complete hole without having any cards that you can actually play.  Now it seems that all the game is about is paying for irons, etc., and/or watching advertising videos to obtain clubs.  Like I said, I really used to enjoy this game but now?  I think it's time to uninstall it and move on to something that is actually fun, not frustrating.  I'd rate this game as \"0\" now, if it were possible!!!",
        "It's a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it's way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we've all waited way too long it's time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????",
        "People will tell you that it's good for your brain or that it's fun, but that really isn't true, especially since it won't even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can't even think for yourself and try it alone. It's annoying. Don't get it. Go to a different solitary game."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "This is a very cute and pretty fun game, great for when I travel to and from work. There is however LOADS of microtransactions being shoved in your face, so if you have a child that plays this game make sure your account requires a password. A child could VERY easily spend over 1k on this game in less than 5 minutes. EDIT: latest causing some pretty annoying fps issues when zoomed out if you got lots of habitats. The new appentice system is a cute and fun idea, it is however sadly close to impossible to get one..."

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",

I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",

        "Bloons TDs have always been a favorite of mine. But I'm only giving 3 stars because of a technical issue that's mind boggling. I'm on a galaxy note 8, and I start to experience game halting slowdown on level 79. I had played this game on my note 4, and could easily double that before the hardware struggled. Please please fix it",
        "I love this game. It works great on my phone.  My only problem is that I had to reinstall it and I don't know how to get everything back. If you could help that would be great. Also to be totally honest, I'm pretty sure I didn't save it to the cloud or my Facebook account.",
        "Extemely good game for pretty much any age or level of play. Easy to get into and there's enough depth of game that it will take a lot of playing to get bored. Also works well on any platform - I have it on my ipad and Samsung phone. :)",
        "I love this game only problem is I broke my phone and had to get a new one. Trying to figure out how to get everything back. I have purchased alot of things. $31000 and now only have $100. Logged in with my Facebook account still nothing. Help!!!! Please so I can get back to enjoying this game!",
        "Too many bugs. In Co op, you can't send money to anyone if anything is under the menu that comes out to give money and the menu covers a good 30% of your side to do so. Also it doesn't let you play towers close to the outside edge in Co op even though you can in single player. And it is SOOOO stupid after every round, it cancels towers you are trying to place. That makes me mad especially since you can't talk to your team mates during a match to tell them to wait so I can place a tower."

They don't make it impossible to score big ticket items like most games just have to strategize correctly and out in time and just about everything is within reach",
        "Game keeps crashing ,having to re stall the game after every update due to bugs in the system. Very disappointed since I got over charge when buying gems on black Friday, no good hurting loyal high level players by over charging them. Would not recommend game to anyone. And when you do asked a question the customer support team threat you with  no support when you keep asking question over issues or when the update coming. I have found they hate when high level player answer back . I would not recommend game to new players.",
        "March 2018 and it still crashes. Server errors with made up numbers and a broken promise that it will not happen again! Since the last update it's becoming impossible to edit the trains without frequent crashes! Also a different error message number every time! I have progressed very well In the game so far but all the fun is being sucked out by the need to constantly restart the game!",
        "This game was great until the last update. That update has ruined the performance of the game. the graphics geet been improved, but the performance has degraded... please release a new version with better performance, or I will uninstall it... 1 week left",
        "Definitely not a fan of the latest update. Graphics have become very choppy in an attempt to be \"sleek\".  Trains take twice as long to reach the station now.  Game crashes a lot more often.  I hope the developers fix these issues soon....or this may be the very update that finally gets me to quit."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

I won't uninstall yet because I've spent a few hundred dollars on this game.  Please fix any bugs with the Google pixel so I can get back to taping",
        "I love this game and these developers! They took a week of their own time and helped me sync my account, which I bet was not easy. That alone deserves 5 stars, but the game itself is amazing. It's a great time waster and has tons of story and puzzles in the stories if you read them. So overall I give a 10 out of 5 stars!",

        "Game is actually mindlessly fun. Climb the ladder and get stronger, and win tournaments. However, the game is not balanced for casual players and the development put a huge emphasis on pay to play. If you want to climb you really have to give up your life and keep climbing, and pay so you can simply redo your skills as you gain more. Hard to justify committing so much time.",
        "Love the game! That is until I got a new phone(LG G6) that is plenty capable of playing this game. Now it opens to a black screen and sits there. I'd love to continue to play, but unless this is fixed, I'll look for something else, not that I want to...",

        "I'd really like to give this game a 5 star rating. Their customer service is fantastic. The graphics are great. Lots of missions to go on. And they have events every week. Exactly what I'd be looking for in a star trek game. But the thing I just can't get past is the gambling aspect for role playing. All I want to do is role play as a captain of a galaxy class starship. But after a month of almost daily spins at the Dabo table (including spending real money on the vip pass and dilithium, and rolling multiple times a day) I haven't gotten a single galaxy class schematic. I don't want to play borg, or klingon, or older enterprise (hell, I'd trade all of those for just a generic galaxy class). It doesn't seem fair the game doesn't give you a more direct way to role play as your favorite ship. Isn't that the whole point of a game like this?",
        "Great collections of star trek universe, but the game screams micro transactions and gambling around every corner. The game gives you a great concept that gets hindered by currency gates. Only play if you want a nostalgic taste of star trek themed free to play game",
        "I absolutely love this game! It's concept is (though not entirely unique to Star Trek) cool. I just love the voices for characters and would love more characters to have voices.  For the longest time I was a F2P player, and when Events first started I was constantly in the Top 1000 so don't buy into that \"You have to pay to win\" nonsense. If you do put money into this game make it the $4 Monthly Dilithium Card it is worth it $4 for 3000 Dilithium if you can afford it.",
        "Don't listen to the haters who say it's Pay for Play and DB is a greedy company. It's bull, no amount of money will get you where time invested into the game will. Oh, and if the game even loads slow for a second DB is likely to send free stuff. If people complain about somthing...free stuff. So I say keep up the great work! One thing though, I'd be awesome if we could name our starbases. Just a thought.",
        "Progress stalls unless you spend insulting amounts of money (dilithium prices are absurd) to get better characters. In the early days of the game you could progress easily, but now I feel as more high-paying players have joined they want you to spend money to progress, and their prices really are absurd. The game is fun, but they're greedy. In the events especially, those who pay more get significantly better awards. A bit disappointing for those of us that have supported the game with occasional purchases from the beginning.",
        "Love everythinggg tho id like to like i want to controle the ship my self manuver it myself open world like eh thats my piont this might change the game and other peoples view/perspective pionts but it would complete my dream of getting the one thing i always love and always will love star trek.😁"

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

Fights are engaging  and boss fights are spectacular and interactive. You do need a team for dungeons and raids as you can't just 1 shot everything, like in other mobile mmos. I've tried loads but this is the best by far! Keep it up!",
        "Man, this is a perfect 5/7! Out of a crapton of Mu Origin game clones, this is even better than original! Polished graphics, nice player skills set, awesome UI items layout - everything is top notch! The only thing I can wish for is adding camera turn on top of player strafe via joystick. Thanks for the hard work, and please keep it up!",
        "Great mobile MMO! Good graphics and narration so the story stays interesting. Additionally...SO much Co-op and PvP and a lot of things to give an edge. Not P2P dominated either so far. Obviously the grind to 55 is tough but I have a few characters on different servers there still very possible.",
        "I think this game is amazing for an MMO mobile. It has a feeling of blade and soul and WOW and the graphics sre amazing on my Razer phone! Actually feels like a real MMO, and I like that there are character voices.  Only problem I am having is whenever I go to turn the Volume up or down all sound cuts out and won't come back on until i restart the game. So I need to pre-set my volume before launching the game and then not touch the volume while playing.",
        "I'm furious.  First you guys fix the Android problem. Now I run thru the update and a screen pops up that I need to relaunch game because it's out of date. How when I literally JUST watched it update? I've spent a lot of time on this game and really like it but if I can't even get to the character select screen, why would I keep it on my phone. It's a shame, it really is.",
        "Could not even start playing. At the start screen the audio is pushing and choppy. This persisted into the game itself, turning off the music did not help, though turning off all sound did. Not playing this type of game without sound. I have a Note 8, so a top of the pine phone, so it's not me running  a phone that can't handle this type of game"

        "This is just amazing! Once you get started it gets a little tough, but you can have other people help you if your stuck. I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",
        "I'm only putting it as one star in hopes the devs see this, but please find a better way to recover accounts. I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out.",
        "It's not the best game but because I am a fan of naruto my interest in this game might be different than others would think. Overall its a decent mobile game but it could use some more improvements."

The rewards for winning are laughable compared to what you need to actually progress and the spin wheel lands on the worst possible prize every single time. Gee, thanks for the 50 coins every 24 hours!",

I guess the experienced players play against the beginners to master their play. Seems like you would be in a pool of players with similar skills  or number of games or rank.

Also, when making moves the move I make is not the move that happens. Also, when watching the video for the xtra coin: when the video ends the game restarts taking me back to tohome screen to press play to enter back into the game.. Thank you loyal player!!",
        "The sound effects of the tornado is kind of frightening but I don't fear because all the characters are near as I ease on down the road. The characters interactions will assist if I follow the yellow brick road. \"I can't wait to meet the wizard\" I believe I'm going to be granted more golden bricks to extend the yellow brick road. I'm curious like a lion. Lol. The best for the whole family. Thanks!",
        "This is by far the greatest game that I've ever played! A lot of my friends play as well, so I  can enjoy playing for a long time. Caution: Very addictive game!!! I find it hard to stop playing once I start. This is one app that you're going to want to download if you want to have some fun.",
        "I use to enjoy playing this game.  Lately though, there are less power ups to achieve and more of the movie tickets.  I would rather have the power ups than the tickets.  This is why I am changing the rating I previously gave of 5 stars to 3.  Also, you should really have more of the Glenda versus the Wicked Witch challenges.",
        "Great game but I really wish that daily rewards are better. It used to be you would get a crystal ball often, money and other things that to help with game, but lately it has been stuoid little rewards like two coins or one row clear. What happened to good rewards for players that come on every day and expect to get a little help in the game play",
        "I love this game except for ONE big aggravation.   When you win extended life you don't get to choose when to use it.  It starts immediately and sometimes you've been playing to complete a sprint or another section and you CANT play another two hours.   That means you lose that extra time.   Today I've lost a 3 hour extra play and now I'm about to lose another 2 hour play.   Very Annoying!"

        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Would like more customisation options for my character. This game keeps crashing for no reason and doesn't like to reward it's loyal users. It is a fun game if they just let you play it. Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics"

        "The good:  Better than WB1 where the same words kept showing up throughout even at difficult levels.  It's also nice that it shows your previous progress in a puzzle after you're forced to clear/restart it.  And although you'll still see lots of words that aren't part of the answer, the puzzles are themed so you can ignore those non-answers.  The bad:  The ads are very loud and you can't always silence them before they play.  It does not remember your sound choice so don't even think about playing this in the library.  Also, the game now has a ridiculous background that obfuscates the answer boxes making the game almost unplayable.  Finally, there are way too many boringly easy puzzles that you have to go through before you get to see the fun ones.  I almost uninstalled before getting there.",

Spirit Rest runs rely on speed and now it seems after 10-15 minutes (of inactivity, in an idle game) the game becomes unresponsive until you force close and restart, potentially losing what progress you had made. I know this is an implementation to stop bots but it has only made the game more cumbersome than ever before for living players. Please reverse this Ekkorr! Surely you can find some other way to combat bots without placing such a heavy burden on the rest of us.",

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

Sure there is a point where there is a wall, but at least you know your one of the strongest. Plus it makes me want to climb that wall, and topple whales.",
        "Maybe one of the best games that still let you play to win. You can get everything with enough patience and a little luck. If you do want to pay though, it's gonna be pretty expensive and the stuff you get does not really let you advance a lot (unless you actually spend A LOT of money).",
        "+ Easy to play + Good story line + Also easy to get the items + I like the game mechanic  - Need more challenging on battle - Need table of hero type - Inventory items don't include the gear being use  Overall i like this game, very good. Also, more hero will make this game more good. And... adding charge chain attack will be awesome  Edit: After update my account was lost, please fix it",
        "This game is great. It doesnt beat you over the head with paywalls, you could probably play f2p and still have a ton of fun. Graphics are good and mechanics are deep and satisfying. Only complaint is the reddit coommunity, but cant blame the devs for that.",
        "Previous rating was 👍👍. Now 👍.  Content drought at the end of the game with some very expensive in app purchases. End game is killing the same dragon or farming the same level over and over and over...there are daily tasks which are a chore. Hoping for quality of life improvements similar to what the reddit suggests.   I really like the art style.",
        "Great game with the most responsive and generous developers.  The only thing bad about this game is the toxic gaming community.  Full of unjustifiable whiners who are so poor they need their freebies for EVERY event or else they have a hissy fit and threaten to quit game AND also cry koz of nerfs on their heroes and threaten to quit(but really don't). They also attack every person who does spend for the game (casual spender or whale) God-forbid the devs need to also earn for a living."

Ok so they put up power ups that I don't have and want me to buy them.Here's the kicker, if I don't buy them it stays up the whole game and doesn't let me use the ones I have!!!!! Ahhh greed! What a joke. Absolutely unfair. I've never seen anything like it. So so sad. And now since the new update it takes way too long to level up!! They just more greedy with each update. Again, so, so sad.",

        "I really love the concept of completing puzzles, different quests and special side games. The graphics are great as well. I don't, however, like that you're almost forced to pay for tickets or you can play MAYBE one game a day. Needless to say, I'm not spending money to boost up my tickets.",
        "Game freezes and I always lose my tokens. Not fun. I dont play for days to save just to play 2 stupid games",
        "I like this game better than any other bingo app I've tried and I've tried a lot. However the French accent in Paris is pretty bad.",
        "If you are not on a super high speed connection, or buy $100's in power ups or tickets dont plan on getting too far on this gamw.... it lags and doesnt let u bingo if you haven't purchased from the app!!!"

I didn't give it a 5 stars because of some of the programing actions available. The waypoints are sometimes more trouble than they are worth. The programmation is limited to 24 hrs. A ruler would be very useful for projections over 24 hrs. But I am enjoying myself, even if my wife doesn't understand why I should wake up at 4 am to check my course.",
        "A good improvement. My only beef is it cost money to change your boat colour. Be prepared to spend if you need to win. Find a few friends to race against and have fun without spending. Since last update keeps eating auto sail cards but only stays on for a few mimutes",
        "Getting close to perfection, need to keep the update of wind to closer to ugrib actual, but very happy with true effect and updates, like the new features of wind display, much better for present and future course determination.  Please look to make driving dial a bit larger, and a bit less sensitive, and possibly a 1 degree up or down feature, like the arrows  but a +1 or minus 1, as feature on present dial is too sensitive and does not adjust so refined.  From a Canadian point of view, can you look to include some races like Vic-maui, Transpac or even more amazing and local to west coast of North America, races such as Swiftsure or Southern Straights... short but very technically sweet races that are very challenging.",
        "Shame you can buy your way to the front of the fleet otherwise good fun.  So I have crossed the finish line 3 time but just keeps saying I have run aground ?? Hopeless",
        "Is lots of fun and surprisingly addictive.  I do mostly just the Volvo Ocean Race.  Would be nice to have an option to overlay exclusion zones.  Don't need to be enforceable, but more fun for those trying to beat the actual fleet.",

        "I'm a big mahjong player and this game is like mahjong on crack. i definitely recommend it to my fellow mahjong nerds. it's awesome with how many levels there are and boosters and achievements and the whole shebang. not just a regular mahjong game where you can only play the game and nothing more. if you like the whole saving up crystals and buying boosters and earning achievements jawn, then you'll love this game. side note, I also have not spent real life money on this game mostly because I don't need to. I usually will buy stuff for games only because I use the money I get from my Google rewards app cause that money goes straight into my Google play account. so it's not that I'm anti spending money on games, but I haven't yet felt like I needed to. it's not one of those where you need to spend money to have it be fun at all (well, not yet anyway! hopefully that won't change) or to be able to get past a certain point. so I totally recommend this to all my mahjong nerd brothers and sisters!",
        "It is a shame that this game allows one to start a new mod and a day or two later sends the player back to the original mod to collect hats, lanterns or eggs. A more polite end to an uncompleted game would be \"Try Again!\" rather than \"You lose!\" This the most rude end that I have seen on any of these games.",
        "So far its good! Just wish you would not link all your games like you do it bogs the games down. And wish you would fix it so that if you had a game several years ago in which you used your email address you could reuse it even if you can't remember your password",
        "A different spin on the classic MahJong game. It's fast-paced  and sometimes it doesn't respond as quick as I  would like. I wish the game would allow just a little more time because it is difficult to see the different levels to find all the matching tiles.",
        "I love this game. However I do have problems with the loading. It says there is no internet connection which is not true. I have fast ADSL and it is connected all the time. Why don't I have problems with other games then? They all work perfectly. Please look into this matter. Thanking you.",
        "I paid 1.99 for 40 eggs and game earned the other 5... and the \"unique prize\" was 5 gems.... I would think it would be something a little more...idk just more. Other than that, the game is awesome. Love the whole idea. Levels, like any other of the \"saga\" games with mahjong."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ❤👏👏",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player's data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player's stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player"

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

        "Over engineered upgrades which are clearly done as a gold mine for DroidHen. Result is you either pay to win or massive grind. Defender II was more balenced in this regard but still a huge grind too. I think World Raid is a myth since it has never worked. It apperently lasts about 30 second but I don't know since it mostly throws an error. I've gotten in twice and it immediately goes to Stage Cleared with &gt;97% beast life left.",
        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

        "After the latest update, I've only gotten one set of daily quests which populated right after the update. After that, I haven't received any additional daily quest where I can win some gems. Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

Sounds fun, huh?  While the graphics and general gameplay are ok, more and more, its becoming pure pay to win, fighting is way out of balance.  I wound recommend this game until they fix it.",
        "This game has a great concept. But unless you can buy multiple things through the game you get nowhere. You can build up all you want but during certain events you go into the nagative. There is no gamemanship in it just money.",
        "Game play sucks. There is no true info to what you really want ro know about this game or on the net. No way to defend yourself solo. Unless your an idiot and spend money on free, I would not waste time on this game. Ember needs to patch a whole bunch of problems with this game. The game will most of the time always crash when you go to adventure mode or to the dungeons. Look else where, don't waste your time on this one!",
        "It is definitely a money game, it is for people who can afford to spend money to gain the power rule and do away with the ones that can't. It glitches a lot and support will not respond. If they do, its a standard letter that may or may not answer what you are asking. Hmmm maybe a computer.  I dropped down to a 1 they continue to lag, the last 4 heros you have to buy. Instead of fixing the problems,  they are just making sure people who just want to play have fun and spend small amounts of money will be eliminated.  I know of 2 realms that are already dead. There are only 5 realms, this should tell you something. Unless you can afford to put the price of a house into this game, it wont be fun for you. It has now gone to bullying people into leaving the game, you complain  support ignore these complaints  yes war game, bully no 7/24 ke cant farm, cant grow without permission of the bullys and developers  dont care so sad",
        "This game should look after games like lord mobile or Vikings clan war  They add option little by little to become more like them If they do that fast enough then this game is great  I prefer some thing more on this game like troop level 5 Alllll game like this has only t4 Be normal and Do something more then normal to gain more fan",

        "Awesome game with a cool soundtrack, the gameplay itself isn't too challenging and has room for strategy. The only downside as far as I can tell is the terrible multiplayer system which doesn't even work most of the time. But overall this game is a great time waster and very enjoyable.",
        "Good graphics. Good units. Awesome skills. Nice drawings. All in all, this is a really good game 😁👍👌But I have a problem. It keeps stopping everytime I open it. And I've also been addicted to this game for more than a month now 😄",
        "It's been a year since I've last played this, still fun. I've been playing this from day to night as far as I could remember. Hopefully, the bugs where the downloading restarts are solved. Nice Gameply as ever, getting hooked to this once again.",
        "This game is fun and addictive. I like that you don't have to work very hard to get decent leveled characters, and having everyone be overpowered makes the game fun. My only problem is how multiplayer is a little wonky sometimes, mainly when the app suddenly freezes during a battle.",
        "Feels satisfying and stress-free , cute characters too. I just have one problem, when it gives me a notifications of free polygons or similar to that, I go check but I don't get anything. There appears nothing in my giftbox.",
        "Great graphics and music and very f2p friendly for a gachapon game. Lots of banners with guaranteed top tier units so if you follow the Discord or Reddit community's advice on when to pull, you can make the free gems go a long way. The more characters you have, the more quests you can do to get more characters, so it may seem slow in the beginning but eventually your character collection will snowball until you have more waifus than you know what to do with!"

        "This is just amazing! Once you get started it gets a little tough, but you can have other people help you if your stuck. I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",
        "I'm only putting it as one star in hopes the devs see this, but please find a better way to recover accounts. I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out.",
        "It's not the best game but because I am a fan of naruto my interest in this game might be different than others would think. Overall its a decent mobile game but it could use some more improvements."

I loved this game. Now not at all we hold our end of the contact why are you allowed to break the agreement. Its now 2016 an I still no help",

I will update my review with 5 stars when the game us updated again to the way it was.",

They sent me an email today for me to uninstall the game and reinstall it and that they said should fix the issues.

This use to be one of my favorite games but on Android it still is fun but to many bugs and like I said CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS"

        "Love this game but when you are competing with SWGOH for mobile SW content I expect it to be better end game and more Special events. At lvl 8 and there's no more rewards or incentives , so I guess I'm done.   Also, As a busy person I have limited time to play and taking the entire game offline for maintenance, like right now is not a good way to keep me interested.  Dumb move devs.   Edit: good job with update but still need light and dark missions past level 7",
        "You should be matched with someone in your Tier, not 4 Tiers above you. When you play against fellow Guild Members you shouldn't have your levels edited. There should be an option to leave matches during the match. It doesn't make sense to lose because you had something else to do. And here's my biggest problem \"Oh hey, you won that match, here's 30 points.\" \"Oh you lost that match? Lemme just have 51 points from you.\" It also doesn't make sense to have heroes with blasters against melee heroes. They end up at a disadvantage.  Fot example, I was just matched with a level 3 Kylo Ren, as a level One Padme. Sooo fair.",
        "First the unbalance between the factions. Now the match making.. Are you folks fckng serious about it? Your matching a lvl 11 to 13 or 14? How could I win with my lvl 10 troops vs lvl 15 troops? No matter which side I play.. I have a lvl 3 hux and your great system matches me to a lvl 5 anakin with lvl 13 af walkers? Tell me this is a joke.",
        "Won't let me put cards down at mid Battle again and again. Connection will slow you down not your opponent it seems run into this issue way to much. Then issues like won't let you move or play anything but energy goes up",
        "Absolutely love this game. As a life-long Star Wars fan this ticks NEARLY all of the boxes. However, there is one thing that bothers me, hence the \"nearly\". And that is the matchmaking. I'm in tier 5 division 3, and for some reason it decides to pick a person from tier 7 division 2. Of course, I lost because it's unfair. Please sort this out.",
        "My favorite game on mobile right now. It's a mix between a MOBA(League of Legends)  and Clash Royale. You control a hero AND manually deploy different troops in your lane. I've never spent a dime and own all the heroes in game so it is not really pay to win at all. All around great game."

        "So... if this isn't a scam... how can I quit a game before it's over and immediately be paired with the same opponent. Every time I've had an opponent drop out, it takes a few seconds to notify me they left the game. Every day a new reason to NOT pay a cent for this fraud. I play out of sheer boredom.",
        "Players with higher ranks should not be able to play  against players that are lower rank with less experience. Plus the ring challenge if you don't reach  the 30000 you should get the amount that it stops on, instead of 1000 points.",
        "Want to love this game, but it just constantly cheats!! It would be more enjoyable if you could have so many free plays per log in to just enjoy some play, like other games do. Instead you run out of gems right away after being cheated out of one or two games, which really stinks!!  I'm not paying through the nose just to enjoy playing a game. You are too greedy and a big fat CHEAT King and it has really disappointed me, because the game would be great fun if I could actually play it!!!",
        "Uninstalling...too many hiccups! Costs too much too play a simple game of cards. This game is all about making a lot of money for 'King' corporation. Can't really say anything nice about this game. Pretty much agree with the reviews. (didn't even have installed for 24 hrs.)",
        "I agree with the cheating and everything everyone else is talking about, but I also have a problem with the automatic card shuffle in the middle of your turn. Wait for the players turn to end, then shuffle.  I have lost several games because of this.  I now have a 3 lose rule because of the way this game messes with you and then I'm out and won't play for days or weeks, because I refuse to pay for a game that cheats."

        "Used to be one of the best time management games available but they no longer fix the glitches.  There hasn't been any updates or new venues for a long time so think the game is being phased out. The game is free but you do need to buy gold with hard cash to progress. No longer worth downloading, my advice is to find something else to play.",
        "It is an awesome game. It is very addictive and I feel very invested in it. If you don't want to spend any of your real money to buy gold, you sure don't need to. It takes a hell lot more to get everything you want but it's still playable. It has some bugs, sure, specially regarding your wireless connecting but it's nothing major. The levels are really hard sometimes but makes up for the good challenge. Thanks, devs, for the awesome game",
        "I love this game. I play it almost everyday. The only thing I don't like is when you spend your supplies to play even when you win you still lose those supplies to play instead of keeping your supplies so you can continue to play on. Other then that. It's amazing. So download this app and have some fun today, tomorrow, or whenever you have some past time. Thanks Chef Ramsay.",
        "I love the game. But there's some bug issues like   1) login to claim 10golds - didn't happen. Where'd the gold? 2) now I can't even login to social. It keep loading, then kinda leave it at that.   I would rate it 5 stars once this is resolved. It's really getting on my nerves.",
        "Game could be cool but has way too much stuff crammed into the tiny screen of most phones. Graphics need to be simplified so that you can see things easier. Overall, the game freezes and crashes every time I try to play. Spend more time making this game stable and easy to see and it might be more fun.",
        "Up until five days ago I wasn't having any problems with this game and I played it nearly everyday. Now I can open the app but nothing happens when I click on any part of the game. This has kept me from being able to do anything with the game for nearly a week. I've missed out on events and opportunities to move up on leaderboards. Please fix the app. I enjoy the game and I don't want to lose progress because of a technical error."

The only thing that would make it better is if they actually gave out gems. This is their 1 downfall - not receiving any gems at all. Therefore, you are forced to either buy them or select the choice you didn't really want in order to get the free choice. This, of course, changes your storyline. However, you can see at the end of each episode the percentage of your choices compared with other users and its normally in the 90 percentile. Still this is a wonderful game that I would highly recommend.",

        "The game is great.. Awesome graphics and ideas.. Would be nice if there are more players. There are many servers but less players.. Maybe you guys can merge the servers? So there would be more players. Also if avatar emojis features were there, it would be fun to intract with players, like sitting, crying, sleeping, like those in age of wushu.. Other than that This is an awesome game.. Better than age of wushu for me.. And also very addicting..love it.. Hoping for an update..",
        "Great graphic but u need to work on the gameplay more as well. The gameplay doesnt seem very...natural,and u gotta have an option where u can disable \"auto\" for players who dont wanna use that feature.",
        "Hey idiots who complain about auto.  Here's a tip:  Don't use it.  Great game, needs more players.  When going to a quest or npc, there should be an arrow pointing us in the right direction, which will let us enjoy flight mode more, manually.  Servers need merged.",
        "Age of wushu & Sword of Shadows *-* both are my fav rpg from Snail Game (Y) great graphic!!! Made me addicted spend long hours to playing",
        "I love the game as well as Age of Wushu and Sword of Romance, now the only problem i have is that my cellphone gets super hot, I can not touch the screen and have to let the game rest until i can play again. If you can fix this issue that would be great. But thanks for having English version of games like this.",
        "it's fun, but i think they need to improve PvP arena from auto mode only to free control mode, and hope they will make more new bosses. this game is fun and don't need too much RAM and ROM hope this game will have more active player"

That alone deserves 5 stars, but the game itself is amazing. It's a great time waster and has tons of story and puzzles in the stories if you read them. So overall I give a 10 out of 5 stars!",

        "Game is actually mindlessly fun. Climb the ladder and get stronger, and win tournaments. However, the game is not balanced for casual players and the development put a huge emphasis on pay to play. If you want to climb you really have to give up your life and keep climbing, and pay so you can simply redo your skills as you gain more. Hard to justify committing so much time.",

        "Great idle game that you can play as much or as little as you want, even if you only have a few minutes. My only gripe is all the inactive guilds. Finding a guild with an active guild master is virtually impossible, and when the gm quits all guild upgrading is over. It's also frustrating that all the upgrades you earn for a guild stay with the guild so if your guild master comes back after 6 months and kicks you, you get to start from scratch with no bonuses.",

        "This is the best game i could find on the app store, me being a fan of space x and NASA this is amazing! But however the microtransactions changed the game for me. I feel like everyone should get access to these parts, but however those can purchase the premium version of the game cam get early access, supported the development team and the owner as a lot of great work goes into this game, and you only need a few minutes into the game to show how much detail is put in.",
        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though."

It has both single and multiplayer game mode options as well as fun challenges. Collecting cards is addicting and fun. Warning, it makes you want to play  more! One of my favorite things game is how fast it is. Battles are quick but still enjoyable. It is possible to do well in this game without paying. One last thing I like about this game is the support. The developers are constantly updating the game and fixing issues.",
        "Great game, but after the last update the game isn't stable, when you play pvp often the timer freezes and you can't do anything beside closing the game, or you just cant do any action, and then you miss your turn, please fix it, and I'll give it 5 stars because the game is really awesome. Problem solved!",
        "i uninstalled the game but i made sure to bound my account to googleplay however when i installed the game again i cant get my previous progress and have to start over again please fix this.... Overall the game is really good for people who like to play strategically.",
        "For a game called tactical monsters, I was unpleasantly surprised that most units are actually humans and not monsters. Fighting is very basic with only having melee and ranged arrows. No magic, no way to buff allies, not many choices in combat. Overall a very boring and lackluster tactics wanna be type game. Hexes for movement are also very small and no back button to take back moves. I would not recommend playing this on a phone at all- Reply to Camex Games: First, try using spell check next time. Second - I did play several missions past the \"tutorial\" and none of the units given had magic or skills that opened up the game past a hack n slash. Third - Its not my problem to play dozens of hours in your mediocre phone game waiting for it to get interesting. If your game isn't good within the first hour, no one wants to keep playing for the next 10 hours. Fourth - how many monsters you have hidden in the game is irrelevant, as the units you get at the beginning of the game are mostly human, in a game called Tactical MONSTERS. Fifth - Giving monsters 3 basic skills that don't offer much tactical option when you can't customize them, isn't interesting. Sixth -- Add a back button",

        "I wasnt sure about this series at first, but it's really grown on me. The unique art style, interesting characters and immersive world make this an incredible game, especially considering it's a free mobile app! I would definitely love to see more sims like this in the future, (especially with the bad boy type). Seeing it transfer to desktop would be awesome! Overall, everything about this game is wonderful but, like everyone else says, the amount of energy given for free isn't enough! I think it would be wise to either lower the cost of energy actions take, give more free energy out, or split the story into parts in which 1 part can be played for free each day. Other than that it's a great sim!",
        "My absolute favorite of all of the Is it Love games. Colin is an amazing character with an equally amazing backstory, and the way he connects with the MC is just incredible. The twists and turns in each chapter leave me craving more of the story. The energy they give you is somewhat lacking, but I'm used to it by now. Highly reccomend!",
        "Really don't like how the guy treats the girl, what a scumbag! Plus I've been playing for over a week and the plot is unbelievably slow, the energy doesn't last long enough. There are much better otome style games out there.",
        "Well the energy situation is beyond annoying. You only get very little for free and the prices for the energy and just WAY too expensive. I do like the story a lot though and will probably take 8 years to complete the story so I don't have to pay 50 bucks",
        "OK, so I absolutely agree with everyone that the energy you get for free is nowhere near enough & packages are too expensive for what you get. I know, I've bought many. This story particular started bad, but now that I'm at the end, I'm hooked. Please continue to update. I have lots of bought energy going to waste!!",
        "I don't really like the concept of earning energy every 24 hours. But I've got to say every time i see that message when my energy runs out. It leaves me on a cliffhanger and it keeps me in the story. Even if the energy wasn't there i would still play the game to my hearts content! Overall AMAZING story and characters!!"

Cost for outfits/shoes/jewlery are extremely high 189 diamonds for a dress i mean come on. Only can watch one video to earn 1 diamond thats disappointing. I'll give 5 stars if getting diamonds gets easier or mini games to get diamonds would be great.",
        "I Love this game but recently it has disappointed me. To move on to the next task I have to buy an expensive house which I can't afford (Hollywood mansion). I can't even buy the coins to afford it because the coins are so expensive too. There is no way of getting around it, I have tried making movies and moving up levels but I am always stuck with the same problem. I can't even skip the task! I am on the verge of rage quitting this game.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played. This must be the world's NO. 1 game. Please make lessen the amount of money that you have for the London Mansion. Please add more stories as I have finished all the stories (except the London Mansion). The last thing is that this game should have more updates as in my IPad there is a new version of this game. Thank you.",
        "I really do love it, but 95% of the clothing requires a ton of diamonds that are very rare and difficult to earn but when you do receive them you only get a couple. Also, it's very frustrating that searching for random objects consumes your energy. Please, PLEASE fix those.",
        "I would give it 5 steers but every time I try to go into a Beverly hills store my game crashes and I have to close the game and I try again and it keeps happening also the losing is slow. If you fix this I will give it 5. Thanks.",
        "This game is toooo Goooooood. But the dresses are very costly, no new hair styles, in spin wheel i never got 500 or 1000 diamonds, also i want to have this character a baby. Please reduce the prize of the dressed. Also London is nothing in front of a Hollywood mansion"

Another thing is, the bonus blast, it is tok slow to wait for the bees to land on the colonies. Last, the yellow bee. When I finished the game the bees doesn't move smooth. I hate some part of this game! Waste! Every part of this game are waste. All parts of these don't work well. Please repair this application. Please make it compatible on my device",
        "😍😍 I jumped on board this game immediately!  From the original (@310-level) I love this game! I ended up having over  100 hours of unlimited play because of the level awards! I went from level 1-75. In great time! I have nothing bad to say about this game!!! LOVING IT!!! 😙😙😙",

        "I play both Bee Brilliant & Bee Brilliant Blast, and at first this was my fav of the 2. Mostly for gameplay, + the ability to ff thru the long cutesy bonus animations at level completion, but this game fell out of favor with me as B.B. stole it's spot with optional paid ad removal which I was happy to pay, it's not offered in this game. The ads in this game do not even close when you tap the X, instead each ad opens in Google Play at least twice before the X will actually close it. Huge waste of my time & frustration! Also B.B. let's you earn 20x the in game coins & power ups per level, daily challenge, and tourney's than this ad whoring p.o.s.   This game may be fun, but very little reward comparatively & no amount of fun is worth that ad trap hassle b.s.",

        "Most missions are 1 to 8 hours long leaving you bored and playing other games. Want to do ANYTHING, it'll take real money but gives you nothing in return. Now events keep expanding and back to back. Only way to advance is money. Went from pay to play to cash cow. They have terrible customer service and just ignore emails and they rigged the game so some missions you have to buy things with real money. And they actually punish good players and there is zero recourse.",
        "It is an entertaining game. The latest update won't let me play the game. It states there's an error with the map and to reload again. 24hrs now and I still can't play it. Also very very jumpy and takes a  good few minutes before it takes action and that was before this update. It looks cool and is more interactive but so much slower and frustrating.  Otherwise it would be PRIMO. Just not quite there yet.",
        "My first game glitched and didn't load the free black widow quest, or the black panther event at level six. Be careful about buying buildings you don't need yet, I had no way to buy Club A and had to start over.",
        "Too expensive at times to get the best rewards and all the goals. Love the concept and game play. Some adventures take a bit long.  Used to love this game. Have spent a fortune on it. Since the upgrade hate the gameplay....not that I can play anymore. Since the hulk event the game comes up and then crashes.  Give me my thousands of dollars and hours of time back, since it's now useless to me.",
        "After recent update game is not starting. As it is not working just uninstalled. Installed game as new event has started. I thought developers sorted out the issue. But after starting the game it downloads around 500mb data and stopped working. Wow what a beautiful new event.after new update & bug fix still game not opening.23 March still app is not working.",
        "So, a lot of problems have been fixed and now it's actually enjoyable and fun to play again. Thank you very much. Just a thing left to change, please lower the price for Ranking a character to 5, 20000 credits are hard to get, maybe 10000, or 15000 as well. 😀"

        "I'm honestly about to uninstall. I've been playing 3 days and it's making it impossible to complete the daily task. I can't even invite friends... Edit: it won't allow me to invite friends, I'm able to play one game a day unless I continuously buy more tokens...but with ads after every game, they get funding from them. I installed this game because the reviews were the best, but maybe it's just got a grudge against me!",
        "I understand they are trying to make money off this app, but if you are going to charge someone 320 tickets to play 4 cards, the reward should be more than 70 tickets per win.  I mean, really?! Some people want to play bingo, but want something to work toward without being bored.  I played Bingo story and deleted it, because I had a lot of credits, but EVERY BOARD WAS THE SAME.  Also, the powerups in this game should be limited to what you have available, and not have to purchase because you are out of said power up.  It might make more people play if they are rewarded.  .  I mean the quests saying you will win 600 tickets if you complete the quest, but you're spending on the normal side 280+ tickets, really?  And no other options besides watching ad videos for free credits?  And I'm not saying to add a \"download this app and run it for 3 tickets.  Reach level 300 for 40 tickets.\"  Rant over",
        "Everything would be pretty neat, but there should be another way to get more tickets. I've been stuck at the New York state for several days now, cause I can only replay the first stages with the tickets from the daily bonus.",
        "Love it. The only reason I didn't give 5's across the board is it gets costly per game as you gain levels. The games are way fun and you can play up to 8 cards !!!!!",
        "There should be more ways to get or win more tickets and power-ups. I also think the costs per cards increases too much from board to board. Other than those two issues, I love this game. Would play more if there were other ways to get/win tickets, the purchase costs is ridiculous for the middle/working-class.  I'd rather pay my bills than buy fake in-game tickets that CAN'T win me REAL CASH. Thank you keep up the good work.",
        "It's a fun game. You have to be quick near the end beacause the game seem to end while the caller is still calling the last number. You don't get a penalty for daubing the wrong number."

        "Takes 2 mins to load then you have to press \"try again\" 20 times then wait for 2 mins and repeat everything 100x before it can load then just after you beat a boss you have to press try again 100x then it crashes. Best game ever."

        "Screenshots made this game look amazing. But then i loaded this up, and didn't even want to finish the tutorial, (which felt never-ending) because I realized this an exact copy of Hobbits Kingdoms, which I stopped because there was never any actual battles, or  motion graphics. And all of those cool CGi characters don't play as shown in the screenshots. Deleted.",
        "In short this is the perfect pocket game. Strategy meets battles and bloodshed. You can play the game how you like, its not like clash of clans where your forced to be hostile, and it gives you a good start. Honestly, i dont understand why people dont like this game however all the bad reports seemed to be from players of the old game....",
        "Love the game. I've been playing since the realeasd of the game before it became Elves Vs Dwarves. They have done an amazing job with this game. Some things could have been better like a majority of my inventory resetting when i rejoined after the game was bought. But overall a wonderful game either way.",
        "Terrible game. In the original hobbit I was an original world 42, back in dec 2012.  Fully maxed 5 cities 100 billion might every hero in every city was min 250 some were 280. Not to mention had couple hundred mithril left in my account Plus 10s of thousands of troops to unbox.. when i went to update game the merged 6 new worlds and im back to level 1.. lmao stupid move on your end. Loyal player here now gone! Was an awesome game i loved it super fun now... seems to be a joke. Duces",
        "It's ok.. I wish they wouldn't have changed the Hobbit into this. It was a good game but I can't get into it now that they changed everything, I guess they \"stole\" or used the Lord of the rings without permission, probably copyright issues so they changed everything.. Now it's pretty lame..",
        "In server 179 one player might still 640m his troops still not cleared he still no 1 in might rank as he is a small player name . latrobio  of NOTORIOUS alliance please fix this. All others T5 troops cleared.he have lots of illigal troops of T5"

        "I love this game so much... It's just that I hate how long it takes to get story tickets. Four hours for one ticket is definitely too long, especially since some of the chapters are really short, and it makes me sometimes forget that I even want to play the game. I love the storyline, but I wish there were a little more choices that she can make, because it mostly feels like I'm just watching everything unfold instead of being able to choose whether I want to go somewhere with someone or not. Other than that, I really do love the game, it's so addicting and beautiful, especially with the contrast in the characters.",
        "TLDR; This isn't suited for teens. It's more suited for adults.   People are saying it's boring, but it's actually not. It's dependent on age group. I'm 26, too old to enjoy drama. In this romance, your character is an adult working a job, focusing on herself primarily, and thinking of love second. It is good for people who are past the excitement of dating and are more interested in a casual story with love development. The characters are respectful of your boundaries, which is something you learn to like when you've matured. If you want characters that throw themselves on you, this will indeed be boring for you. :)",
        "I started with the FB version of it and absolutely loved it. Love the characters and the story line. Pretty consistent quality, though some stories and characters are written better than others. Comparing to the other games their checkpoints are bit more tough (little more expensive for premium) but it's still worth it.",
        "I absolutely adore this game and all of the Shall We Date? games I've played. My only problem with this game, and several others, are the free diamonds. The options for free coins are mostly only in the lower double digits and the conversion rate is 10 points to one diamond so it's very hard to earn them and I'd be able to play and enjoy more if it was a one to one conversion rate.",
        "I play three NTT Solmare Shall We Date games - and by far, I like this one the best. I've even run through all the different \"tangles.\" With this newest set, Moses and Ike, I shockingly finished during Super Early Bird and can't wait to make my next pick!",
        "One of my favourite Shall We Date games, and I've played a lot of them. The entire story isn't so long (like wizardess heart) and the plot isn't just drama. It's refreshing. It keeps you hooked and there's also a strong independent MC! However, getting enough diamonds to get a premium route is so hard! I've been playing for almost 3 months but I have no way come close to 140 diamonds to pass the last checkpoint. And the only time I use diamonds is the first checkpoint for the \"body\"."

The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really?

        "I do like the game because it is fun.  The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is challenging; however, the new update includes an option to purchase updates to units by way of credits, alloy, and crystals.  The wording is not specific and I wasted quite a bit of crystals, credits and alloy and did not receive what I thought I purchased.  Although I am unhappy and will most likely NOT make any further purchases in this game in the future, it is still worth a try.  Just make sure you do not make the same mistake I did.  I do hope the developer reads this and makes the appropriate chsnges.  Enjoy.",
        "Loved it to begin with and spent a lot of actual money to progress...... but it only helped a little, you have to have deep pockets or too much time to get anywhere. Oh and now it's crashed, having to re install just to see if I've lost all my money!",
        "The competitive balance in this game is garbage. Unless you spend real money and play constantly, you have no chance in this game. Constantly getting attacked by players levels ahead of you no fun. I'm a lvl 8, and to have opponents only need 2 shots to destroy any of my defenses is asinine. Especially for the amount of time and ore it takes to level up. Do not waste your time on this game!",
        "I gave 2 stars.  I used to like this game but not anymore. I am lvl 7 and the only people who ever hit me are lvl 10 bases!!! What is up with that? Don't give me some bs excuse is because regardless, this is not right and I am thinking of quitting because of this.  I'm a paying customer but I won't be spending another dime on this lopsided game.  Thanks for stealing my cash and my time.",
        "Would definitely give at least 4 stars, but there's one thing that really makes me mad: The Attacking/Defending Algorithm. Out my entire squad, I have the least attacks, but I'm the leader, by far, in defenses. I don't WANT to attack anyone yet. I want to farm and get stronger. But I can't do that if I'm getting attacked 7-10 times every hour. Even when I win defenses, I still lose resources. Fix that. Make it to where people that rarely attack, are rarely attacked.",
        "this game used to be good but they have ruined the opponents. being a level 9 on all  units costs more to build to attack than the resources you can scavenge from your opponents. also the developers are allowing hundreds of absolutely identical bases to be produced so even if you decline an attack and are repaired you get matched to a different 'player' but with the same base. it's a disgrace."

Everything is OVER PRICED. Even to just furnish your home. I hope kim and Glu reconsider this as not everyone has money to splash on what you need to progress more quickly.",
        "I've spent probably thousands on this game because I liked it, but I'm having serious problems. Back on March 13Th I bought yet another hundred dollar kstar pack that did not go through. I was able to confirm the order and they \"added it to my account\". The problem is I still haven't gotten it. And I've sent screenshots showing I have not gotten it. I've purchased several other packs of various prices and I've received them all, but I've still, to this day, not received the hundred dollar one. I keep getting bounced around and told \"just do a hard reset\" which I've already done several times as well as turning off my phone and everything. That doesn't explain why I've gotten the other purchases but not this one. On top of that, the \"help\" I've been getting has been taking longer and longer to even respond, each time though I'm getting the same unhelpful answers.  If it was five dollars I would have just forgotten it, but I'm being screwed out of 100 dollars with no answers. I'm extremely disappointed.  Buyers beware.",
        "Pretty cool game. I did buy the small star pack and it never showed up. Kinda lame. If someone could look into it that'd be great. I would just like to receive the stars. Not a refund. Please and thank you",

Even with the dark matter bonuses and increased infectivity from your bacteria slots it takes too many attacks and nanos. The game desprately needs a way to penetrate shields, or reduce shield strength.",

        "The game is a decent enough time waster. However, when you begin getting into higher numbers the game breaks. I have over 100x the required about of bacteria to destroy a planet but it still says i can only take out 99.48%.  I have currently 75.528 oo bacteria and the planet Esloytis says it requires 47.310 nn bacteria to complete, but im at 99.7%. The numbers being dealt with are literally astronomical and unfathomable as a human, but following the progression of the game so far it would seem i have fathoms more bacteria than should be required.",

Too much a pain in the ass when you get stuck on a floor cause you can't beat the boss with current gear but you need to advance to get better gear.",
        "Wow.. I though it an RPG game.. Well ur role is to create an account and that's it... All auto, game play (if any) is rushed..no time to savor the game.. what so ever.. U keep getting full bags.. When u try organizing, it full again in before u finish...and much more.. In my opinion.. It's not a really a game..  well just money sucker maybe.. (Just my opinion).",
        "Picked this game up because it looked kind of like Nonstop Knight, and I liked Nonstop Knight. Unfortunately, it's not LIKE Nonstop Knight, it IS Nonstop Knight. It's a lazy reskin of the same game with more micro transactions bolted on.  Don't waste your time. Nonstop Knight is more fun and it won't do everything in its power to drain your bank account.",
        "Stay away from this game all it does is rollback after you do stuff in game it's so great to get to lvl50 3 days in row to just be knocked back to lvl47 3 plus times a day.  They steal items gained, don't bother to reset attempts, just waste of time.",
        "The gms in this game care nothing for their players. There was a \"rollback\" bug that liked to remember everything you spent, but not any of the rewards or achievements you recieved. After losing over 4k gems, multiple pieces of advanced gear, a very rare talent, countless forge points, and even a rare pet, they decide to give everyone 1000 gems as a \"shut up, take this even though we know you lost so much, but we aren't doing anything else to keep our players\" as a reply pretty much.  The game it's way to buggy and full of support that just doesn't care about their players are all. I would never suggest playing this game to anyone.",
        "As promised here's my edit. The latest update seemed to resolve the issue, at least for me. Although I see in chat others are still having the issue so hopefully this will get resolved for good. Thank you for your speedy service."

It openly offers over-priced items like they are a great deal (they aren't). Most of it's purchase items are more expensive than other games. It has a gem subscription but for only 10 days, most simular games offer it for the full month for the same price, while offering more gems.",
        "OMG THIS IS AWESOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING THE GRAPHICS AND CONTROLS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT!!!!!! Except for the part when you raid somebody and the opponent's team always kills you before you kill them. ANYWAYS IT'S STILL THE BEST keep the updates coming IT IS SO FUN DESPITE NOBODY I KNOW EXCEPT FOR MY FAMILY EVEN KNOWS IT EXISTS GREATEST GAME EVEEEERRRRRR!!!",
        "Multitude of heroes to make your team. Not stingy about giving the player stuff. Potential fun for all, as casual game. Has PvP elements. Energy bar system replenishes when level up and even progresses in size as you advance. Should not be an issue until you get farther in, random energy gains also occur on maps with a little luck. Short tutorial at game beginning is torture to endure but is over in under 5 min. Great free game!",
        "Love the game so far. You could say I'm a try hard because I've only been playing the game for a month and a week and I'm already level 52. With 100% win rate and 83% defense rate  have one of the best teams in the game. And like I said before love it so far but for the next update. You'll should add friendly battles. Such as battling with your friends, clan mates, random players. Etc.",
        "Pretty fun game but I had an issue happy pretty quickly into the game and I'm hoping devs see this and help out.  I bought ten common portals for the 100k gold, after opening the first one the game decided to crash and I am no longer able to redeem my 9 other chest. I change to 5 star if we can this resolved. Thanks",
        "Hi, I don't know if it is a hack or what BUT even if my defenders WON then still it minus my POINTS and it shows that I LOST? Whereas the replay is different. And morover Aria's sand in eyes should also provoke the target. And legendary heroes are sometimes not getting worth. They need Interesting passives. Thx. Plz reply 😘"

        "Nice game but the way they select the game players within the same \"strenght\" is unfair. Because they use infamy to measure your lv but at the same time you can get infamy even when you die in the first seconds of a match. In that way you are obligated to face strong enemies because your team is good enought to win the battle without you. In that case the game delievers a bad experience for the player.",
        "Plz push an update to hide chat button during battles, while battle the screen should be much cleaner with minimum icons on screen or transparent eg weapon icon. Auto on off header which shows ship names icons etc to enjoy the game screen on mobile.  Ship score is added but how know the quality / grade /% over the other strong ships where do our ships stand on that point of the certain ship levels.   Sea texture and colour need to be more improved, i really love the water in the poke'go. The way it appers its great. Plz add weather effects lightings nights Strom snowy etc head lights to ships, Reload animations, ship colour paint jobs decals,",
        "Could you fix the guild rivalry page. After battles when people go to check the quests etc. it does not pull up. Have to exit game and restart. Happens a lot and gets frustrating. Other than that it's a very good game",
        "Good changes, but could you guys bring back the big ol' red BATTLE button? The new one doesn't quite evoke that same 'YAAAARRGH!' feeling of going into battle. Thanks:)",
        "Bear with me here.  How about introducing a pulse that stuns? A yellow item, radius 5, 1 slot point and stun duration probably shorter than the Tesla stun in the respective training level.  OR!  have the fixers pulse gain the ability (training maybe) to stun enemies for like 1-2sec. Same duration as when a Tesla shield is forcefully taken down. (not so sure about the second one, but the first seems good)",
        "I love this game and the fact that all the pictures of the game above aren't hyped up. They are the real game. The game is good and I love being able to select my weapons I'm still figuring the system out completely but it's great overall. The only thing I might ask for is a slightly better tutorial"

It requires unfathomable patience for how many days just to get the whole story. One chapter for 100 coins, I'm fine with it if it has only 5 chapters but aside from too many chapters it has also separated sequels and epilogues. *cries*  Please reconsider changing the amount of coins. Hopes for better system and greater stories.",
        "Loved it,even though at the beginning,i 'm a bit skeptical about it, it is kinda efficient in some way.but i do miss the standlone apps.also the login bonus is quite dissapointing,like we only get 5-10? At least give us a bit of generous amount like 10-20 coins",
        "For anyone looking for an MC who isn't a pushover, try the newer stories. Our Private Homeroom stands out as unusually well-localized, to the point it feels like someone studied the English speaking hemisphere of the Internet for modern slang. I very much appreciate the upgrade in sass and backbone, so it was pretty well done nonetheless. I've been a monthly subscriber for months with no intention to change this.",
        "Prices aren't competitive with paperback books. Why spend $4 per chapter when I can buy a 400 paged book new for $8. Also, the daily login bonus gives 5-10 coins per day; it would take months to unlock a single chapter at that rate. The only thing thia app has going for it is the free story every 2 weeks. 🙏🙏🙏 I suggest making this work more like Voltage's Lovestruck app & also letting us watch adds in exchange for coins."

        "Cost of everything in the game is particularly high. And gems??? Don't even get me started.  They just dropped some limited time dragons in the game, and the cost of EACH them is OVER $100 if you haven't been able to earn that many gems in game yet.  Which takes a very, very long time.  Uninstalling today, casual players beware.",
        "Very relaxing game. I wouldn't say it's a \"time killer\" because after playing for hours you'd probably spend a lot of cash out of your pocket, if you don't want to pay this game calls for lots of patience. If you have PATIENCE you will NOT have to buy anything. I've been playing for almost 2 years now and I have only spent 30$ on the game and not because I felt like i had to but because I just wanted to; to speed the game play up a bit. I have gotten every dragon so far, even the event dragons, and limited time dragons, etc. Without  having to spend any gems. Sometimes it takes days of breeding the same pair but it will work if your persistent and patient! :)",
        "Concept-wise the same as with many breeding games. It's fun, a nice game to have for here and there.  Generally good ideas were implemented into this game. Most dragon designs are really good. Unfortunately I don't understand some of the mechanics in the game like removing something from the market makes you lose this item? I mean the last time I have opened a market on the street, I kept my things I put for sale. :? Please fix those logic flaws.",
        "It's fun enough if you don't take it too serious. I could write a long review but I was in the middle of playing when the game kept asking for a review, kind of annoying. But in all honesty this is one of two games I have consistently played for a long time now, so I really do like it.",
        "I really love this game...i have this one and the other DragonVale. I have alot of fun with my grandkids breeding the different dragons. I will say tho that I would have given this 5 stars all the way across if it didn't take so long to get some of the dragons. We have been trying for the Knarr dragon for months and can not get it. It is very frustrating. If it wasn't for the new events that give us a chance to breed new dragons I am afraid I would have uninstalled this due to it taking wayyyyyyy to long to breed certain dragons.",
        "I've been playing this game for a LONG time. And it continues to keep my interest! It's so fun! And with the constant release of new dragons and events, it stays fun. I wish there were more events, but Hey! It's a great game! Expand that market place though..."

        "It's a very realistic tycoon games. Had lots of run buying 'real' properties as I travel. The market place bidding section is like a trading floor.  🌟  because the bugs are not being fixed and is affecting game play. Added on 5/3/18 I have been writing to you about this issue. The fix you provide doesn't last.",
        "It was a great game..... until they started removing coins from your balance after watching ads.... I sent a support ticket and they told me it is a known issue, but there's nothing they can do to fix it... And they would not credit me back my lost coins!",
        "This game is interesting. It isn't time consuming, which is good and it is still be entertaining.Every 2-3 days I check on the game to wait till my money is full and I buy new properties which, I have to admit is quite satisfying. Especially if you own 100% of it.The only downside I could find is the coins system which gives upper hand for gamers that have money to spend into this type of game. However i still find it entertaining and I'm trying to make my own way through competition into getting first place on all rankings.  Edit:once you get rich you can't buy any properties, they're all cheap and not worth investment. You also need to play the game everyday and look for expensive properties that don't exsist. Buying properties from auctions is also not an option as most of the time it's not worth buying one.",
        "Fun and challenging.  It takes patience to excel. Sometimes the map needs updating (abandoned business block away) but dont buy those. Also id say skip watching ads for coins because they disappear.  Anyways, enjoy. Could be the lifelong game you've been waiting for!",
        "This is a game that is played with the real structures around you (like Ingress and Pokemon Go) but it's for buying, selling, and gaining revenue on real properties.  It's a pretty good game if you're in it for the long haul. The interface and graphics seem pretty old/bland, though.",
        "Great game and app. Developers do a great job updating it to make it better and responding to any questions in a timely manner. Very addicting real situation game. I love it. Just wish they would provide some incentives to those of us who purchase coins on a regular basis."

For the ones who just updated, faction wars will show up within 12/24 hrs however not sure bout quest mode. Been playing actively for over 2 years, but still don't have All maxed out equipment or all maxed out characters. Hackers have everything maxed out which makes a mockery of our equipment.",

My new phone is a galaxy s8 and I wonder if I can transfer my iPhone account to my galaxy. I don't to start over while my other phone have great and exclusive characters. Please help.",

Please make a new challenge a bout those charecters. Also injustice scorpion, undercover cassie cage and others. Please make this right."

        "Just finished a career all the way to the top. Great graphics, gameplay and all that. It was fun fighting opponents with almost three times health and twice as strong as my player and I still beat them. I just thought my guy would have maxed out by the time he gets to the top. The rewards should have been specific to that character to ensure that but after going through all that once and seeing the end of his career. I don't really think I'd like to play the game anymore.. Perhaps it's time to try other games. Great game though.",
        "Game is awesome and awesome graphics. One of my favourite android game. Now listen EA or Google or what ever. Stop it ok stop. Stop giving orange rated players of heavy weight and middle weight divisions from live events. Gimme fly weight or bantam weight. I recommend that the live event should like the it was for Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier live event in which we had to score 10000 or 15000 points. Tht way we would sure and certain of what fighter we get.",
        "Good and enjoyable..  But...please increase the chance to get gold and reduce the price for each box that we need to buy using coins. Also why not make it more easier for us to upgrade the ability for our boxer and fix your server please. Always disconnected by itself. Thanks....keep up the good work!",
        "Well it's great game thou,but you could prove it a bit more as add up some blood which would look a bit more realistic. You could add some refery between fight. And the last thing witch would make many people happy about your game is that you could let us to create a self player, on which everyone could upgrade his own skills and techniques. Don't just leave this comment and make sure you'll make some updates for this game.",
        "As I reached 135 stage the game restarted and I had to started from the beginning from stage 1. All my achivemens have been lost which I have been playing for the last 2 months. Why am I forced to log in with facebook. I don't have a Facebook page or I don't want to do do so then why are we forced to do so? Good game has been runiend by sending me back to tutrals and stage 1. I think they want you to spend money on the purchase and get fighters. As I was on average of getting Bruce Lee.",
        ". I personally think as far as all the fighting games are concerned, this game thus far has surpassed all my expectation. Furthermore, the inquiry regarding the quality of the game I have to point out that the facial similarities and video qualities in any aspect of the game is excellent; not to mention how up to date the game will try to remain as far as the new fighters and new events go. They are pinpoint accurate. Thank you"

        "I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I have to say, I didn't have high hopes when I started. 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop and I wanted to play more. It's a different take on a Final Fantasy game, and it really does feel like a Dissidia game in RPG form. The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

Everyone playing is here to get credits in another game .  Which is why this game has so many downloads  not because it's actually good. The over-sexualized comments in the chat rooms are ridiculous.

Now instead of watching the ads for a bonus turn they tell you there is none then make you watch an ad that was even longer then the one for a free turn and they don't give you anything for doing so anymore.

But the rest of the things r fun. The best thing is..... This game DOES NOT have any adds AT ALL. I would waste my time, or do whatever i can, just for this game to be funner. But plz dont let me pay fees! Im only 7 years old n this is my grandmas account. Tks",

        "This is probably the best horse game I have found so far. The porportions and the way the horses move are very accurate. A lot of horses in games I have seen have disporortionate bodies and are, over all, very unattractive.  The art style is similar to Spirit. Which was a big head-turner for me.",
        "Can't log back in to my old account which I spent money on. Can't get the game to log back into my Facebook and I'm on the same Google account. The game crashes. All the time. When are the problems going to be fixed. This is worse then my beta tester games. Very unhappy also don't expect Ubisoft to help u",
        "I'm playing this game for almost two years, and never get bored. I uninstalled a lot of game's on this time except Horse Haven: World Adventures. At this moment I think we need a Grand Stable for fantasy land, and another land for exclusive horse's, they are so much now on the game. Thank you Ubisoft for this awesome game. ❤️",
        "I would definitely recommend this game to horse lovers. However, it doesn't satisfy me and the quite some Dutch players since it has our neighbouring countries Germany and France but not our own. It feels as if our country is just being neglected. It would be great if someone could do something about this issue.",
        "So i have a problem with the app.......... After we race we should get the pieces to unlock the horses  the amount depends on the which place u get cuz im mostly at my mums but i only have a ipad at my grans (its hers) kind regards Me and my family 😄😁🤗😂😉💙💙💙💙💙🐎🐎🐎 So... i try to activate the horse breeds for 10 diamonds i have 15.. It says i dont have enough FIX IT NOW 😠",
        "It's a great game, I love that I get to interact with the horses and the graphics is good then only down fall is I can't earn money that much and you run out of it quick, and you can't make enough for crops or upgrading, since you have to upgrade alot to get food for the horses."

        "This is the best of its kind for mobile, and one of the best overall. The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST.

        "Lolz.  I loves it.  Features and content are definately revolutionary from the first oac. Erm.... Trading cards,  hellz yeah!! Companions/ mounts features(like most of everything in this game) needs research, and looking into,  but most def a worthy investment. Having complications with the game? Uninstall, re-install,  restart,  search an oac blog spot,  get creative and learn your game as if you were trying to learn your characters skill,  the game is freaking s!(|{!! I give it a 4 never the less,(wich is most likely due to my service provider) due to complications ive yet to resolve.",
        "First, the game won't connect to my wifi so it wanted me to use my data.. Fine whatever. I download it all and as soon as I start, it asks me to talk to a flame knight healer, whenever i hit the bottom right dialogue button or select him/icon he just says 'flame knight to me!' over and over. After hearing this 50 times I'm uninstalling.",
        "Lost my progress in the game and customer care doesn't even bother to reply back. The developers don't even have the sense to sync the game with google play games. I can't even choose my old server. Don't play this game unless you want these people to steal your money and time. The second you reset your phone, it's all gone.",
        "If you are into mmo's then this game is perfect for you. There is stuff that costs cash but you don't need it to play I've played for over a year and haven't paid a dime. Great graphics and controls. A couple bugs but with such a big game it's bound to happen. Perfect for fans of wow or eso",
        "Guys you need to be a bit more lenient about the vigor. I got to level 15 and the vigor wall hits me. I'm new to your game and loving it so far. Just 1 major problem vigor runs out in 1 hour. I can't grind for the festive wings because no vigor. I understand you want money from people but the vigor is not the way. . Add mounts to buy and wings to buy add more cool vanitys to buy instead. If I could buy a flying mount straight up for 20 dollars I would. Or wings for 10 dollars I would. Please fix the vigor.",
        "Truely entertaining. There is a lot to do, and the storyline is engaging. The graphics are incredible without being too showy; in a lot of RPG type mobile games, I find it easy to loose track of my character because I'm distracted by the bright lights and excessive animations of skill attacks. This is often exacerbated by the sheer mass of other characters in an area. I have not had this problem while playing this game; other characters are nicely space and easy to ignore. Also; as a female playing a female character, I apprecitate the lack of obligate bikini armour."

        "This game has some easily fixable bugs that need to be fixed, such as the freezing that occurs and having to restart constantly. Also the mechanic of chests yet not enough keys or the ability to get keys for the chests. Also I believe with how much time has passed the beginner heroes need a new level upgrade to a new max of say 30? Five levels to increase would give better capability for them to balance with the continually growing higher tiered heroes. Overall the game is fun, but it needs bug fixes and an adjustment to it's battery-sustainability.",
        "They lied for months about content, updates, and quality of life improvements. Our money, instead was put towards expanding the game into other countries. They have no plans to be true to their words, and will continue to milk their fans/supporters.  If you challenge any of their lies, you'll end up banned.   People paid big dollars for items to boost success values, and it doesn't even work. I don't know how legally this game has stayed on the playstore.",
        "I hate forced tutorials. Up yours, too, game designers. Clicking on one crate may or may not affect all crates. The darn customers wander all over the store, getting in the way. There's no way to keep them away from the manufacturing section and near the display shelves Little irritants like that are sprinkled throughout the game. With some of them, you have to pay money to get rid of them.",
        "Loving this game. Doesnt feel like a pay to win, doesnt limit how much you can play if you play for free, and paid for bonuses are nice, but hardly game breaking. Small issues hitting certain in game buttons on my phone. Nothing frequent or terrible.",
        "It's a simple, but entertaining game.  It engages both sides of the brain.  The gameplay is is somewhat technical, and the characters and art are stylized, but just generic enough to encourage roleplaying.  My only grief is that you can't rename the heroes and workers.",
        "I really like this game, but it's night. I often have to close out and open up again to get it to work. I've been trying to unlock Albert for a while now but his building isn't in the city? There is no fountain and no way to unlock him. Nothing I've researched has helped me figure this out either. What's going on?"

        "I'm glad that you've finally thrown in 5v5. It's a lot of fun.  I'm aware you're trying to do your own thing as far as mobas go but I'd appreciate it if you'd consider adding a way to set up your own build before entering que. Many mobas do the same and I enjoy putting my own spin on builds without having to sit in the shop menu in game for 30+ seconds attempting to adjust everything from the standard builds.  Just a thought.  Thanks for this amazing game. =)",
        "The game is pretty good and the 5vs5 was the update I have been waiting for. Very easy to play nice graphics and controls are easy as well. But since the update 3.1 I have been getting bad pings but my internet is pretty good above 5 mbps constant an bing are well below 50. So have been getting thumbs down for rude pings. Kindly check i have been playing this gane for almost 2 years now. I dont want to remove the games.",
        "I've playing vg since its been 2 years before 5v5 update. After the updates i was start matching up time was taking pretty long and when it start to play the screen doesn't show up, after that it return to vg homescreen. Vanglory is one of my favourite game in these years and i don't want to take it off from my device. Try to fix the issue pls.thx",
        "Couldn't get free rewards for halycon, I clicked on them and it did nothing. I also had a rare mystery chest key and When I clicked to use it, it did nothing, not even get rid of the key. I had to reinstall and it still didn't work, please, help. I also never got that free chest for creating a profile. Very much appreciated if you help. I also don't know how to claim my five free heroes and one skin .-. And it shows I have no wins, which I do, but please, this really needs to be fixed!! I'm sure it's not just me who is having this problem. I also can't open my EPIC mystery chest, even though I have a key. Fix this.",
        "Nice gameplay, very good looking graphic for a MOBA game, on phone obviously. Very nice and comfortable controls. Impressive multiplayer and, fighting system. But The only problem i found is sometimes i still disconnecting from games due to low internet connection, but i got a solid 10MBps speed. I hope Super Evil MC quickly fixes this up. Really irritating when im fighting with enemy hero and you just \"pop\" disconnected. The others features are just fine.",
        "50 mbps connection with 47 pings tested during gameplay. Every time i start vainglory 5v5, works well. 10 mins in the ping goes to 30000 ms. I close the game and go to speedtest to check if my network works fine. ITS BEEN WORKING GREAT THE WHOLE TIME. i get back on the game and the ping is still 30000 ms till it goes back to normal after 5 mins. 5 MINS LOST. and after the game is over? DESERTER! do not push updates when your servers cant handle it. Its been happening to many players but they keep on thinking its their nets fault. Smh..."

        "Fun game, good story lines, and addictive. I think this is one of my favorite shall we datw games. It's easier to earn the main currency then most of the other games. My only thing I don't nessisarily like is that the story tickets take a while to build back up, although that's kind of a running theme for most of these games and some others take way longer. Over all I enjoy this game.",
        "Fun stories and lovable characters. The only issue is that the amount of jade needed overall for one characters main story is a bit high. I would also like the opportunity to win or use gold/jade to get the side stories. Finally there's almost no point to having gold. The 4 rating is because despite the cost in time and money I still wanted to finish the story. It would be great if we could buy entire main stories.",
        "Please update more stories and events on this! Also, can't you lower the price of tickets? Seems like tickets are more expensive than diamonds. If not lower prices then at least add more tickets like 10 or 15 for 20$? Pretty please! Well either you change it or not I just want to say. I LOVE THEM STORIES ARE DAMN ROMANTIC AND INTERESTING! Love it! Make more event prizes that involves a lot more diamonds and tickets please! THANK YOU LOVE~ | Update: more season 2 of characters please!!!",

It'll make you spend money to fully complete the stories. In between chapters, you are giving a certain amount of time to complete the mini games or whatever the task may be, which is impossible, in order to receive those special pages.  So it's fun, but there is no way to fully complete stories for free...",
        "I really enjoy the storyline - it doesn't involve too much comedy or anything like that - but it isn't extremely serious either. I love the characters, and I wanna unlock everything possible that involves Ukyo. I do feel that the art for some characters Can be a bit better..(eduard's arm Always being up is a bit awkward). My biggest complaint is that there are many hard to reach checkpoints. But other than that, it's very fun and interesting!",
        "The game is quite good till the part i played but the only problem which i have with this game is after the prologue. After finishing chapter 1 part 1 i can't seem to be able to play the story. It goes completely blank. HURTS !! I couldn't even get a chance to pick my choice ;("

        "Brings Back Fond Memories I love this game! I spent countless hours playing this in the early 2000s. The controls are easy enough to understand and the text is legible on my LG V10. I don't if I'd be able to read it on a smaller screen, they are not kidding when they say this is meant for tablets. If you've got a tablet or phablet I can't recommend this game enough.",
        "A classic perfectly adapted to the phone platform This game is a MUST-have for any rpg lover. The D&D mechanics may seem i bit weird in the beginning, but you will learn in time. The replayability value of this game is almost infinite. Personally I have never played any kind of game that would allow me to play as many hours in so many different ways. The game excels in its easy to handle mechanics, fun dialogue, compelling story, great ammount of side-quests that are actually enjoyable. Hands down best Apk for this platform. Worth every penny.",
        "Great Classic CRPG BGII was definitely a breakthrough in its time, but it still holds charm and depth that many newer games can't even touch. I have this game for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and I can tell the chip set on the phone is grinding gears with the games engine. It's playable but only when the right character menu is minimized but it still gets choppy when multiple spells are being  cast. With the specs on the s7 this shouldn't be the case. Hey Developers any input/ advice on how to solve this issue?",
        "Amazing! There's a lot to love.  First, if you played the original, this is just as good with extras.  Granted, it's a bit harder to see everything, but it's what happens when you take a computer game and make it available for a phone.  Beamdog has brought additional characters, adventures, magic items, portraits and voices to the game to expand the character creation.  Some expansions are dull (like the arena unless you love grinding) but more of this rpg is on the way.  It's truly the best classic game reborn.",
        "I have a special request. I have purchased very possible version of the bg series, and have played as long as the game has existed. Call me a war vet asking for a wheel chair ramp but could you guys implement the imput of  points or the option to roll. 20+ years of rolling for stats has earnt me the option. Other than that perfect game, worth every licence for every platform. Either let us input stats with option to roll or make a shadowkeeper for android please.",
        "Game is great, as I've played it on another device. However on Note 8 it does not take up the whole screen, and the usable screen is significantly smaller than on s7 edge, and is barely playable. When I force it to full screen in settings, then touching on sides of screen are not recorded accurately. For example, when I try to resize the text box, it toggles AI instead. Makes the game virtually unpayable."

        "Could not possibly be more of a money grab. There are about four different internal payment systems, but no interchange between them. You can get more by paying CASH MONEY NOW or by waiting until enough time has elapsed for some of them to have increased. If you're looking for something you can play for more than 15 mins, forget it. If you've run out of time in the crystal matching game, you can watch ad's to get bonus time - except when this crashes, so it loses your progress and the cost to get into that level. And then there's the assignments which appear on your list, but aren't available to you until you've gone up three more levels. Utterly pointless and incredibly frustrating.",
        "This is a really good game but I have to agree with other players that the game crashes a heck if a lot and you will find that you pay for items that you never receive. I have contacted them on two occasions about this and fair to say it was sorted. However the last time this happened (about a week ago) I tried to report it but it would not allow me to submit my complaint. Players beware."

        "I'm so addicted to this game! Out of all the simulation games I've played this is by far my favourite. The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don't have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it's worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.",
        "I LOVE this game, and everything about it is awesome, aside from the fact that I just got a new phone and now the time is correct on it (my old phone clock was an hour off), and daylight savings time just happened so while my new phone time is an hour later, my game won't let me play due to the time change. It says I need to go back to my previous time zone (which I haven't moved anywhere, its just daylight savings time). I've already put a suggestion up on your site asking about whether you guys can put an option to change the time on the game for these very situations, or to install a daylight savings time option so it can keep up with real time. Other than that though, I absolutely love the game, the graphics, the game play, and the characters to which I get so attached to, are stunning and beautiful. Y'all should be really proud of yourselves &lt;3",
        "Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it's a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won't be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)",
        "Loved it overall but make the chats last longer without having to reset them as I miss them with school or sleep. Not everyone can use the app at certain times in the day. It doesn't have to last the whole day just a few more hours  or 10. The games good other than that though. It's a good way to pass the time and has a good story.Keep up the good work.",
        "Im in love wih the characters already! Though, its kinda sad that you are forced to be a girl character even if you state that you arent in game. That kinda took me out of the experience a bit. I understand it would probably take a lot of effort to put that option in, but man would it be cool. Keep up the great work!",
        "I've been a long term fan now since 2016 when it came out and I still play it to this day! The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to! I have been in love with Saeran since the Common Route so him getting his own route was like a dream come true! Although, his route is an emotional roller coaster.."

        "Surprisingly deep experience. I suppose the obvious comparison would be to Soccer Spirits. This is a lot more grounded in reality (there's a lot less talking rabbits and little girls who can do magic), but there's more to do. There's also a dry cleverness permeating everything.  UPDATE: I've hit a weird and frustrating wall--the game isn't clear about when its days roll over. I guess it might be UTC (there are several indications that the game originates in the UK), but for a few days, my daily quests were rolling over at midnight Pacific Time (like most of these games that punish players for not playing every day), but today I noticed that there doesn't seem to be ANY consistency regarding when daily quests begin and end. Anyway, I'm docking two stars (I otherwise believe that this is a five-star game) until the game's daily rollover time is clarified. I had a nice streak going, that the game's failure to communicate ruined.",

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more \"proving innocence\" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn't not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend",
        "I really like this game!  The game feels so real. The text messages you send out and get are from your actual time! Oh to make the game more interesting...you go to the dial tone dial 893702 the erase it don't hit call. At the bottom it will say chat, settings, etc. Click on those then go back to dial tone and repeat. This will give you more \"money\" to buy more lives and stuff. This really helps make the game more interesting! I am currently addicted :)",
        "I've been playing this game off and on for ages, I love the storyline to it and the interaction with the other characters - the only thing to make that better would be if we could submit our own responses rather than the two choices given. The puzzles I like, but it would be interesting to have different types of puzzles rather than the same one repeatedly.  Got to the witness protection part of the game and it has frozen on me. I have collected all stars but no interaction is coming up on the text screen so not sure what to do next!!",
        "I left a negative review at first before uninstalling it. After a few days or so, I deleted the review and decided to give it another chance and installed it again. So glad that I did! Now I love this game. I find it interesting with the storyline as well as the puzzles. It does leave me curious about how I'd react or what I'd say if it was real instead of a game. I was hoping to get it on another device, but this game isn't compatible with it. Thank you for this game! I ended up having to start the game all over again since I had to factory reset my phone, so this is 2 reviews in one. I love this game and it's very addicting to me since I'm addicted to it. Even after I get all the goals completed with the puzzles, I still want to continue. Love the storyline since it keeps my interest. Thank you for creating this game for all of us to continue to play and enjoy.",
        "This game is great. It's my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It's so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.",
        "I absolutely love this game but I had something glitch to where I have all my messages but the block buster game said I've only completed the first set of puzzles when I was actually on probably the sixth or seventh. I tried playing along thinking it has to do with someone hacking my messages in the game but to no avail. I'm considering uninstalling and reinstalling I just don't want to go that far back and have to start over with how slow it is to progress. Please help!"

        "This game is awesome and I love playing it. Im trying to build a massive farm in the village. Great time killer and addictive.You can build anything. The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I love this game. When my sister downloaded it on her iPad i was sooo addicted to it and now i am downloading it on my own phone!!!! I really recommend to try it at least for once. If you will do so you will not be able to delete it easily beacuse you will be addicted!!!!!",
        "Remove the villagers plz i hate that they keep coming into the house i build and dont leave i have built 10 houses for me and they just keep coming in and its really inoying"

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

But since my tv can't download apps so I opened d website on d browser on d tv but the room no or the QR code doesn't appear no matter how long I wait. I don't know what d problem is please tell me a solution",
        "It would be a really good game if it stops letting me use my coins then when I'm in the game for not even 5 seconds. It would shut down on me and when I login back in my coins are gone. I will like you to fix that",
        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",
        "Its good but the update mess me up because i have so many song that ived by but now i dont have any of it and there s a limit by purchasing a song 2 songs per day? And what happen to the connecting with fb? What the heck",
        "The new update STILL didn't fix the coin limit. And when I tried to buy something with my coins that I didn't have enough coin for it. I lost all my money and it told me I didn't have enough money to buy it! But it's still a good game. Also please put love ward in the game thanks",
        "Rubbish update. Takes my coins but  phone gets stuck on loading screen, even though the tablet starts the dance."

        "Literally unplayable. Game pauses itself in the middle of races multiple times. I am nowhere near touching the paise button and even went as far as to place my phone on the ground and touch the phone with only one finger on the accelerate button. SOMEHOW the game pauses itself 7 times during that race. Uninstalling.",
        "It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could \"ditch the glitch\" so to speak. Thanks",
        "So hard to beat the game. I'm not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can't buy anything in shop without real money.",
        "Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win",
        "Been playing for a few years and about to quit because every time I have a lead my bike goes forward by itself and starts glitching. Almost feels like I'm being cheated out of a good run. Maybe it's because I don't pay to play. Please fix or I'm deleting!",
        "The one thing that wrecks the game for me is the little hangup glitches that happen constantly.  You need to be precise to win races, and it's pretty hard to do that when the game is always stuttering.  Running on a brand new MotoZ2 Play, btw."

When a player throws his card immediately after collecting the cards from the table, we can't see the card he throws! 4. Extend the number players Blocked! I have to block more!!",

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "Played this on PC, and really enjoyed it for its simple, quirky playstyle. While it does trail off at the end when you've mastered everything, the entertainment value is still strong. Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "It's an OK game with pretty complex party building mechanics. But, it also has terrible progression that almost pushes you to spend cash if you're not patient.    And the controls...  For a mobile game, the controls is not very responsive, sometimes I decided to drag a character to attack and the game decided to instead move the character forward and switches with the front unit, in a game where formation matters, this breaks the whole system, and so in order to prevent that, you'll have to drag it slowly, so it registers properly   The hit box is also pretty terrible, sometimes I decided to attack but then it didn't register because I didn't hit the right hit box.   Overall the game itself is not bad, but it has slow progression and getting the 5* (which is very necessary especially the raid class item) is very hard, definitely play this game if you are a very patient person.",
        "Problems solved. Thank you",
        "I give this a 5. I'm F2P and the ??",
        "It's can be fun game(for a short)if you are not interested in the competitive aspect. If you want to be competitive you gotta spend a lot of real money because of prestige.Prestige xa give you additionnal stats to your unit.  You need to spend more than 800$ to have every stats bonus only avaible with prestige. You can gain a few prestige every year but they increase the prestige cap faster.  Pvp is boring, from bronze to silver all i had to do is put a tank on capture point to win. And now i have been losing 95% of all of my matches in gold( and i cant fall back i silver even if i only losses)  Guild arent interesting if you arent super powerfull as you do 0.1% of what a big player does.  It takes a long time to even be somewhat strong.  Pve is ok but really short if its the only thing you do.",
        "This game can be spendy but even without buying anything, you can still advance quickly. There are known bugs but it is address very quickly. I definitely enjoy the gameplay and involvement of the whole community to grow your team.",
        "Normally, I don't give freemium pay to win games 5 stars, but this one is different. Basically all the money options are crazily overpriced, but if you put the time in they give you tons of premium currency just for playing. I've been playing for awhile and it hasn't slowed down yet. I just wish they had a decently priced option because I'd like to support the developers, but there isn't really a good option, monetarily, to do that. Everything cheap is lackluster and anything worthwhile is expensive.    If you like tactics games this game can definitely holds your attention for awhile."

It was getting tiresome going down to mine, a cave somewhere in the middle to find to restart a mission, then back to the top to smelt/craft. Then you have the auto mining platforms that are movable but one wrong touch and it resets.   Graphics were great.  There are other game like this, that don't spam ads during nongame play, that are equal or better",

Weapon upgrades now stupid requirements - latest needs more obsidian than I've mined in over a year.... Get a grip on reality people!",

This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

        "Finally a mobile mmo that actually feels like a real mmorpg. Nice graphics, skills, open world questing, lots of players. Fights are engaging  and boss fights are spectacular and interactive. You do need a team for dungeons and raids as you can't just 1 shot everything, like in other mobile mmos. I've tried loads but this is the best by far! Keep it up!",
        "Man, this is a perfect 5/7! Out of a crapton of Mu Origin game clones, this is even better than original! Polished graphics, nice player skills set, awesome UI items layout - everything is top notch! The only thing I can wish for is adding camera turn on top of player strafe via joystick. Thanks for the hard work, and please keep it up!",
        "Great mobile MMO! Good graphics and narration so the story stays interesting. Additionally...SO much Co-op and PvP and a lot of things to give an edge. Not P2P dominated either so far. Obviously the grind to 55 is tough but I have a few characters on different servers there still very possible.",
        "I think this game is amazing for an MMO mobile. It has a feeling of blade and soul and WOW and the graphics sre amazing on my Razer phone! Actually feels like a real MMO, and I like that there are character voices.  Only problem I am having is whenever I go to turn the Volume up or down all sound cuts out and won't come back on until i restart the game. So I need to pre-set my volume before launching the game and then not touch the volume while playing.",
        "I'm furious.  First you guys fix the Android problem. Now I run thru the update and a screen pops up that I need to relaunch game because it's out of date. How when I literally JUST watched it update? I've spent a lot of time on this game and really like it but if I can't even get to the character select screen, why would I keep it on my phone. It's a shame, it really is.",
        "Could not even start playing. At the start screen the audio is pushing and choppy. This persisted into the game itself, turning off the music did not help, though turning off all sound did. Not playing this type of game without sound. I have a Note 8, so a top of the pine phone, so it's not me running  a phone that can't handle this type of game"

        "After the last update I started having problem with game interface. I always played this game in left hand interface but now I need to change the interface before each and every hunt. The worst is even if I change the interface to left handed before a dual the game automatically changed the interface to right hand. And after a dual starts there is no way to access the setting to change to left hand. Please fix it! It's like forcing a left handed person to write with his right hand. I don't play duals anymore because of this problem. And I know if I don't play duals I won't get anywhere in this game. Be considerate please and fix it",
        "I love this game and the graphics are really neat but, there are a few bugs that seriously need of fixing. For starters, when I'm in the middle of a duel, it will straight up just kick me off and it will exit the game completely...its very frustrating. Second, why when someone is doing the duel, the opponent gets an extra 20 seconds to complete it?? I have won so many duels but since they get an extra 20 seconds, they tend to beat me when clearly I was ahead when the duel was actually over...please fix this. I really do love this game but it needs debugged to be a badass game.",

        "I'm a big mahjong player and this game is like mahjong on crack. i definitely recommend it to my fellow mahjong nerds. it's awesome with how many levels there are and boosters and achievements and the whole shebang. not just a regular mahjong game where you can only play the game and nothing more. if you like the whole saving up crystals and buying boosters and earning achievements jawn, then you'll love this game. side note, I also have not spent real life money on this game mostly because I don't need to. I usually will buy stuff for games only because I use the money I get from my Google rewards app cause that money goes straight into my Google play account. so it's not that I'm anti spending money on games, but I haven't yet felt like I needed to. it's not one of those where you need to spend money to have it be fun at all (well, not yet anyway! hopefully that won't change) or to be able to get past a certain point. so I totally recommend this to all my mahjong nerd brothers and sisters!",
        "It is a shame that this game allows one to start a new mod and a day or two later sends the player back to the original mod to collect hats, lanterns or eggs. A more polite end to an uncompleted game would be \"Try Again!\" rather than \"You lose!\" This the most rude end that I have seen on any of these games.",
        "So far its good! Just wish you would not link all your games like you do it bogs the games down. And wish you would fix it so that if you had a game several years ago in which you used your email address you could reuse it even if you can't remember your password",
        "A different spin on the classic MahJong game. It's fast-paced  and sometimes it doesn't respond as quick as I  would like. I wish the game would allow just a little more time because it is difficult to see the different levels to find all the matching tiles.",
        "I love this game. However I do have problems with the loading. It says there is no internet connection which is not true. I have fast ADSL and it is connected all the time. Why don't I have problems with other games then? They all work perfectly. Please look into this matter. Thanking you.",
        "I paid 1.99 for 40 eggs and game earned the other 5... and the \"unique prize\" was 5 gems.... I would think it would be something a little more...idk just more. Other than that, the game is awesome. Love the whole idea. Levels, like any other of the \"saga\" games with mahjong."

        "An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It's so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I'm sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/",
        "Elder scrolls legends is a game with a elder scrolls taste and mechanics. Its choices, game modes and progress systems works perfect. It's story is great, and serve as a tutorial for the big part of the game. You can even unlock new dlc and decks through your progress in the game. This is truly a marvelous game. Problems like connection break occurs very rare and does not affect the game. If you like CCG and ELDER SCROLLS, then this game is highly recommended.",
        "Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it's very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done 👍",
        "The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn't know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on \"draft\" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they're putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.",
        "Week 1: *Going to try to make this an ongoing review*. Had to lower this to 4 stars overall, because you have to either pay or grind to access all of story mode. I'm gonna buy it, but I think it shouldn't cost more than $14.99. Just mho. PvP is fun and you actually play LIVE people, not an AI running someone's cards. Level rewards seem generous and worthwhile.  Runs a bit slow, but I know it's my phone and not the app's fault. Gameplay is very fluid and makes sense. I already like it FAR BETTER than Hearthstone.",
        "Fun game! Is very generous with card packs and rewards. Plenty of deck complexity yet easy to get into. The RnG can be troublesome at times, but I guess that's just how card games go. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy card games, specially if you're and Elder Scrolls fan."

That it is locally stored in device. Weird being an online game. Got a new phone. Moved Date and Apps over. Erased to Factory setting. Logged in on new phone. No progress! Signed into Facebook and gmail. No progress! Submitted 3 Tickets on lost account. No reply! 2 Stars! Should at least let people know when signing in to Facebook and gmail it won't save progress. What's even the point in signing into those then? Spent money and lost progress!",

        "Game is skewed towards big money spenders only. You want free play, look for something else. Don't waste your money and time here.",
        "Great game! But it could add some quite big updates to make it awesome. If you add a big update with cool stuff etc, then do a ad about it, I think you could get alot of downloader, just don't make it stupid like those weird new ones, make it interesting. Your sincerely Billy. P.S try not make it full on p2w otherwise it won't be good.",

        "I've tried many TD so far still playing this one..every level in every map is unique..  its cool how I can pick and lvl Heroes but then it takes awhile to add a new one when running out of gems (since gems are needed for Heroes) unless u pay to keep playing or just to wait for tournaments... it takes patience lol but I don't mind playing again",
        "A great game with unique map designs and user friendly controls, free to play if you have patience and play strategically, pay to win if you want to advance faster. It is especially a good game for busy people like me who can only spend 10-15 minutes per day but need to stay in the game for a large number of days to be competitive. Don't try to use items and gems on every maps, it is fun and challenging to clear them without shortcuts. *Tip for developers*: Instead of giving purchase options for Sethos and Phoenix they could go with Yan and Narlax, gives chance for new players to compete also developers can milk in additional purchases.",
        "Great TD game with decent difficulty and NPCs progression while still maintining a pattern making you work to figure out various strategies.  Ads have never been an issue I honestly cant remember where they are.  I think they may only be for like \"double your rewards for battle\" kind of thing.  90% (A) or better in my oppinion.  Mainly cause I want to see more progression.  Note I am only a few levels in so I dont know if theres a pay to get by an immpassable place yet.",
        "*Updated* SCAM! Games slowly bleeds away your gems without mechanics being apparent. (I lost 300 gems in the last 3 days) Good luck unlocking heroes or content without paying $30-40. -2 stars.",
        "Your game is WAY too hard. I am at level 90+ and found the first 3 worlds great fun and balanced but now you have effectively destroyed the enjoyment factor by making the enemies SO strong that you cannot possibly beat them unless you have max level heroes...and the best max level heroes require so much to level up that without paying an absurd amount of real money you may aswell give up.you have broken what could have been the best game on android with selfish Pay 2 win tactics . Uninstalling after months of enjoyment and gameplay.  You need to fix this and make it challenging but not impossible",
        "It's really addicting, a lot of challenges and puzzles for the towers... really loved it! Good job team!   A bit of improvement: maybe an easier way to access the other worlds would be really good!?"

        "This is more of a bug report. The game doesn't show the trail of levels, from the main menu straight to asking to play the next level.  I tried to uninstall and reinstall the app and the issue continues to persist.  Other than that the game is great.",
        "I really enjoy the King games. However, on this particular game, I cannot change the avatar like I can on your other games. When I submitted this the submit option did not work. I am not on Facebook. I am signed in by email. If I could get this fixed,  it would be 5 stars.",
        "Like most King games sometimes you might think its rigged when you can't pass a level but you get within one shot of passing every time, very frustrating! Other than that it's great to have a different match 3 game that challenges and forces me to think through every move. If played for extended period it can be a bit hard going back to a typical match 3 game (like Candy Crush) when you forget to stop sliding!",
        "Addictive and cute! At first glance, I thought it looked childish but after playing it a few days, I love it! Keep up the good work! ❤",
        "Updated 2/2018- well at least we can sorta replay old levels but wouldn't it have just been easier to let us pick which levels we want to replay instead whatever this randomizer thing is doing. This game is infuriating but I can't quit it. At least I have the sense to never spend money on it since there's no advancement.    (old review) You have to let us go back and play old levels. It's really annoying on games where I choose to actually spend extra money, when updates change things like this."

Thank you very much for caring about the people that play your game. Now the only thing I am waiting for is an update so that I have new levels to play.

        "I have not paid a cent for this game, and have never felt forced to. With gradually increasing difficulty levels, the game is never too hard nor too easy. I love the combo of a CCG and a match three that this game has been able to do extremely well.  Not only is the game fun to play but the soundtrack is beautifully composed and the graphics are gorgeously rendered.  If you only want one game on your phone then let it be this one, you will not be dissapointed.",
        "Awesome! This is a great way to entertain the brain! My favorite part is honestly the minigame treasure hunt. So fun!!! Sadly you dont get to play it without Glory.... I don't even care about PvP, but apparently that's the only real option I have to earn Glory and play the minigame... Wish we could get the treasure maps with other in game resources... Or make a second app just for the minigames because theyre super fun...",
        "This game gets better and better with each update. Superb graphics, thousands of possibilities of creating your own unique army, mini-games, guilds... and all of those for free (you don't have to spend a single coin and still be a really strong player). Recommended!   PS. This game is so addictive that should be illegal ;-)",
        "Game is an addictive grind fest! You're always making progress, finding new cards, heading towards guild goals, etc. You can have tons of fun for free, but beware - recent updates are more gem-hungry than ever before. Gems can be earned for free, but not at the rate the game wants you to spend them. Don't feel you have to.",
        "This game sucks! The matching is SOOOO predictable. It goes like this: You move once maybe twice then the cpu goes and guess what. They get like 7-8 moves in a row. Combo after combo EVERYTIME the cpu moves. You don't get the gems you need either. I love jewel games and jewel quest but this game is not the same. Only in appearance maybe. So disappointed. Looks fun. Thought I'd have fun. But it straight up isn't.",
        "Great game that doesn't make u wait for resources to replenish and so far I don't feel like it's pay to win. There's lots to grind for here in a good way. I recommend it. All it needs is some form of instruction. I haven't been able to figure out how the boosts add up. It's been a lot of trial and error."

You level up, which unlocks a new feature, which triggers a tutorial, which forces you to stop what you were doing and do this. Right now. Can't do anything else until you do this tutorial. My last login. I immediately had a tutorial telling me to add my healer to the squad. Which was already added. So, the tutorial forced me to remove her. Meaning after that I had to go back and add her back in. Laggy, annoying, intrusive and begging for money. At least the graphics were good."

Keeps you interested and doesn't require a great expenditure of cash if you are a relatively casual player.  Plenty of good themed events.  All in all a good distraction which I have now been playing for almost a year !",

I actually stopped participating in a game that I've been in for 3 years for I find the is more entertaining, better graphics, quick response time on tickets and the community is more open. Highly recommend this game; which I might add is for all ages and gender who enjoy space battles and strategy. Thanks eh",
        "Love this game. it would be nice to know what kind of equipment you are going up against in war like you see when you are in pursuit mode i.e. DT, CR, MS, BS and what kind of weapons and defense. Thanks for the great game",
        "Great game with a large degree of strategy. Unfortunately, recent changes make it very difficult to obtain good heroes without P2P. This is most likely going to erode the free to play player base resulting in a game that is not as fun to play. Hopefully this can be rectified in future updates.",

Oh an let's not forget the equally pointless (get your hands in your pockets/debit/credit card rip-off) St Patricks day event. Cue no crystal/AP boosters.. Seriously you jokers should all have stripey shirts on with a little printed card with numbers on attached.. What's truly sad is the games good, possibly even great.. But!

Plus they just added a new terms of service that states they aren't responsible for those problems with the game. One of those things could result in you losing all the progress on your account or the account completely.",

My Pokemon have a Miss space of 1 and somehow hit it EVERY SINGLE TIME?!?!?!?! I don't think so homie. Spinner is rigged so don't play if you actually want to be the very best there ever was because the computer will not let you.

        "Love it.♡ I love this slot game. But u don't win enough to keep playing u get to play about 5 minutes then you're broke. Nobody can afford  to buy coins every 5 or 10 minutes  playing the games are fun but you only get like 5 or 10 minutes then you gotta build up your coins and it takes about a day or two to do that so its not worth keeping. You have to be rich to play this game. Uninstalling.",
        "I've deleted this app from my tablet library, and finally for good!  I gave this app a second chance, but to no avail.  Same thing still happens when a video ad is played to obtain free credits (and very cheap with the free credits), soon afterwards, no sound is heard throughout gameplay.  Bonuses don't come often enough, nor is winning enough to even get on the plus side of the amount of credits I began with (slot play not loose enough).  Shoot, I get better gameplay with the real slots in Las Vegas!",
        "Slots Cool slots to occupy my time & play. Just dont take it too serious. I reread the fine print. You have to check all the stars in order to get good pay outs & high bonus spins.                Noticing Im not the only person losing out.. I made a good choice when I decided not to spend my cash money on this game. I would have been ripped off like sever other ppl playing. I have have had several different slot games on my devices. This is the 2nd out of 7 tha hasnt did well.",
        "Was fun till you lowered the bonus wheel amount. Then you keep sending me notifications telling me I won 10,000 credits and I never get them. And also I will have like 50,000 credits when I get out of the app and come back to play later and they are gone. Yeah that's fun. I can go to east st louis and get robbed for real if I wanted that."
