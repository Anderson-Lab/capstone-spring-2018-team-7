     [ 'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!',
       'After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. 😄  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it\'s time for me to kill more zombies 😎',
       'I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn\'t have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time',
       'Be better if i dont get all wepons down to a double barrel and pistol after months of gameplay.   Second time this happened so far.  Good game and story but gota work out the bugs.  Cant play level 8 with a level 1 guns.   Uninstalled the game.  Waste good money playin this online',
       'Excellent story line... Great graphics. I have been addicted to this past few years. Really wondered seeing changes after every update. I never put up my reviews for any app. The magic is, whatever I think about new implementation - it will be done by pikpok in the very next update...... Now I have completed 7th Chapter. No clue what to do next...?',
       'Needs an option to reload your weapon without being forced to empty your magazine. Eg shotguns. Also could use a bit more optimizations as the game does stutters sometimes and that might end your run. Weapons and parts are pretty hard to get so there is alot of grinding involved but other than that it definitely is an improvement to the first game.' ],

       'I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There\'s ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there\'s one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It\'s miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi',

     [ 'Great game, no build waiting times, lots of strategy, a mix of tower defense and rts. Really is a game with a lot of effort put into it from non greedy devs. Well created hiker games. One small point that a future update could sort out is making a feature to create the same bandits again. Rather than manually going in and picking them again. And if you have spares, to automatically put them in place. Also duplicates seem to have no purpose as of yet....',
       'At first I got a clash of clan type vibe due to some mechanic like throphies and graphics. But the game is widely different and in a fresh new way. It\'s basically tower defense where you play both the defender and attacker roles which is done very well.',
       'Love mini games, also building tokens to obtain chests... please keep updates coming! And would love to zoom in more but I dig the overall quality of the game... when can I use my convoy to attack towns and castles?!?! Later on in the game?? Thanks!! And I would buy more gems if the price was reduced... fyi',
       'It was a really great game at first. It\'s a good strategy game like clash of clans where you try to beat 100% of an enemy\'s troops and vice versa where you gotta try to build up your troops (cavalry) so they don\'t take your trophies.  However, it is really difficult to get gold and the game really tempts you to buy game packs or in game currency. Most players in the game are really leveled up too, so it\'s really difficult to move up...  It\'s an addicting game, but I stopped playing because I know I was going to end up blowing my money on it eventually. You will too as soon as you get hooked on it, so just beware.',
       'Seriously... The recent update... Seriously, a major disaster! MAJOR BATTERY CONSUMPTION! My battery drained like craaaaaazy while playing on the new updated version! Please oh please fix it.. I\'ll be giving you a full 5 ✨ for fixing this issue. Playing on Huawei P10 Plus by the way..',
       'This game is  great and is very addictive. The gameplay is smooth and battles are amazing. The only problem that I face is that it never matches me with people with same power in ambush mode.Most of the convoys are always powerful than me. Please do something on this issue' ],

     [ 'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'I\'ve reached on level 93 been at it for almost a week now. And it makes absolute no sense no matter which way I go. For example I will shoot a blue colour to burst the same colour and another colour shoots out. Can you fix this? It\'s frustrating. It\'s a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',
       'Game is fun until you run out of lives. Then you either pay money or watch a video. I\'m ok watching an ad to get extra things, but just to play the game? Disappointing.' ],

     [ 'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'I love playing this game but id give it no stars seeming that there are so many ads and when I collected enough stars for a ghost bike I DIDNT GET IT!! HORRIBLE!! unless you can fix this, you\'re not getting a good review on my hand. Oh and also, for anyone wanting to know, it\'s 21 dollars a month for some bikes. Not in real life. Wow such a great deal... No really a great deal.' ],

     [ 'So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn\'t find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren\'t extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don\'t know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I\'m not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.',
       'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'I think that this game brings back memories of the times that we all played on the first one and seeing this new one with more actions and abilitys and many more things to do is just what I would expect from something from the old stick war 1 game and I just would love to see more stick war games like these overall I love this game and I think it was the best',
       'Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it\'s not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I\'ve survived 24 nights but I don\'t even have the achievements for"survive 5 nights". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don\'t because some of the zombie achievements I\'m not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I\'m currently at 59.

     [ 'Games are great and always challenging although I cannot believe that top place persons can make 3 selections per second and analyze each move.   Update: the more I play this app the more I am sure these top people cannot be making that number of moves in one second. It takes at least a second to view any new cards and decide your moves. I believe a computer is actually playing for them. These top numbers are not realistic! I still enjoy the game but makes me feel really inferior.',
       'Too many ads. I was okay with it at first, the breaking point was when they started playing the audio for an ad in the middle of a game with no warning or screen flash and no way to cancel it. They just started playing noise through my phone\'s speakers. There are other solitaire games out there, don\'t waste your time on this one.',
       'The forced ads are louder than the audio on my phone .. before you reply and tell me ads are how you make money, I want to say I understand that, but do you review the ads before allowing them to be shown in the app? Some of these ads are sexual and offensive.... "Get ready to plow all night" is what one ad says... I\'m disgusted. I\'m done with all mobility ware apps!',
       'As of this morning there is no tab for daily challenges... Which is frustrating since I\'m trying to complete them on the day.  The adverts are ridiculous.. I know we can skip them after 5 seconds but to display an advert after almost every game is beyond frustrating.  Furthermore for some reason my bottom navigation which is found on my screen is never visible in the app, forcing me always lock and unlock it if I want to use the home, back or options buttons.',
       'Used to love the game. But the adds kept getting worse and worse. Just did the update. And a sound add played in the background, and locked me from all functions, volume controls and home button. No better than viruses IMHO.',
       'The game is good, but it would be better without the ads. The biggest bummer is that phone gets rather hot. Walk outside bare feet on a mid-summer\'s day about 1/2 to 1 hour before peak-heat. That\'s about how hot.' ],

       'One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it\'s been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.',
       'I can\'t see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you\'re spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc\'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there\'s better players @ the position that you\'ll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!',

This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can\'t, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru',
       'EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it\'ll be a gamechanger really...it\'ll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It\'s the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦',

MY ELITE PLAYERS ARE VERY UNUSUAL THAT ALL THE SHOTS OF SILVER PLAYER\'S GO IN AND ALL MIND IN +20 ARE NOW WOW VERY NICE GAME EA. Also When playing the auction menu when I did not Win the auction. It supposed to give me back my money coin but it did not happen. It\'s an error on your part so GIVE ME BACK MY COINS PLEASE.

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',

I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',

I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',

For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',

The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars' ],

     [ 'My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I\'ve got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.' ],

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I\'m stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!',
       'Ok its annoying and frustrating if you accidentally press a power up button and waste your zombie coins can you add like a thing lile when you press the power up button down below there would like something pop up like "Are you sure your gonna use this power up?" "Yes or no" to lessen accidents :(',
       'Please help! The game crashed so I reinstalled it, now none of my progress is saved even though I\'m signed in to Google+, this is the 2nd time this had happened and I can\'t start from scratch again. Can someone suggest a resolution Please?',
       'If you\'re quite a gamer, then you should have no problem in facing these brain enthusiasts without the need to buy anything (with your real money of course). Overall, this is a great game, but it needs to improve how they display the plant\'s health/damage/etc. Maybe provide with digits rather than stating the damage is light, normal, moderate, and so on. Oh and i fell that the pinata party is a scam. You will never win the grand prize.' ],

     [ 'This game has so much potential to be an awesome game except for one factor, you require way yo much real money to move ahead. This truly is a pay to win, change that and the amount of people downloading this game will remain playing imo.',
       'Its an alright game and i advise people to play but would be better if people who walk by your clubhouse could be mugged to get more money and maybe sneak attacks would be good so you might be able to take some money without anybody knowing and when people are bringing cigarettes to california you could intercept the vans. Overall great game',
       'Didn\'t like it at first but if you can afford to buy coins a lot more fun. Seals matchups for New York are complete b.s. though',
       'Great game. Cost alot.  Definitely more fun when you have alot of coins.   But bikers do cost way to much. There needs to be an adjustment there.',
       'Really like the game and could be a great game. I would rate higher but there are a few issues. First issue I see is it shouldn\'t cost so much to train more bikers. When you take over territory most of, if not all, the money you gain has to be spent on replacing the bikers you lost. The reward should be higher or the cost of training more bikers should be lower. The other issue I see is the goals section. A lot of them have too many requirements to reach the goals. Make the goals simpler. Also they are not set up in a way to help you progress in the game, they are pretty much random or the goal can not be reached until you are much further in the game. For instance, one goal is to get some properties to level 5. Once you complete that the goal jumps to make properties level 30. That\'s a huge jump and somewhat disheartening. It\'s kinda ridiculous to jump from lvl 5 to lvl 30. It takes way too long to go from 5 to 30 and will prolly make a lot of ppl stop/not want to play the game. Improve the goals section and make the rewards better and it will help make the game more successful.',

     [ 'I absolutely love this game. But sence this update has came out all my trucks seem like there missing a 2nd gear they almost stop at 30mph and makes tbe truck not go pst 30 utill i switchs in the 3rd. Please fix this. I love this game is one of the best offroad games ever. So much more better then gigabite offroad. By the way the motors on this game sound really cheap. But the gane runs vary smoothly on my Samsung galaxy but not on my android tablet.  Please fixe these bug then i will rate a full 5 stars woth no, if, ands or buts. Thank you for your time.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a while and I absolutely LOVE it. but the new update could definitely use some improvements. I have everything in the power category and the suspension maxed out. But everywhere I drive I just flip over and barrel roll everywhere. When I drive foward my truck wants to do a backflip and when I brake it wants to do a front flip. Also, I wish you could change the color of the roof and frontlights (aka the lightbars) but the front light bar doesn\'t even turn on nor does the top light bar that looks like the front one. Please take my review into consideration. Thanks.',
       'Love the game, used to play gigabit off-road but the devs stopped updating and there was nothing left to do. This game has so much, there are some nice trucks, you can have as many of them as you want, and there are some nice customization options. I don\'t know if these are things that are allready in development or your plans, but I would like to see more mud and maybe something like a newer powerstroke/super duty body style.',
       'I love this game so much it\'s so fun and the gameplay is great. it got even with the update but the update also made the gameplay kinda crappy like when i drive on the side of a hill or just drive and turn my truck flips over all the time and it\'s not as fun to drive cars cause the mechanics for the vehicles feel way  different and not as realistic as before the update. Please fix this i love your game',
       'The game is awesome I think you should make it to where you can actually get stuck and dig ruts... I also think that it would be awesome if you created a map with like a small town with paved roads and trails that you can take... Kind of like a few of the maps on baja for ps3 other than that it is an awesome game keep the updates coming🇺🇸💪🤘🔥',
       'Great game just hate the sound the trucks make. Would like to have the option to buy crewcab, regularcab or clubcab on every truck. It would also be nice to have a side dump or axle dump exhaust. Would love to see the old 1993 dodge w250 make it into the game. Would like to see more trucks. Great work' ],

       'Not a clue if there\'s a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It\'s challenging but I\'ve yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though "buying lives"',
       'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'I hate the fact that one can\'t enjoy the game. So many advertising ads keep popping up one right after the other. Interrupting you while your playing the game. It\'s so annoying & fusterating. The game itself is Awesome but with all these stupid ads in the way. One gets feedup.',

I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it.

       'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       '16 energy to move to the nearest forest!! Don\'t expect to build your house or collect resources in a day. This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',
       'As I have not heard of this game (it showed up in my recommendations), I would like to say that this game is beautiful! I do recommend other people to play it. The graphics are highly amazing and basic control is outstanding! I love the idea on how you can pick up items that you put down and rearrange your base the way you want it. Although, I did have several connection issues, but overall everything is in tiptop condition. Keep up the good work!',
       'Quite the gem. Kinda surprising to find a ftp title with actual depth on mobile but so far it\'s great. Looking forward to more updates on the future. Also, to those complaining about energy costs to move to other zones, that\'s only to run there as you can travel (albeit slower) for free of you choose. Not to mention you can speed up this process through crafting later on.',

     [ 'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'It\'s pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It\'s hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it\'s a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There\'s multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don\'t recommend this game.',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....' ],

     [ 'RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent\'s cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they\'re not.',
       'GAH! They\'ve over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn\'t even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I\'m sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn\'t want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn\'t change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.',
       'I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.',
       'Can no longer watch ads to get an extra rewards chest plus, I logged in for 90 days and did not get my legendary chest. My screen froze up when I hit the claim button and had to restart my game. Now my chest is gone and the next level has appeared without me being able to chose what I wanted from the chest.',
       'Caution! Needed access to my personal files including photos to play the game.  I denied and could not start the game unless it had access. Uninstalling after this review.  Don\'t let programmers and hackers get a hold of your personal files!',
       'Graphics are good, game play can be lame at times when you get birds that are incapable of completing the level. You can\'t buy the game and that bothers me. I spent $20, (to support the effort) but am trying to keep it at that.  Others have spent $100 and more. Greed ruins this game. Just finished a level that was designed to be beat only by spending money. Spent hours trying but finally paid and beat it. The game play is not consistent.

I do not mind throwing some money at a well developed game that deserves it, but you never win anything in return. Just want you to keep spending. Such a shame, love several of the slot games.',

Edit 2 Bought $19.99 coin pack during "guaranteed 3x wheel event" only received 2x on wheel, currently have a ticket open with support, if not rectified will be reporting to google.  Edit 1 And the raking over the coals continues, since last update most of my lucky spin levels have been downgraded to silver, such great value for sapphire vip tier.

For when I went back I realized I wasted all that time going to level 7 on big fish games and instead of having 60 gems I have 60 minutes of wasted time. Great game. Horrible reward system. I will rate the game 5 like it should be when I receive 60 gold. Unfortunately I like the game so I will continue to playing. I am level 27 after all.',
       'prices in the game are not well distributed. you can unlock new players only with gold but gold is obtained so hard. on the other hand, money is useless after some point. you can only use upgrading players but it also requires gold. you can obtain golds with watching ads and playing every tournament over and over again to level up and gain gold but after some point you cannot unlock new players (therefore cannot unlock new tournaments) because it requires so much gold. the game forces you to buy golds. fun game but only a short period of time',

     [ 'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'It\'s a really great game! I\'m really looking forward to an update. I think it\'d be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I\'m looking forward to see what you guys do!',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are great😁' ],

     [ 'I love the way the game works, there is a nice progression curve and the mechanics are quite unique. There are only two minor changes I would request of the dev.  - move the health bar of creatures below them, so that we can actually see them (now they are covered with numbers) - as you make progress trough the game, getting a new weapon is more a bane then a boon... it takes way too long to upgrade them to be on par with your current weapons. I would recommend either remove the delay between upgrade and failures (so that you can spam the upgrade button). Or once you own a weapon that is 2 upgrade ahead of the weapon you want to upgrade, you get the ability to upgrade the weapon instantly for the same materials, and an average of gold costs.',

Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.',
       'Wow, awesome game. Great controls and idea. However the following levels all fall on the same points. Christmas, valentine, all about us. These levels have bad music, theme, and overall are not fun. I value the old levels more and find them much more fun to play even f2f or the millionth time than the new levels.

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',

    description: 'Get Ready for the Holidays with Google Play’s Festive Updates!🔫-----It is the year 2072 and the world is filled with zombies. Humans have been driven underground and inside abandoned buildings. A group of survivors named MPS-16 want to gather other living people. They\'re travelling around the world to find supplies and shooters.News from the radio tells them that some scientists are still living out there, somewhere. So MPS-16 goes out to save the scientists in the hope that medicine can be created to save mankind. Dead Valley in the Middle East is the target destination for this extremely dangerous journey.

       '"Not Addictive" A typical scam game which you can tell just by looking at in game item costs. 0.99-$95 per item. Every scam game has those same prices. Like 99% of mobile games, its a super expensive pay to play scam. It also completely sucks otherwise.',
       'One of the best FPS on android. Take it from a guy who\'s played more than a hundred. If you love fps and you love killing zombies, have to try the game. If only there were no limiters such as fuel, (when they already have crate systems to earn money) I would say it was perfect.',

You could get around 40k cash for perfecting area 4 but now you recieve around 14 gold instead that will buy you around a 1k cash... its a joke dont waste your time unless your rich',

My only qurstion would be is it possible to be able to swicth charecters while in a zombie fight i think that would be kool or the option to choose if a.i. activates specials and also have option to wear only player can activate specials. Keep up the good work guys 10 stars if i could.',
       'Great game both as a concept and its graphics. The only problem is the lack of energy. You only have energy for like 6-7 battles and then you have to wait or use gold. Make it at least 10 battles at low levels and keep increasing it.' ],

     [ 'Controls are terrible. Doesn\'t feel natural at all. Have to pay for every park/spot other than the starter park which sucks. Just pay the $1.99 for True Skate. Way better game with more natural feel for the controls and bigger parks/bettter spots. It\'s like going from Tony Hawk Pro Skater to EA\'s Skate series. Give us at least better controls to make this feel better. Fluck it. Not pick up finger to ollie which doesnt even work %80 of the time.',
       'Would be better if you could Manuel between tricks  and if the tricks were in combo with other instead of individually named. Also can\'t seem to feeble, or smith grind:/ Fakie seems to not be working for me, it just registers at regular even though I\'m clearly riding fakie! Also I\'ve paid for this game and haven\'t seen a new park in the past year and the map The Docks sucks!!',
       'Spent literally hundreds of hours playing this when I had an iPhone, it was the best mobile game of all time.. Then I switched to android, and waited forever for it to be ported to android. I was so happy when I found out it had eventually made it\'s way to the play store, downloaded it immediately and bought all of the parks. Then I realised it didn\'t have the option to replay clips or edit them like the iPhone version does. This has ruined the game.. One of the best features was the ability to watch back a line you have spent hours perfecting, edit the clip and share it. PLEASE judt add the ability to replay and edit clips on android like you can do on iPhone and make it the greatest game of all time again.',
       'Needs some fixes. It\'s EXTREMELY annoying when I go to do a nose or tail slide, the game does a boardalide. Even if I\'m blatantly placing my fingers in the right spots on the screen. How do I unlock "Skate". Needs more designs. Better customization.  Also needs to recognize more tricks.  Along with already existing ones to be better portrayed. Should add a mode where the board is essentially floating. So that one may be able to flip the board without wipe out to see how to do a specific trick. Game is fun though.',
       'Awesome game it\'s so fun and like real life skating I use to play this game along time ago when It had the horrible camera angle and it has improved a lot. It\'s not hard to control either. The one thing I didn\'t like was that there is no replay! If you could replay truck it would be perfect',
       'It\'s an amazing game! I also have a suggestion. For tricks, like the ollie and kickflip, it should matter where your feet (Fingers) are, so if your going for a kickflip, you should have your foot higher up on the board and for doubles and triples, your foot should be farther down. I know it\'s quite large and some people may not like it, but it would add more realistic gameplay.  Edit: Also some different trucks would be nice, and also if it had grind marks.  Also you should add user challenges and maps, I know this would be a huge update to make but I know it would make the game so much better.' ],

     [ 'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don\'t waste it here. Good luck!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!' ],

     [ 'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool.' ],

     [ 'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I\'ve made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new "club wars" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There\'s always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don\'t have to spend real money to play the game, but I\'ll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I\'ve even started a second city on another device with my other email.',
       'Maybe the money issue. Hardly get dollars \'even though yall make money off selling them" i feel like if you have alot of people.. And a high hapliness rate in your City\' Maybe you can earn cash kinda easier?',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'I would of rated this 5 stars if I didnt loose all mt progress I tried logging in to google play but it said sorry mayor this city is linked to another device. This is the same phone I\'ve had it on so im really really ANGRY about it so yeah. Help me get my old city back ELECTRONIC ARTS . My city had over 100,000 population I had the airport Dr vu\'s tower and the port and everything else apart from the building so yea. Im so bummed. HELP ME PLZ' ],

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',
       'Super fun and addicting, the beginning levels are pretty easy but they get to be rather challenging after a while!  The only thing I don\'t like is the frequency of the ads.  Game itself is great though.',

       'Good game.  Wish I could purchase ad- free version.  Deleted! I turn volume off for a reason, but then volume is forced in ads, which makes turning volume off option pointless.',

     [ 'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'I play this game every day without fail yet when I\'m due my 30 gold coins for logging in it resets to the beginning....what a con!!! Happened 5 months in a row now. Apart from that, the online racing is full of hackers and imodders making it impossible to win gold that way and to buy gold is just way too much cash for a mobile app game.',
       'Great Graphics. Good Game with plenty of new challenges. Annoying things are cars that you pass continually try to run you off the track. Or jump in front of you at the last second when overtaking. Or spin your car 180 deg when you are braking. Or you bounce backwards at rediculous speed if you rear end a car slightly. Laggy online game play. Has periods where the game goes into slow motion at the most demanding part of a race. Sound drops out occasionally.' ],

PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people\'s choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player',
       'The game is obviously inspired by counter strike. The problem is that the thing that makes counter strike so great is how skill based it is. C-ops is on mobile and mobile doesn\'t have the best and most reliable controls which leaves a lot to luck. Therefore i think that the game should strafe away from being a counter strike clone, and try to be it\'s own thing.

There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I\'m glad I\'m playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.',

The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.' ],

If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. 👌👍❤',

There is 200 million megabytes of free data all over New Zealand, all you have to do is find it between 13/11/17 and 06/02/18 and it’s yours.  Using the interactive map as your guide, find 2degrees Data Pins throughout the country. When you’re in a Data Spot you’ll be able to collect data by spinning the Data Pin to find out how much free mobile data you’ve scored! All the data you collect will be loaded to your 2degrees mobile account. You could win up to 10GB – how much free data can you hunt down? Not a 2degrees mobile customer? Don’t worry you can still join the hunt, just sign up to 2degrees mobile before the 06/02/18 and any data you’ve found will be added to your account. Please note that only 2degrees Prepay, Pay Monthly, Business Choice and Business Connect customers are eligible to redeem the prize data. INTERACTIVE MAP AND DATA SPOTS The Data Hunt interactive map will guide you through the gaming experience. Make sure you have location services turned “on” then you can use the interactive map to locate the many Data Spots throughout New Zealand. When you’re in a Data Spot you’ll be able to ​switch to live view mode, this will allow you to spin and collect Data Pins. DATA PINS Every Data Spot has its own Data Pin, loaded with a range of free data values. When logged in you’ll be able to keep track of your Data Hunt progress, with live updates telling you how many Data Pins you’ve collected and their value. You can only collect data from a Data Pin once, but don’t panic, there are over 1,500 Data Pins to find and there’s up to 10,000MB to be won per 2degrees customer. GOLDEN PINS If you are a 2degrees customer, keep a look out for elusive Golden Pins. Golden Pins will pop up for a limited time every once in a while, track them down and give them a spin to score massive data amounts. It pays to get to these fast, because they don’t stick around for long. SNAP AND SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS Whenever you collect free data you’ll be able to show it off by snapping and sharing a pic with the Data Pin. We’ll be keeping an eye out and getting in touch with the people who post our favourites, so make sure we can see your post by tagging your photo with #2degreesdatahunt.If you think your friends will want to join the hunt, you can send them your unique invite code to score double data if they start playing.  Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

    description: 'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Merge Town!, the newest title from Gram Games. The concept of the game is simple - you have a plot of land, and it’s your job to turn it into a town. Every so often, you’ll be gifted with a house. Each house can be merged with other houses of the same variety to form a bigger home. Every house built on the land will earn you money - the bigger the home, the more you will earn. The more you earn, the more houses you can purchase, and the more you can push the clock to develop faster.

    descriptionHTML: 'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Merge Town!, the newest title from Gram Games. The concept of the game is simple - you have a plot of land, and it&#x2019;s your job to turn it into a town. Every so often, you&#x2019;ll be gifted with a house. Each house can be merged with other houses of the same variety to form a bigger home. Every house built on the land will earn you money - the bigger the home, the more you will earn. The more you earn, the more houses you can purchase, and the more you can push the clock to develop faster.

     [ 'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!',
       'It\'s been nice...I\'m happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you "Dataverse", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can\'t spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck' ],

     [ 'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.',
       'Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.',

It is wonderful for me because there is not a single problem. It doesn\'t seem to be bad for me i  meant the game was not at all bad and it was particularly different from some of the reviews means some people said this game this and that but it doesn\'t seem to me the same thing because each of us has a different choice but according, to me it was great, amazing, wonderful game. Thanks for making this types of games and it is good because it teaches us something so thx once again. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋',

So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',

     [ 'Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven\'t grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it\'d make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there\'s no use for coins.',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I\'m very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing',
       'I am most disappointed about the non existent end game content. I grinded through 60 levels to receive a mere congrats - and that\'s it? Literally no satisfaction from the achievement, and zero reason to play the game any further.' ],

     [ 'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'From beginning to end I\'ve been pleasantly surprised and let down but mainly let down. I was all for this game when it came out but now you wanna make a quick buck on a scenario app... pay more for something that should be part of the game. Overall good game business practices not so much.',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'The game is addictive but when you get to a certain point the cure kicks in and it stops giving away DNA points and it makes it hard to advance in the game. I have read the hints in the news it gives, but I still can\'t manage to beat the game. I want to delete the game. Butim going to continue to try. I just wanted to mention it idk if its the game or just me. I won\'t tell others about the game only because its frustrating to play. These games are not good for people to play that has any type of mental issue unless they want to buy a new phone.' ],

You can\'t do that. but, I still think that this game is very cool!!!! I give this game a 5 star even though my review is about the 3d camera.',

       'It\'s gr8 and all, but there are some things that I want. First is crouching, it\'s impossible to build bridges if I\'m always falling, Second is sound FX, for me it\'s too quiet and the fact of footsteps and moos and oinks and clucks is very good. Last IS everyone\'s game enemy, ADS, ads pop up in a few seconds and when building my first house you can forget what part you were on. PLEASE ADD OR FIX THESE THINGS!!!',

But can you add some skin in this game?this game sometimes show the chat but i don\'t know how to open the chat so please fix it.Oh, and please add some block and food in creative mode because it don\'t have or maybe it have but i think it don\'t have many of it.Please do it like in minecraft pe but not all of it.😊😀' ],

     [ 'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Seriously fun. Didn\'t think its this good. I hoped the distances between planets could be real distance. And also a option to add multiply people is indeed necessary. Cause in large numbers, that for sure player will get there, its exhausting to add lets say 300 people.  So far loving the game. And the fact that its kind of a "pick up and play" type. It would be exelent if the people you add on Europa, are the ones who are in Mars. In that case you would have to add people from Earth in order to increase them on Europa. And with that  u never could leave Earth but u have to keep working with Earth at the first place in order to explore more planets. I think this would make the game more challenging and managing. And the most important one is to have more planet plssss. This could be a historical game with more planets.' ],

       'It\'s a good game don\'t get me wrong but even though you\'ve upgraded things fully you still need to use the spoons to complete certain levels which dose not make sense unless they want you to spend your money to go further. Good game but you can only go so far without spending real money.',
       'Its a great game with good controls but the amount of real money you have to spend is just astronomically bad.

       'I like the game but, you are forced to purchase spoons and boosts. When you get to Paris you can\'t get through level 9 because you don\'t make enough coins to buy upgrades. I used the cook instantly boost and it threw more customers with more food requests at me and they leave because the game doesn\'t serve the customers in order of when they arive. Customers at the end walk up then walk right out, and if you extend time it will send 2 customers when you need 3 or 4. All of these are the reason I won\'t purchase anything on this game.' ],

     [ 'I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I\'ve hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it\'s all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn\'t immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It\'s very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!',
       'Used to be fun to play when there were decent rewards. For some reason the comp room rewards are gone besides small discount options. Ticket rewards are available for shows nobody would want to pay to see.  I have been playing for a few years now and have saved up quite few loyalty points. I guess we are playing for an occasional comp buffet. What a shame',
       'Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I\'ve been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it\'s not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it\'s supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it\'s just a game, it\'s for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that\'s not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?',
       'Great game at first but when you progress you pretty much play for 10 minutes wait for bonus. Started purchasing chips and then they seem to go quicker! I like that is not all win win but damn, throw a dog a bone every once in a while. Basically you throw money away paying for chips and NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER win!',
       'I\'m sick of only being able to play for ten minutes at a time. Would love this game more if I can actually play it but you hardly can win coins, and if you do it\'s a quarter of what you spent on spinning it, and can hardly get coins. If you had more ways to get extra coins rather than paying like watching an ad, or something then that would be cool. Or if they made it so one could not lose 500k in ten minutes while only winning a total of like 5k that would be great cuz I would actually then enjoy it.',
       'I don\'t understand all these people whining about the game. No one us obligated to buy chips. Just stop playing for a couple days and collect your bonuses until you have enough to play again.   I live that I can have fun playing and turn my loyalty points into real rewards. I\'ve been playing allvthe various games since pretty much the beginning and have a blast with them. Thanks to PlayStudios for all the awesome rewards I\'ve been able to use.' ],

     [ 'Simply wonderful app!! My daughter\'s speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it\'s repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn\'t get enough of it! Now we\'ve moved on to shapes and colours that she\'s working through now at 22months. It\'s truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where \'Z\' sounds out as \'Zed.\'',
       'I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!',
       'Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the "a is for apple" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they\'re learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI',
       'Well I can\'t give 5* till I fully know,but my four yr old loves,it she\'s left handed, and has some problems with some words,so this helps with that,so I think its a great app so far',

If you contact support they just send out a form email stating that "Help is on the way..." but they will not fix the issue of bots. They deny that bots are exploiting their app but when told of evidence, they send a form letter denying the existence of bots. They still have not stopped the bots from ruining the fun of trying to advance to higher leagues because they allow bots to exist on their app.',

Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍',

Trust me I hate this and I am sure everyone else who plays this also. Get this removed so that I can play as many times I want and whenever I want! Otherwise your game is great. It\'s a nice app but I might uninstall it because I can\'t play it all the time!',

The game was fun to play until that the tasks had been getting ridiculous that even I was playing with the highest speed I still won\'t make it on time or I won\'t even get as many costumers as the tasks said so, and not only that I\'ve been playing extra job levels and guess what? I\'m not gaining any gems' ],

As the level goes up, maybe the minimum increases slightly.  *Tools!!!! Ive never seen a pawn shop without tools. We need tools *Cars, go carts, motorcyles, 4wheelers. Wheres that stuff at?. *Guns, no guns either. Like civil war era type items, unless these are all avaliable at much higher levels.',

When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss',
       'Best game I\'ve ever played! In fact it is the only game I\'ve had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn\'t sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks',
       'It\'s a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can\'t find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.',

     [ 'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite"ZEUS SLOTS". Not fair, I\'m not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is" WILD STARS"  . However, "ZEUS" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.',
       'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!',
       'People are losing alot of money in this. This game no fun no more. And all u say are im sorry to hear....blablabla....it is imposibble to win and when we win some we lose a alot. Huuge dont care about our complain as long they make money. More player hurts, more player lose, they just dont care as long peoples make them income. Very very bad game.' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ],

     [ 'This is one of the best strategy RPG I\'ve played in recent years. This is exactly what a mobile RPG should be like.   There are a lot of twists and turns, funny and interesting interactions and I like how the creator is also involved in the game. What I love most about it is that there\'s a story being told. Even after you lose (and you will lose a lot) the story keeps going forward.  The thing I\'m not that big of a fan of is the micro transactions in this game, there are quite a lot of em, I understand why the creator does this but if all of the money he gets from micro transactions goes directly to this game in order to improve the game I\'m all in.  Good job on the game, creator!',
       'Your actions have consequences, sometimes applying the F-it adjustment is great for rewards. Also really captures the idea that even though you are being corrupt it\'s for the greater good, an interesting perspective. Absolutely love this game',
       'Very interesting concept, there are a lot of mysteries to solve and the game really challenges you to manage what few resources you have carefully. There are few outright good options, most of them force you to expend a resource in order to obtain another (eg let corporations dump nuclear waste for some extra cash), and sometimes despite your best efforts you get killed by radiation or overthrown by your military.',
       'Stupidly addictive, interestingly hard.  You find yourself trying to beat the game knowing eventually your going to die.... Life don\'t talk to me about life',
       'I haven\'t finished the game yet, but this is WILD so far. It\'s very addicting and has me seriously thinking about the consequences of my actions.',
       'A good story yet simplistic gameplay, which isn\'t a bad thing. Weirdly addictive, as well. only critique is that as you wait to progress the story, esp if you know a major plot point is coming up, most of the gameplay seems a bit gruelling or dragged out to prolong the game. Cool overall tho.' ],

     [ 'I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can\'t find Bradinsky song. It\'s okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol',
       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',
       'When I saw that EA took on the game I immediately purchased it thinking it was any good. The graphics are good, but the controls are nerve-wrecking and the game makes decisions for you. It responds slowly and the block hold works by itself. These little things make you lose and make the game unplayable. Don\'t download it - free or not, look for another Tetris because this does no justice to the original',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.',

Trying to clear the frost moves the screen, pulls down drop down menu from the top, pauses repeatedly, zooms & unzooms repeatedly...nightmare! Game has too much going on with collections, story, various games....to enjoy the game. I like the parts where I find stuff. The rest just gets in the way and bores me.',

I had problems when you updated it before and in the end had a new phone started again and now this problem. Why does problems happen when you do and update. I have got to a good level again and I really don\'t want to start again. It\'s a shame as I really think this is or was the best game I\'ve played.  Please sort it' ],

     [ 'Awesome classic and how a port should be done.  The controls are wonderful, its great using all my gamepads to play. I love how all these great ports to android support that. Playing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, and Sonic CD all with gamepad. Tested on and working great on my Note 3, Note 8 Tablet, Pixel XL, and on Zidoo x10 . Edit: I formatted my phone , i reinstalled the game, clicked on restore purchase, but it takes me to an item not found. 1 star rating until I can restore my purchase, or at least access to a paid version again. Will rate back to 5 when I can play ad free again. Edit2: I found the way to fix restore purchase. Don\'t click restore purchase, just click on buy ad free, and it says it\'s restored and does not re-charge for payment.',
       'I only have negative reviews because untried purchasing this game through the app THREE TIMES.  I still do not have the ad free version.  Please contact me, I purchased the full version so my daughter can have access to all levels, and I still have the ad supported version.   I\'m even willing to pay for it again (so my daughter can have fun) please help me Sega.',
       '4 stars because i dont know how to play as tails/knuckles. EDIT: This game, I\'m starting to get nostalgia, and also, this game brings back the amazing cheat.... DEBUG MODE!!! #SegaIsTheBest EDIT 2: Changed to 5 stars cause I learned to do Sonic & Tails and play as Tails/Knuckles',
       'A fantastic port of a platformer that still holds up to modern titles. It\'s pretty, the music is great, the gameplay is varied and fast, and the overall experience is just pleasant. The touch controls can take a little breaking in but overall they do the job. Unfortunately, there\'s a blemish in the level design that ruins the rest of what the game has going for it: labyrinth zone stage three. The rest of the game\'s difficulty is based around reflexes and timing. The difficulty in this level is shooting the controls in the knee and tricking the player into a boss fight with no health. This level plays nothing like the rest of the title and it makes one wonder if the developers actually knew what they were doing or just caught lightning in a bottle.',
       'Hi there my nephew downloaded this game and he purchased a few things on here without my consent. I\'m disappointed because it didn\'t ask him for permission as thus is a kids game it should have parental permission before buy items on her.  I would like a refund of all my money the ks',
       'I agree the controls are really difficult. I played this game when it first came to the us via the Sega Genesis and those controls were way better. If you truly want to play this game right get one of those joystick accessories, otherwise good luck. It seems to go okay in the levels but beating Robotnic is much, much harder.' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'I\'ve been on Township since 2015 and I absolutely love it. Its the first game I play in the morning and the last one I play at night. This game has so much personality. From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I\'ve played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don\'t have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.',
       'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.' ],

It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',

I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',

On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I\'m pretty sure that if some one who is religious see\'s that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.',

     [ 'Lots of fun and challenging trying to find the best placement for a word to maximize your score.   The one objection I have relates to the dictionary.  When checking a word\'s meaning in the dictionary that any opponent played, and I don\'t recognize,  the dictionary will sometimes say that it is an acceptable word for Words with Friends, but no definition is available at this time.  I believe that when playing a game having to do with vocabulary, no word that does not have a dictionary definition should be allowed!  What determines if it is a legitimate  word if not found in a dictionary?',
       'Have been playing for years and the enhancements keep improving it. This is not Scrabble. It\'s a different game wth its own features. Use those features and enjoy. It\'s hard enough to earn coins to make use of the features a rarity rather than the norm. And Word Strength (always available) is great - you can just accept your lower value word or challenge yourself to work even harder to find a better one. It\'s a great game - especially as once you\'ve had a go, you can leave it for hours (or days!) and only play when you have time. 😊',
       'Good game. Only problem there are games that left for 16 + days and you can\'t get rid of them. Even when you nudge the person ... nothing happens. This impacts on starting new games with those who want to play! Please sort this out. Ads too long in version 2. Would rate better if this was sorted.',
       'Good gameplay. I enjoy playing this game. Great for expanding vocabulary. However, too many words that are acceptable without definitions. Should be a way to submit definitions for words, or maybe link with a dictionary app. Additionally, what\'s with the ads after every move? I end up closing game and restarting, it\'s quicker than watching the ads. If they where shorter, I would let them play.',
       'I\'m no longer getting my bonus points playing the challenger of the day.  I\'m owed hundreds of coins. Also, there is a lot if different words that are playable and unplayable versus the original sctabble board game. There are several editions of scrabble dictionaries that you could update with. Other then that this is a pretty entertaining game.',
       'I really enjoy playing with my friends, just another way to keep in touch even though you\'re miles away! You can also meet and play new folks, as well as play all of the various challenges the game has to offer while you are playing. For example, you earn coins for different words played, difficulty of words played, or words with certain letters. If you enjoy just playing to play or playing for a challenge, this game has it all!' ],

     [ 'This game is a game I can proudly say I will never delete. I hadn\'t played this game for very long but I have loved it so much. The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It\'s never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.',
       'This game has been amazing since early-access. I  have loved it for a long time and will still love it for a long time. One suggestion though. It would be cool if one could emote inside the van once you have got away or have been arrested',
       'Excellent game. Highly replayable. Fun and challenging. My only issue is that emotes switch from one side to the other when playing as a thief vs playing as a sniper. Plus, having to hit a button to fire vs just hitting the right side of the screen is a bit more difficult. Otherwise, almost perfect game.',
       'Love. It. Been here since alpha. Amazing game. Addictive  Classic and orginal.Edit: this gane is way different than what it used to be. First it is really hard to earn alot of money in one go of a match. Also why cant we gain experincw after a match instead of having to pay. The price to upgrade gadgets is way to overpriced. And u lose money too fast.theifs earn little money  Plz reply and reflect on what i said',
       'Excellent game! I love that you can play as sniper or thief, makes the game far less monotonous. I highly recommend getting the starter pack bundle for $1.99 USD if you think you are going to keep playing. It\'s a one time offer that goes away after 24 hours. It includes a sniper rifle that does triple the damage that the starter sniper does, as well as 250k cash and 100 gold and a ton of tokens.',
       'It\'s really fun, has some great mechanics that aren\'t very common among mobile games, and it is simple to play. But there is one problem I have, which takes place as theif. Sometimes, as I am about to duck down behind cover, there is a short time frame where the sniper is able to hit you even though you are behind the cover. This is for the full covers, not the breakable or the half. They can also sometimes hit you when you are at the full covers, which I hate. The only time I get mad when I die in this game is when the sniper is able to shoot me while I am in full cover or within that short time frame.' ],

     [ 'I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It\'s a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don\'t mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It\'s the price you pay to get a good, free game. It\'s not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.',
       'It\'s a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I\'m not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.',
       'I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I\'m going to try another app now.',
       'I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn\'t like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.',
       'It won\'t allow me to add my own pic for background. Maybe too big of a file but I know other solitare let me. I also wish there wasn\'t commercials after the win or lose because they interrupt my music but I hear you guys make money that way so let it be. I\'ll continue to play because I like solitare and the commercials only pause my music and don\'t cut it completely off to play the commercial, like other apps.',
       'Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.' ],

     [ 'So far the best, mostly free, slot game yet. I think a dollar for only one scratch ticket is a bit pricey I mean come on. It\'s only a game. This day and age. More for less, brings more, than less. I\'m not paying a real $1.00 for just 1 game coins scratcher. Otherwise far as for fun. Huuuge is the casino\'s and Slot\'s you should be playing. Definitely a boredom killer.',
       'I\'ve seen some pretty bad paywalls in games, it\'s to be expected...but this game takes it to a whole new level. First 10 minutes playing you will win every other spin, enter bonus games every couple of spins, and win win win..then the paywall. The final 100 plus spins netted me about 5 wins that at least broke even and absolutely 0 bonus spins or bonus games. Definitely not going to pay real money for a game that\'s this tight. Don\'t waste your time. Lots of other slot games that are balanced',
       'Good game when it\'s not crashing. Had it crash 6 times in 15 minutes. Huge payouts during bonus spins. Sitting on 85 Billion that I can spend due to stability issues. Fix this and I will rate the game higher. Playing on Galaxy S 8+.',
       'Awesome game... just like being in a REAL casino.  Every now and then the game will cut out. I\'m hoping it\'s just my Wifi service? ? :\'-/',
       'All the slots are the same with just changed pictures and like every other slot game on the app store they are just money hungry fools...',
       'This game keeps you interested by allowing you to win more often instead of losing all the time. This game is the best slots game I have ever played bar none.' ],

       'Hi guys, we\'re coming to you with a brand new update for the game.',
       'First off, we\'ve added a new Slot! The Jade Gem Goddess is in town, and we\'re sure you\'re gonna love playing it.',
       'We\'ve also made an effort to polish some of our visuals, and as always, fixed some nagging bugs and glitches.',
